                     Dealer'</name> was written, I found the following account of a case remarkably
                  similar to the supposed one, related by the Rev. T.R. England at an anti-slavery
                  meeting at <placeName>Cork</placeName>, in <date>September, 1829</date>:</p>
               <p>'One day I was sent for to visit a sailor who was approaching fast to his eternal
                  account. On my speaking to him of repentance, he looked sullen and turned from me
                  in the bed; of a great God, he was silent; of the mercy of that God, he burst into
                  tears. '<said>Oh!</said>' said he, '<said>I can never expect mercy from God. I was
                     ten years on a board a slave ship, and then superintended the cruel death of
                     many a slave. Many a time, amid the the screams of kindred, has the sick
                     mother, father and new-born babe, been wound up in canvass and remorselessly
                     thrown overboard. Now their screams haunt me night and day, and I have no
                     peace, and expect no mercy!</said>'——<hi rend="italics">Africa sketches, page

            <p>[The following story is found scattered here and there through the pages of a large
               and painfully interesting work, called <title>Narrative of a Five Years' Expedition
                  against the Revoluted Negroes of Surinam</title>: By <persName
                  ref="#john_stedman_1744"> Captain John G. Stedman</persName>.'</p>
 <p>              The author was an Englishman, who partly from a love of
               seeing new countries, and partly from ambition, entered the Dutch service, and went
               out to protect the Colony of Surinam from the incursions of what he calls <name>REBEL
                  NEGROES</name> ; being in fact an independent republic of colored citizens, daily
               augmented in numbers by runaway slaves.</p>
            <p>He is the hero of his own story; and I leave
               him to tell it in his own words. Should any fastidious <name>readers</name> be
               alarmed, I beg leave to assure them that the <name>Abolitionists</name> have no wish
               to induce any one to marry a mulatto, even should their lives be saved by such an one
               ten times.——Editor.] </p>

            <p>'I first saw <persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName> at the house of a
                  <persName ref="#Mr_Demelly_0001">Mr. Demelly</persName>, where I daily
               breakfasted. She was about fifteen years of age, and a remarkable favorite with his
               lady. Rather taller than the middle size, she had the most elegant shape nature can
               exhibit, and moved her well formed limbs with unusual gracefulness. Her face was full
               of native modesty, and the most distinguished sweetness. Her eyes, as black as ebony,
               were large, and full of expression, bespeaking the goodness of her heart. A
               beautiful tinge of vermillion glowed through her dark cheeks, when she was gazed
               upon. Her nose was perfectly well formed, and rather small. Her lips, a little
               prominent, discovered, when she spoke, two regular rows of teeth as white as mountain
               snow. Her hair was dark brown, <pb n="001"/>
               <fw type="pageNum">6</fw> inclining to black, forming a beautiful globe of small
               ringlets, ornamented with flowers and gold spangles. Round her neck, arms, and
               ancles, she wore gold chains, rings and medals. A shawl of India muslin was thrown
               negligently over her polished shoulders; and a skirt of rich chintz completed her
               apparel. In her delicate hand she carried a beaver hat, ornamented with a band of
               silver. The figure and appearance of this charming creature could not but attract my
               particular attention; as they did, indeed, that of all who beheld her. With much
               surprise, I inquired of <persName ref="#mrs_demelly_0001">Mrs. Demelly</persName> who
               this girl was, that appeared so much distinguished above others of her color in the
               colony.</p>
            <p>'The lady replied <said aloud="true">she is, sir, the daughter of a highly respectable gentleman,
                  named <persName ref="#kruythoff_0001">Kruythoff</persName>. He had five children

                  This being inhumanely refused, it had such an effect upon his spirits that he

               <said> discretion of a tyrant, two boys, and three fine girls, of which the one
                  before us is the eldest. The gold ornaments which seem to surprise you, are the
                  gift of her faithful mother, who is a most deserving woman, and of some
                  consequence among her caste. She attended <persName ref="#kruythoff_0001">Mr.
                     Kruythoff</persName> to the last moment, with the most exemplary affection;
                  and she received the gold ornaments in token of gratitude from him, a short time
                  before he expired. Since that time, <persName ref="#mr_db_0001">Mr.
                     D.B.</persName> has driven all his best negroes to the woods, by his injustice
                  and severity. He has been obliged to fly the colony, leaving his estate and stock
                  to the disposal of his creditors. One of the slaves, who escaped from him and
                  joined the rebel negroes, has by his industry been able to protect <persName

                  may chance to meet him in the rebel camp, breathing revenge against the
                  Christians. <persName ref="#mrs_db_0001">Mrs. D.B.</persName> is still in

               <said> attended by the unfortunate <persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName>,
                  whom she treats with peculiar tenderness and distinction.' </said>
            </p>
            <p> The tears glistened in <persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna's</persName> eyes, during
               this recital. Having thanked <persName ref="#Mrs_Demelly_0001">Mrs.
                  Demelly</persName> I returned to my lodging in a state of sadness and
               stupefaction. To some people, this relation may seem trifling and romantic ; it is
               nevertheless a genuine account ; and for that reason I flatter myself that there are
               some, to whom it will not prove uninteresting. </p>
            <p> When I reflected how continually my ears were stunned with the clang of the whip,
               and the dismal yell of the wretched negores, on whom it was exercised from morning
               till night; when I considered that this might be the fate of the unfortunate <rs
                  type="person">mulatto</rs> I have been describing, I could not but execrate the
               barbarity of <persName ref="#mr_db_0001">Mr. D.B.</persName> in having withheld her
               from the protection of an affectionate parent. I have been melancholy with these
               reflections. In order to counterbalance, though in a very small degree, the general
               calamity of the miserable slaves who surrounded me, I began to take more delight in
               the prattling of my poor negro Boy, <persName ref="#Quacco_0001">Quacco</persName>,
               than in all the fashionable conver- <pb n="004"/>
               <fw type="pageNum">9</fw> sation of the polite inhabitants of this colony. But my
               spirits were depressed; and in the space of <time>twenty-four hours</time> I was very
               ill indeed; when a cordial, a few perserved
                  <ecda:food>tamarinds</ecda:food>, and a basket of fine
                  <ecda:food>oranges</ecda:food>, were sent by an unknown person. This
               first contributed to my relief; and losing about twelve ounces of blood, I recovered
               so far, that on the fifth I was able to accompany <persName ref="#Capt_Macneyl_0001"
                  >Capt. Macneyl</persName> who gave me a pressing invitation to his beautiful
               coffee plantation on <placeName ref="#Matapaca_Creek_001">Matapaca
               Creek</placeName>.</p>
            <p>On my return, I took an early opportunity to inquire of <persName
                  ref="#mrs_demelly_0001">Mrs. Demlly</persName> what was become of the amiable
                  <persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName>. She informed me that <persName
                  ref="#Mrs_db_0001">Mrs. D.B.</persName> had escaped to <placeName
                  ref="#Holland_0001">Holland</placeName>; and that <rs type="person">the young
                  mulatto</rs> was now at the house of her own <ecda:anonPers>annt</ecda:anonPers>,
               a free woman whence she hourly expected to be sent to the estate <placeName
                  ref="#Fauconberg_001">Fauconberg</placeName>, friendless, and at the mercy of any
               unprincipled overseer appointed by the creditors. I flew in search of the poor girl,
               and found her bathed in tears. When I expressed my compassion, she gave me such a
               look——ah! such a look! that I determined to protect her from every insult, cost me
               what it would. <name>Reader</name>, let my youth and extreme sensibility plead my ex-
                  <pb n="005"/>
               <fw type="pageNum">10</fw> cuse. Yet surely my feelings will be forgiven, except by
               those few who approve of the <emph rend="italic">prudent</emph> conduct of <persName

            <p>I next went to my friend, <persName ref="#mr_lolkens_0001">Mr. Lolkens</persName> who
               happened to be the administrator of the <placeName ref="#Fauconberg_0001"/> estate,
               and intimated to him my strange determination of purchasing <persName
                  ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName> and giving her a good education. Having
               looked at me in silence, until he recovered from his surprise, he proposed an
               interview; the beautiful slave, accompanied by a female relation, was accordingly
               brought trembling into my presence</p>

               had privately sent me the <ecda:food>oranges</ecda:food> and
                  <ecda:food>cordial</ecda:food>, in <date>March</date> when I was nearly
               expiring; and she modestly acknowledged that <said>it was in token of gratitude for
                  the pity I had expressed concerning her sad situation</said> Yet, with singular
               delicacy, she rejected every proposal of becoming mine upon any terms. She said,
                  <said>that if I soon returned to Europe, she must either be parted from me
                  forever, or accompany me to a land where</said>

               <said>the inferiority of her condition must prove a great disadvantage to her
                  benefact and to herself; and in either of these cases, she should be most

            <p><persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName> returned to her
                  <ecda:anonPers>aunt's</ecda:anonPers> house firmly persisting in these sentiments.
               I could only request <persName ref="#mr_lolkens_0001">Mr. Lolkens</persName> to
               afford her all the protection in his power; and that she might, at elast for some

            <p>"Notwithstanding my resolution of living retired, I was again drawn into the vortex
               of dissipation; and I did not escape without the punishment I deserved. I was
               suddenly seized with a dreadful fever; and such was its violence, that in a few days
               I was entirely given over. In this situation, I lay in my hammock until the

               consequence, even among the nearest acquaintance. The inhabitants of the colony, it

                  of her sisters</ecda:anonPers>, to my unspeakable surprise and joy. She told me
                  <said>she had heard of my forlorn situation; and if I still entertained for her

               the offer; and by her unwearied care and attention, I had the good fortunre to regain

                  purchase of my freedom is apparently impossible; it certainly will prove difficult
                  and expensive. Yet though I am a slave, I hope I have a soul not inferior to
                  Europeans. I do not blush to avow the great regard I have for one, who has
                  distinguished me so much above others of my unhappy birth. You have, sir, pitied
                  me; and now, independent of every other thought, I have pride in throwing myself
                  at your feet, till fate shall part us, or my conduct become such as to give you
                  cause to banish me from your presence' </ecda:embSN>

            <p>She uttered this with a timid, downcast look, and the tears fell fast upon her
               heaving bosom, while she held her companion by the hand"</p>
            <p>From that moment this excellent creature was mine; nor had I ever any cause to repent
               of the step I had taken.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit to record, that having purchased for her <ecda:commodity>bridal
                  presents</ecda:commodity>, to the value of <measure commodity="bridal presents"
                  >twenty guineas,</measure> I was greatly astonished to see my gold returned upon

            <p><said aloud="true">'Your generous intentions toward me are sufficient, sir.'</said>
               said she: <said aloud="true">allow me to say that I consider any superfluons expense
                  on my account as a diminution of that good opinion, which I hope you now, and ever
                  will, entertain concerning my disinterested disposition'</said></p>
            <p>Such was the language of a slave who had simple nature only for her instructor. The
               purity of her sentiments requires no comments of mine; I respected them, and resolved
               to improve them by every care.</p>
            <p>Regard for her superior virtues, gratitude for her particular attention to me, and
               the pleasure of introducing to the world a character so estimable, rising from a
               situation usually so hopeless and degraded——these considerations embolden me to risk
               the censure of my <name>readers</name>, by intruding this subject upon their
               attention. If my apology be accepted even by a few, I shall not feel inclined to
               complain</p>
            <p>In the evening, I visited <persName ref="#Mr_demelly_0001">Mr. Demelly</persName> and
               his lady, who congratulated me on my recovery; and, strange as it may appear to many

               <fw type="pageNum">15</fw> wished me joy of what they were pleased to call my
               conquest. <ecda:anonPers>One lady</ecda:anonPers> assured me that I was censured by
               some, applauded by many, but she believed in her heart to be envied by all.</p>
            <p>Many of our respectable friends sanctioned the wedding by their presence; and I was
               as happy as any bridegroom ever was.</p>
            <p>Thus concludes a chapter, which, methinks I hear many of my <name>readers</name>
               whisper, had better never had a beginning</p>

               declared they were sacrificed to no manner of purpose. By the distribution of some

            <p>On the ninth, we marched to the port called <name>Devil's Harwar</name>, leaving ten
               men behind, some with agues, some stung blind, and some with their feet full of
               tormenting insects called <ecda:fauna>chigoes</ecda:fauna>.After indescribable
               sufferings we arrived, covered with mud and blood. I was rejoiced to find <persName

               taken command; I hoped at last to meet with some relief. Having ceded to him my

               from my <persName ref="#joanna_0001">Joanna</persName>. The surgeons declared that I

               <fw type="pageNum">17</fw> unless I were allowed an opportunity to recruit my health.
               A consultation was held; and at last, not without great difficulties, a boat was
               ordered to row me down to <placeName>Paramaribo</placeName>. Resting on the shoulder
               of <name>a negro</name>, I walked to the water-side, followed by my black boy,

               the dismal spot where I had buried so many brave fellows.</p>
            <p>At two o'clock in the morning I arrived, extremely ill. Having no house of my own, I
               was hospitably received by <persName ref="#marre_0001">Mr. De La Marre</persName>, a
               merchant, who immediately sent for poor <persName ref="#Joanna_0001"
                  >Joanna</persName> to come and attend me. I soon found myself in an elegant,
               well-furnished apartment, encouraged by <name>the physician</name>, caressed by
               friends, and supported by the care and attention of <rs type="person">my incomparable

            <p>My linen had been gnawed to dust by the <ecda:fauna>cockroach</ecda:fauna>, called

               the frightful tidings that the estate of <placeName>Fauconberg</placeName>, with the

               proprietor. I imagined her ensuing dreadful situation. I fancied I saw her insulted,
               tortured, bowing under the weight of her chains, calling aloud for my assistance, and
               calling in vain. Misery almost deprived me of my senses. I was restored, in some
               degree, by the assurances of my friend, <persName ref="#mr_lolkens_0001">Mr.
                  Lolkens</persName>, who providentially was appointed to continue administrator of

               Here the troops were lodged in temporary houses, built with the <ecda:flora>manicore

            <p>"I had the good fortune to recover; but so slowly, that, notwithstanding the great
               care taken of me by that excellent woman, it was <date>the fifteenth of June</date>
               before I was able to walk by myself. Until that time, I was obliged to be carred in a
               species of sedan chair, supported on poles by two negroes. I was fed like an infant;
               being so lame and weak, that I could not raise my hand to my mouth. Poor <persName
                  ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName>, who had suffered so much on my account, was,
               for several days following the <date>twenty-fifth</date>, very ill herself</p>
            <p>"Great was the change from what I had so lately been——the healthiest and happiest of
               morals,——now depressed to the lowest ebb in my constitution and spirits. My friend
                  <persName ref="#Henneman_0001">Henneman</persName>, who visited me constantly,
               told me had had discovered that the medicine, which so nearly killed me, was <seg

               The <rs type="person">surgeon</rs> had measured my constitution by my height, which

            <p>"Being too weak to perform military duty, I surrendered the command to <rs

                  type="person">French planter</rs>, who had given me and <persName
                  ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName> a hearty invitation. At this place I was
               extremely comfortable; and nothing could <pb n="023"/>
               <fw type="pageNum">30</fw> be better calculated for my speedy recovery than this
               gentleman's hospitality and good humor. How inconsistent with all this was his
               severity and injustice to his slaves! <ecda:anonPers>Two young
                  negroes</ecda:anonPers>, that broke into their master's storehouse, and well
               deserved a flogging for their robberies, came off with a few lashes; while
                  <ecda:anonPers>two old ones</ecda:anonPers>, for a trifling dispute, were
               condemned to receive no less than three hundred. When I asked the cause of this
               partiality, <persName ref="#m_cachelieu_0001">M. Cachelieu</persName> answered, that
               the young negroes still had a very good skin, and might do much work; whereas the old
               ones had long been disfigured and worn out, and killing them altogether would be a
               benefit to the estate.</p>
            <p>"After remaining at this plantation nearly two months, we returned to <placeName>The

                  Henneman</persName>, and several others, very ill, without surgeon, medicines, or
               money. I, however, was so carefully attended by <persName ref="#Joanna_0001"
                  >Joanna</persName>, that I had little cause to complain, except that my feet were
               infested with <ecda:fauna>chigoes</ecda:fauna>, a small insect that gets under the

            <p>"<persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName>, with her needle, extracted

            <p>operation without flinching, with the resolution of <seg>an African.</seg></p>
            <p>"I still continued so weak that I almost despaired of recovering perfectly. The

                  >Joanna</persName>'s critical and almost hopeless situation, greatly contributed
               to prevent the restoration of my health. My anxiety was not dimished by hearing that
               the estate <placeName>Fauconberg</placeName> had passed to a new proprietor, a

               friend <persName ref="#mr_lolkens_0001">Mr. Lolkens</persName> had not the smallest
               interest; and that there was in town a general report that we had both been poisoned.
               These tidings were somewhat softened by the kindness of <persName
                  ref="mrs_lolkens_0001">Mrs. Lolkens</persName>, who came to insist that my Joanna
               should accompany her to <placeName>Paramaribo</placeName>, where she should have
               every care and attention her situation required. I thanked her in the best manner I
               was able, and poor <persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName> wept with
               gratitude. Having accompanied them as far as the estate where they dined, I took my
               leave of them and <persName ref="#Joanna_0001">Joanna</persName>, and bade them all
               an affectionate farewell for the present.</p>
            <p>"On my return to <placeName>The Hope</placeName>, I could hardly restrain my
               indignation at the coarse manner in which my messmates rallied me <pb n="025"/>
               <fw type="pageNum">32</fw> concerning my anxiety. '<said>Do as we do, <persName
                     ref="#john_stedman_1744">Stedman</persName></said>, said they: '<said>if our

                  your sighs in your bosom, and your money in your pocket, my boy</said>.' I repeat
               this to show how much my feelings must have been hurt and disgusted with similar
               consolation.</p>
            <p>"I wrote to a <persName>Mr. Seifke</persName> to inquire whether it was not in the

               adjudge. I received for answer, that no money or interest could purchase its freedom,
               unless the proprietor of the mother consented.</p>
            <p>"This infomation completed my misery. I tried to drown reflection in wine; which only

            <p>"No criminal under sentence of death could have received a reprieve with greater joy.
               I returned to <placeName>The Hope</placeName> with the feeling that I might yet be

            <p>On <date>the fourth of December</date> I received tidings that my <persName

                  <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName>, to obtain her manumission; urging despatch,
               because I was uncertain how much longer our troops would remain in

               her myself, had had his canoe upset by the roughness of the water, in the middle of
               the river <placeName>Surinam</placeName>. He was unable to swim, but had the address
               to keep himself in an erect posture. By the buoyancy and resistance of the boat he
               was able to keep his head just above the water, while the weight of his body kept the
               canoe from sinking. In this precarious situation, he was taken up and put ashore by a
               man-of-war's boat, who kept the canoe for their pains. He preserved the letter in his
               mouth, and, being eager to deliver it, accidentally ran into the wrong house; where

               After this, she returned my remaining bond of <measure type="currency">nine hundred

                  >little Johnny</persName>'s immediate manumission. She said it was a necessary

            <p>My uneasiness was not of very long duration. I was one day agreeably surprised by a

               <fw type="pageNum">51</fw> my acquaintance, were left in perpetual slavery, without

               only blamed, but publicly derided me, for what they termed a ridiculous weakness. But
               so extravagant was my joy on this day, at having acted a part the reverse of
                  <name>Inkle to Yarico</name>, that I was half frantic with pleasure. I made my

                  <ecda:fauna>poultry</ecda:fauna>, which had prodigiously increased, to be put
               under their care, for his use; and I waited on a <rs type="person">clergyman</rs> to
               appoint a day for his baptism. To my great surprise, the <rs type="person">Reverend

               replied that the child was under the care of two very proper guardians; but he was
               deaf to my arguments; and I left him, saying, <quote>I preferred <rs type="person">my

                  <fw type="pageNum">53</fw> from a consciousness that she had no right to dispose
                  of herself; secondly, because she had rather be among the first of her own class

            <p>"As she said this, she showed great emotion, but immediately retired to weep in

               fortitude and resignation, I resolved if possible to imitate her example. I calmly
               resigned myself to my fate, and prepared for the painful moment, when my heart
               forbode me we were to separate forever.</p>

                  name, or there is any desire to preserve it for posterity.</p>

               <p>The Poems were originally published in <placeName>London</placeName> in
                     <date>1773</date>. Many of them would do credit to a person of the highest
                  advantages. It would be well to have them always at hand that we may have some
                  conception of the amount of genius which slavery is murdering. The book has a
                  beautiful lithographic likeness.</p>

                  and which continued for six evenings with unabatted interest. The book is enriched
                  by an exceedingly interesting preface of more than 30 pages, by <persName

                  of Mr. Thompson's labors. The whole work gives us a vivid conception of the east
                  and completeness with which Mr. Thompson demolished the extended rampart of
                  slavery, erected with great effort by the hired champion of the slaveholders. The
                  speech in which he cuts up colonization is worth the price of the book.</p>

               <p>This book is a faint reflection of the brilliant light which flashed forth,
                  whenever Mr. Thompson was permitted to speak. The letter from Marblehead to

                  of the Washington st. mob, is one of the most thrilling, spirit-stirring
                  productions which the cause of liberty ever elicited. In addition to much else
                  which is very interesting and valuable, it contains complete and triumphant
                  replies to Mr. Kauffman's absurd story.</p>
