                        reading, and disposed to conduct herself
                        with prudence and integrity. Her character,

                       for the season. Her ladyship was so

                                    what I have so often told you, that nobody

                                   them playing off their unmeaning airs, vying
                                   with one another in the most <emph>obvious</emph>,
                                   and consequently the most ridiculous manner,
                                   so as to expose themselves before the
                                   very men they would attract; chattering,
                                   tittering, and flirting; full of the present
                                   moment, never reflecting upon the future;
                                   quite satisfied if theyg ot a partner at a

                                   for life. I have often asked myself, what
                                   is to become of such <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">girls</ecda:persGroup>, when they
                                   grow old or ugly, or when the public eye
                                   grows tired of them? If they have large 
                                   fortunes, it is all very well; they can afford
                                   to divert themselves for a season or two
                                   without doubt; they are sure to be sought

                     perpetual anxiety about her niece's
                     appearance, manners, and establishment,
                     had completely worn out <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> patience;
                     she had become more insensible to
                     the praises of her personal charms and accomplishments,
                     than young women of her
                     age usually are, because she had been so
                     much flattered and <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">shown off</distinct>, as it is called,
                     by her match-making aunt. Yet <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                     was fond of amusement, and had

                     <fw type="pageNum">8</fw>
                     dices in favour of rank and fashion. Her
                     taste for literature declined in proportion
                     to her intercourse with the fashionable
                     world, as she did not in this society, perceive
                     the least use in the knowledge that 
                     she had acquired. Her mind had never 
                     been roused to much reflection; she had
                     in general acted but as a puppet in the
                     hands of others. To her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_00001">aunt Stanhope</persName>
                     she had hitherto paid unlimited, habitual,
                     blind obedience; but she was more free from affectation
                     and coquetry, than could have been expected,
                     after the course of documenting,
                     which she had gone through. She was 
                     charmed with the idea of her visit to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour</persName>, whom she thought the most
                     agreeable—no, that is too feeble an expression—
                     the most fascinating person she
                     had ever beheld. Such was the light in 
                     which her ladyship appeared, not only to
                     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but to all the world—that is to
                     say, all the world of fashion, and she knew
                     of no other.—The newspapers were full 
                     of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> parties, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>

                     mots: every thing, that her ladyship said,
                     was repeated as witty: every thing, that

                     <fw type="pageNum">9</fw>
                     her ladyship wore, was imitated as fashionable.
                     Female wit sometimes depends on
                     the beauty of it's possessor, for it's reputation;
                     and the reign of beauty is proverbially
                     short, and fashion often capriciously
                     deserts her favourites, even before nature
                     withers their charms. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
                     seemed to be the fortunate exception to
                     these general rules: long after she had
                     lost the bloom of youth, she continued to
                     be admired as a fashionable <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</foreign>; and
                     long after she had ceased to be a novelty
                     in society, her company was courted by 
                     all the gay, the witty, and the gallant.
                     To be seen in public with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
                     to be a visitor at her house, were privileges,
                     of which numbers were vehemently
                     ambitious; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> was congratulated
                     and envied by all her acquaintance, for being admitted as an inmate.
                     Howe could she avoid thinking herself singularly

                     domestic misery.—Abroad, and at home,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was two different persons.
                     Abroad she appeared all life, spirit, and

                     <fw type="pageNum">10</fw>
                     good humour—at home, listless, fretful,
                     and melancholy; she seemed like a spoiled
                     actress off the stage, over stiumlated
                     by applause, and exhausted by the exertions
                     of supporting a fictitious character.
                     —When her house was filled with well-
                     dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights,
                     and resounded with music and dancing,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in the character of the
                     mistres of the revels, shone the soul and
                     spirit of pleasure and frolic—But the moment
                     the company retired, when the
                     music ceased, and the lights were extinguishing,
                     the spell was dissolved.                     
                 </p>
                 <p>She would sometimes walk up and down 
                     the empty magnificent saloon, absorbed in
                     thoughts seemingly of the most painful 
                     nature.

                        his lady never mentioned his name, except

                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> the house, she said—

                    <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> might have been more
                        than a pleasant young man, if he had not
                        been smitten with the desire of being
                        thought superior in every thing, and of
                        beiing the most admired person in all companies.
                        He had been early flattered with
                        the idea that he was a man of genius; and
                        he imagined, that, as such, he was entitled
                        to be imprudent, wild, and eccentric. He
                        affected singularity, in order to establish
                        his claim to genius. He had considerable 
                        literary talents, by which he weas distinguished
                        at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>; but he was so
                        dreadfully afraid of passing for a pedant,
                        that when he came into the company of
                        the idle and the ignorant, he pretended to
                        disdain every species of knowledge. His
                        <ecda:fauna>cameleon</ecda:fauna> character seemed to vary in different
                        lights, and according to the different 
                        situations, in which he happened to
                        be placed. He could be all things to all
                        men—and to all women—He was supposed
                        to be a favourite with the fair sex;
                        and of all his various excellences and defects,
                        there were none, on which he valued
                        himself so much as his gallantry. he
                        was not profligate; he had a strong sense
                        <pb/>
                        <fw type="pageNum">18</fw>
                        of honour, and quick feelings of humanity;
                        but he was so easily led, or rather
                        so easily excited by his companions, and
                        his companions were now of such a sort,
                        that it was probable he would soon become
                        vicious. As to his connexion with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                        Delacour</persName>, he would have started with
                        horror at the idea of disturbing the peace
                        of a family; but in her family, he said,
                        there was not peace to disturb: he was
                        vain of having it seen by the world, that
                        he was distinguished by a lady of her wit
                        and fashion, and he did not think it incumbent 
                        on him to be more scrupulous or
                        more attentive to appearance, than her
                        ladyship. By <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> jealousy
                        he was sometimes provoked, sometimes 
                        amused, and sometimes flattered. He was
                        constantly of all her ladyship's parties, in
                        public and private; consequently he saw
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> almost every day, and every day
                        he saw her with increasing admiration of
                        her beauty, and with increasing dread of
                        being taken in, to marry a niece of <quote rend="quotes">the

                        to be partners in all the speculations,
                        though their names may not appear in the
                        firm. If he had not been prejudiced by
                        the character of her aunt, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>
                        would have thought <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> an undesigning
                        unaffected girl; but now he suspected
                        her of artifice in every word, look, and
                        motion; and even when he felt himself
                        most charmed by her powers of pleasing,
                        he was most inclined to despise her, 
                        for what he thought such premature
                        proficiency in scientific coquetry. He
                        had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond
                        the sphere of her attraction; but
                        frequently, when he found himself within
                        it, he cursed his folly, and drew back
                        with sudden terrour. His manner towards
                        her was so variable and inconsistent, that
                        she knew not how to interpret it's language.
                        Sometimes she fancied, that with
                        all the eloquence of eyes he said, <said><emph>I
                       adore you</emph>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>;</said> at other times she
                        imagined, that his guarded silence meant
                        to warn her, that he was so entangled by
                        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, that he could not extricate
                        himself from her snares. Whenever
                        this last idea struck her, it excited, in the
                        most edifying manner, her indignation 
                        against coquetry in general, and against
                        <pb/>

                        her ladyship's in particular: she became
                        wonderfully clear-sighted to all the improprieties
                        of her ladyship's conduct. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                        newly acquired moral sense was so 
                        much shocked, that she actually wrote
                        a full statement of her observations, and 
                        her scruples to her<persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>, concluding 
                        by a request, that she might not

                        whose character she could not approve,
                        and whose intimacy might prehaps be
                        injurious to her reputation, if not to her

                        in a very guarded style; she rebuked

                        her that her reputation was in no danger;
                        that she hoped no niece of hers would set
                        up for a prude; a character more suspected
                        by men of the world, than even
                        that of a coquette; that the <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0001">person</rs> alluded

                        and her lord, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> should observe,
                        on these dangerous topics, a profound silence,
                        both in her letters and her conversation;
                        tht as long as the lady continued under
                        the protection of <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">her husband</rs>, the world
                        might whisper, but would not speak out;
                        that as to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> own principles,
                        she would be utterly inexcusable, if, after 
                        the education she had received, they
                        could be hurt by any bad examples; that
                        she could not be too cautious in her management 
                        of a man of <rs ref="#clarence_hervey_0001" type="person">―'s</rs> character;
                        that she could have no <emph>serious</emph> cause
                        for jealousy in the quarter she apprehended,
                        as marriage there could not be 
                        the object; and there was such a difference
                        of age, that no permanent influence
                        could probably be oobtained by the lady;
                        that the most certain method for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss

                        of one of the parties, and to the total
                        neglect of the other, would be to betray
                        anxiety or jealousy: that, in short, if she
                        were fool enough to lose her own heart,
                        there would be little chance of her being

                        the artful insinuations of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
                        with respect to her age, &amp;c. and in proportion
                        as her fears subsided, she blamed
                        herself for having written too harshly
                        of her ladyship's conduct. The idea that
                        whilst she appeared as <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> 
                        friend, she ought not to propogate any
                        stories to her disadvantage, operated powerfully
                        upon <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> mind, and she reproached
                        herself for having told, even her 
                        aunt, what she had seen in private. She
                        thought that she had been guilty of treachery,
                        and she wrote again immediately to
                        <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>, to conjure her to burn her
                        last letter, to forget, if possible, it's contents,
                        and to believe, that not a syllable of
                        a similar nature should ever more be heard 
                        from her; she was just concluding with

       </p>
       <p>There was an air of extreme vexation
           in <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> countenance, as she
           pronounced these last words, in which evidently
           more was meant than meat the ear.
           Upon many occasions <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> had
           observed, that <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> exercised despotic
           authority over her mistress; and she had
           seen, with surprise, that a lady, who would
           not yield an iota of power to her <rs ref="#delacour_0002" type="person">her husband</rs>,
           submitted herself to every caprice of the
           most insolent of waiting-women. For some
           time <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> imagined that this submission
           was merely an air, as she had seen
           <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">some other fine ladies</ecda:persGroup> proud of appearing
           to be goverened by a favourite maid; but 
           she was soon convinced that <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
           was in possession of some secret, which
           should for ever remain unknown. This
           idea had occurred to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> more
           than once; but never so forcibly as upon
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">30</fw>
           the present occasion. There had always
           been some mystery about her ladyship's
           toilette; at certain hours doors were bolted,
           and it was impossible for any body but
           <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> to obtain admission. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName>
           at first imagined that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           dreaded the discovery of her cosmetic secrets,
           but her ladyship's rogue was so glaring,
           and her pearl powder was so obvious,
           that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was convinced there must be
           some other cause for this toilette secresy.
           There was a little cabinet beyond her bedchamber,
           which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> called her
           boudoir, to which there was an entrance by
           a back stair-case; but no one ever entered
           there but <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>. One night, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, 
           after dancing with great spirit at a
           ball, at her own house, fainted suddenly:
           <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> attended her to her bed-
           chamber, but <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> begged that her lady
           might be left alone with <emph>her</emph>, and she would
           by no means <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> to follow her
           into the boudoir.—All these things <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
           recollected in the space of a few seconds
           as she stood contemplating <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> and
           the dresses. The hurry of getting ready
           for the masquerade, however, dispelled
           these thoughts, and by the time she was
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">31</fw>
           dressed, the idea of what <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           would think of her appearance was uppermost
           in her mind. She was anxious to

           the character of the comic muse. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady

       <p><said>I protest <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> has made a perfect

       <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> regretted that it was too

        <p><said>Not at all too late, my dear,</said> said
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>; <said>never too late for women
         to change their minds, their dress, or their
         lovers. Seriously, you know, we are to
         call at my friend <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>—she sees
         masks too night—I'm quite intimate there;
         I'll make her let me ste up to her own 
         room, where no soul can interrupt us, and
         there we can change our dresses, and <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
         will know nothing of the matter.
         <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott's</persName> a faithful creature; and very
         fond of me; fond of power too—but who
         is not?—we must all hae our faults—one

         would not quarrel with such a good creature
         as <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> for a trifle.</said> Then suddenly
         changing her tone, she said <said>not a
         human being will find us out at the masquerade;
         for no one but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs Freke</persName> knows 
         that we are two muses. <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>

         to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> own character, so <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>
         will make fine confusion.</said>            
        </p>   
        <p>As soon as they got to <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> immediately
            went up stairs to exchange dresses.
            Poor <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, now she felt herself in
            spirits to undertake the comic muse, was
            rather vexed to be obliged to give up her
            becoming character; but there was no resisting 
            the polite energy of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> 
            vanity. Her ladyship ran as quick as
            lightning into a closet within the dressing-
            room, saying to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName> woman</ecda:anonPers>,
            who attempted to follow with—<said>Can I do
            any thing for your ladyship?</said>—<said>No, No,
            no—nothing, nothing—thank ye, thank

                <fw type="pageNum">33</fw>
            body do any thing for me but <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>;</said>
            and she bolted herself in the closet. In a
            few minutes she half opened the door,
            threw out her tragic robes, and cried,
            <said>Here, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, give me yours—
            quick—and let's see whether comedy or
            tragedy will be ready first.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Lord bless and forgive me,</said> said <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>
        woman</ecda:anonPers>, when <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        at last threw open the door, when she was
        completely dressed—<said>but, if your la'ship
        has not been dressing all this time in that
        den, without any thing in the shape of a
        looking glass—and not to let me help! I
        that should have been so proud.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> put <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">half a guinea</ecda:commodity> into
            the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="maid" a-gender="female">waiting-maid's</ecda:anonPers> hand, laughed affectedly
            at her own <emph>whimsicalities</emph>, and declared,
            that she could always dress herself
            better without a glass than with one. All
            this went off admirably well with every
            body but <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>; she could not
            help thinking it extraordinary, that a person
            who was obviously fond of being waited 
            upon, would never suffer any person to
            assist her at her toilette except <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, a
            woman of whom she was evidently afraid.
            <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour's</persName> quick eye saw curiosity
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">34</fw>
            painted in <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> countenance, and for
            a moment she was embarrassed; but she
            soon recovered herself, and endeavoured to
            turn the course of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman's</persName> thoughts,
            by whispering to her some nonsense about
            <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>—A cabalistical name,
            which she knew had the power, when
            pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing
            <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> into confusion.            
        </p>
        <p>The first person they saw, when they
            went into the drawing-room at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            was this very <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who
            was not in a domino. He had laid a wager
            with <ecda:anonPers>one of his acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, that he could
            perform the part of the <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, such as
            he is seen in <persName ref="#henry_fuseli_1741">Fuseli's</persName> well known picture.
            For this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity
            in the invention and execution of
            a length of coiled skin, which he manœuvred
            with great dexterity, by means of internal
            wires; his grand difficulty had been
            to manufacture the rays that were to come
            from his eyes. He had contrived a set of
            phosphoric rays, which he was certain 
            would charm all the fair <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">daughters of <persName ref="#eve_0001">Eve</persName></ecda:persGroup>.
            He forgot, it seems, that phosphorus could
            not well be seen by candle light. When
            he was just equipped as a <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, his rays
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">35</fw>
            set fire to part of his <mcr rend="italic">italic</mcr>, and it was
            with the greatest difficulty that he was
            extricated. He escaped unhurt, but his
            <ecda:fauna>serpent's</ecda:fauna> skin was utterly consumed; nothing
            remained, but the melancholy spectacle
            of it's skeleton. He was obliged to
            give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade,
            but he resolved to be at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            that he might meet <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> and
            <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>. The moment that
            the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">tragic and comic muse</ecda:persGroup> appeared, he 
            invoked them with much humour and 
            mock pathos, declaring that he knew not
            which of them could best sing his adventure.
            After a recital of his misfortune
            had entertained the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">company</ecda:persGroup>, and after
            the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">muses</ecda:persGroup> had performed their parts to the
            satisfaction of the audience, and their own,
            the conversation ceased to be supported in
            masquerade character; <ecda:persGroup>muses and harlequins,
            gipsies and <name>Cleopatras</name></ecda:persGroup>, began to talk
            of their private acfairs, and of the news
            and the scandal of the day. 
        </p>
        <p>A <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">group of gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>, amongst whom 
            was <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, gathered round the
            tragic muse; as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> had hinted
            that he knew she was a person of distinction,
            though he would not tell her name.
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">36</fw>
            He thought that he could not flatter her 
            ladyship more than by abusing <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>.
            After he had exercised his wit for 
            some time, without obtaining from the
            tragic muse one single syllable, he whispered,
            <said><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>, why this unnatural
            reserve? do you imagine, that, 
            through this tragical disguise, I have not
            found you out?</said>
        </p>
        <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#belinda_portman_0001">tragic muse</rs>, apparently absorbed 
            in meditation, vouchsafed no reply.

        <p><said>The devil a word can you get for your

        instant. <said>Why didn't you stick to t'<rs ref="#delacour_0001" type="person">other

        <p><said>There's danger in flirting,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,
            <said>with an errant flirt of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
            training. There's a kind of electricity
            about that <rs type="person" ref="#belinda_portman_0001">girl</rs>. I have a sort of

        <p><said>Fore-warned is fore-armed,</said> replied
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">his companion</ecda:anonPers>—<said>a man must be a novice

         had she, in the devil's name, to set up 
         with in the world, but a pair of good eyes
         —Her aut, to be sure, taught her the
         use of them early enough—They might
         have rolled to all eternity, before they
         would have rolled me out of my senses;
         but you see, they did <persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache's</persName> business
         —However they are going to part
         now, I hear—<persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache</persName> was tired of her,
         before the honey-moon was over, as I

         <persName ref="#joddrell_0001">Joddrell</persName>, who has no more ear than a

        <p>The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> joined in the general

       </p>      
        <p>The carriage stopped at the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>,
            just as <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0001">her ladyship</rs> came to the words
            <quote><said>love and all that,</said></quote>—her thoughts took a
            different turn, and during the remainder
            of the night she exhibited, in such a manner
            as to attract universal admiration,
            all the ease, and grace, and gayety, of <persName ref="#euphrosyne">Euphrosyne</persName>.

        <p>To <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> the night appeared long
            and dull; the common place wit of <ecda:persGroup>chimney-
            sweepers and gipsies</ecda:persGroup>; the antics of
            <ecda:persGroup>harlequins</ecda:persGroup>; the graces of <ecda:persGroup>flower-girls</ecda:persGroup> and
            <ecda:persGroup><name>Cleopatras</name></ecda:persGroup> had not power to amuse her;
            for her thoughts still recurred to that conversation
            which had given her so much
            pain—a pain which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> raillery
            had failed to obliterate.            
        </p> 
        <p><said>How happy you are, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
           said she, when they got into the carriage
           to go home—<said>How happy you are to
           have such an amazing flow of spirits!</said>—
        </p>   
        <p><said>Amazing you might well say, if you
        knew all,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—and she
         heaved a deep sigh, threw herself back
         in the carriage, let fall her mask, and was 
         silent—It was broad day-light, and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
         had a full view of her countenance,
         which was the picture of despair—She
         uttered not one syllable more, nor had
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> the courage to interrupt her
         meditations, till they came within sight
         of <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>; when <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> ventured
         to remind her, that she had resolved
         to stop there, and change dresses before
         <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> saw them.
        </p>

         Her ladyship sunk back into her former
         attitude; but after she had remained silent
         for some moments, she started up and 
         exclaimed—

        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> astonishment at these words,

         the word <said><quote>dying</quote>!</said>—<said>Yes, dying,</said> said

        <p>Not a word more passed, till they got
         home. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> hurried up stairs,
         bidding <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> follow her to her dressing-
         room. <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was lighting the six

         said <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> to herself, as she fixed her

         <said>I'll be burnt, if I don't make my

        and taking one of the candles from 
        the table, she pressed on hastily with
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, through her dressing-room,
        through her bedchamber, and to the door
        of the mysterious cabinet.           
       </p>  
      <p><said><persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, the key of this door,</said> cried

       </p>      
       <p><said>Heavenly graciousness!</said>, cried <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,

        <p><said>The key—the key—quick, the key,</said>
         repeated <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in a peremptory

            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">52</fw>
          drew it from her pocket, and unlocked the

        <p><said>Had I not best put <emph>the things</emph> to
        rights, my lady?</said> said <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, catching
         fast hold of the opening door.            
        </p>     
        <p><said>I'll ring when you are wanted, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,</said>
         said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>; and pushing
         open the door with violence, she rushed
         forward to the middle of the room, and
         turning back she beckoned to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> to
         follow her—<said>Come in, what is it you are
         afraid of?</said> said she.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> went on,
         and the moment she was in the room,
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> shut and locked the door.
          The room was rather dark, as there was no 
          light in it, except what came from the
          candle, which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> held in her
          hand, and which burned but dimly.—
          <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, as she looked round, saw nothing
          but a confusion of linen rags—vials, some 
          empty, some full, and she perceived that
          there was a strong smell of medicines.
        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>, whose motions were all
        precipitate, like those of a person whose
        mind is in great agitation, looked from 
        side to side of the room, without seeming
        to know what she was in search of. She 
        then, with a species of fury, wiped the
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">53</fw>
        paint from her face, and returning to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
        held the candle so as to throw the
        light full upon her livid features. Her
        eyes were sunk, her cheeks hollow—no
        trace of youth or beauty remained on her
        death-like countenance, which formed a
        horrid contrast with her gay fantastic dress.
        </p>     
       <p><said>You are shocked, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,</said>, said she,
         <said>but as yet you have seen nothing—look
         here,—</said> and baring one half of her bosom,
         she revealed a hideous spectacle.           
       </p>      
       <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> sunk back into a chair—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

       her.          
       </p>      
        <p><said>Am I humbled, am I wretched enough?</said>
         cried she, her voice trembling with agony
         —<said>Yes, pity me, for what you have seen;
         and a thousand times more—my mind is eaten away
         like my body, by incurable disease—inveterate
         remores—remorse for a life of folly
         —of folly which has brought on me all
         the punishments of guilt.</said>
        </p>     
        <p><said><rs ref="#delacour_0002" type="person">My husband</rs>,</said> continued she, and
          her voice suddenly altered from the tone
          of grief to that of anger—<said>My husaband

              <fw type="pageNum">54</fw>
          them—<ecda:persGroup>My own relations</ecda:persGroup> hate me—no
          matter, I never wish to see them more—
          never shall they see my sorrow—never
          shall they hear a complaint, a sigh from
          me. There is no torture which I could
          not more easily endure than their insulting
          pity. I will die, as I have lived, the envy
          and admiration of the world. When I
          am gone, let them find out their mistake;
          and moralise, if they wil, over my grave.</said>
          —She paused—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had no power to
           speak.
        </p>     
        <p><said>Promise, swear to me,</said> resumed <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
        Delacour</persName> vehemently, seizing <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
        hand, <said>that you will never reveal to any
        mortal what you have seen and heard this

        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> is dying by inches, except
        <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, and that woman, who but a

        to whom I trusted every secret of my life,
        every thought of my hear.—Fool! idiot!
        Dupe that I was to trust to the friendship
        of a woman, whom I knew to be without 
        principle—but I thought she had honour;
        I thought she could never betray <emph>me</emph>—O

        would receive my last breath—you to desert
        me!—Now I am alone in the world—
        left to the mercy of an insolent waiting-

        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> hid her face on <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
          lap, and almost stifled by the violence of
          contending emotions, she at last gave vent
          to them, and sobbed aloud.
        </p>     
        <p><said>Trust to one,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, pressing
            her hand with all the tenderness which
            humanity could dictate, <said>who will never
            leave you at the mercy of an insolent waiting
            woman—trust to me.</said>            
        </p>     
        <p><said>Trust to you,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
            looking up eagerly in <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> face;
            <said>Yes—I think—I may trust to you—for

            symptoms of artless feeling about you.
            This was what tempted me to open my

            the only friend—but I will think no more

            <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriot</persName> appeared with a face of constrained

        </p>  
        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, when she was left alone, immediately
            opened her shutters, and threw
            up the sash to refresh herself with the
            morning air. She felt excessively fatigued,
            and in the hurry of her mind, she could
            not think of any thing distinctly. She 
            took off her masquerade dress, and went
            to bed, in hopes of forgetting, for a few
            hours, what she felt indelibly impressed
            upon her imagination. But it was in vain
            that she endeavoured to compose herself
            to sleep; her ideas were in too great and
            painful confusion. For some time, whenever
            she closed her eyes, the face and form
            of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, such as she had just
            beheld them, seemed to haunt her; afterwards, 
            the idea of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and
            the painful recollection of the conversation
            she had overheard, recurred to her; the
            words, <said><quote>do you think I don't know that

            fice and affectation</quote>,</said> were fixed in her 
            memory. She recollected with the utmost 
            minuteness every look of contempt, which
            she had seen in the faces of the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">young
            men</ecda:persGroup>, whilst they spoke of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
            the match-maker. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> mind, however,
            was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect:
            she seemed only to live over again
            the preceding night. At last the strange
            motley figures whish she had seen at the
            masquerade flitted before her eyes, and she
            sunk into an uneasy slumber.

             listened to a moral at the end of a story in
             my life—manners for me, and morals for
             those that like them.—My dear, you will
             be wofully disappointed, if in my story
             you expect any thing like a novel. I once
             heard a general say, that nothing was less
             like a review than a battle; and I can tell
             you, that nothing is more unlike a novel
             than real life. Of all lives, mine has been
             the least romantic. No love in it, but a
             great deal of hate. I was a rich heiress—I
             had, I believe, a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">hundred thousand pounds,
             or more</ecda:commodity>; and twice as many caprices—I
             was handsome and witty—or, to speak
             with that kind of circumlocution which
             is called humility, the world, the partial
             world, thought me a beauty, and a bel-
             esprit.—Having told you my fortune, need
             I add, that I, or it, had <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">lovers</ecda:persGroup> in abundance
             —of all sorts and degrees—not to reckon
             those, it may be presumed, who died of
             concealed passions for me. I had sixteen
             declarations and proposals in form—then

             <fw type="pageNum">63</fw>
             what in the name of wonder, or of common
             sense, which by the by is the greatest 
             of wonders—what in the name of common 
             sense made me marry <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName>?—
             Why, my dear, you,—no not <emph>you</emph>, but any
             girl who is not used to have a parcel of
             admirers, would think it the easiest thing
             in the world to make her choice; but let
             her judge by what she feels when a dexterous
             mercer or linen-draper produces pretty
             thing after pretty thing—and this is so
             becoming, and that will wear for ever—
             as he swears; but then that's so fashionable
             —the novice stands in a charming perplexity,
             and after examining, and doubting,
             and tossing over half the <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">goods</ecda:commodity> in the

             the young lady, in a hurry, pitches
             upon the very ugliest and worst thing that
             she has seen. Just so it was with me and

             I pitched upon <persName ref="#delacour_0002">viscount Delacour</persName>, for my

              the 
              world to a man in his condition. Lozenges are of 
              sovereign use in some complaints. The heiress lozenge
              is a specific in some consumptions. You are surprised 
              that I can laugh and jest about such a melancholy thing
              as my marriage with <persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName>; and so am I,
              especially when I recollect all the circumstances; for
              though I bragged of there being no love in my history,
              there was, when I was a <ecda:fauna>goose</ecda:fauna> or a <ecda:fauna>gosling</ecda:fauna> of about
              eighteen—just your age, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, I think—something
              very like love playing about my heart, or my head.
              There was a certain <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Henry Percival</persName>, a <persName ref="#clarence_hervey">Clarence Hervey</persName>
              of a man—no, he had ten times the sense, begging your

              was, that he had too much sense—he was in love with
              me, but not with my faults; now I, wisely considering
              that my faults were the greatest part of me, insisted
              upon his being in love with my faults. He wouldn't,
              or couldn't—I said wouldn't, he said couldn't. I had
              been used to see the me <ecda:persGroup>men</ecda:persGroup> about me lick the dust at my
              feet, for it was gold dust. <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Percival</persName> made wry faces—
              <persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName> made none. I pointed him out to <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Percival</persName>
              as an example—it was an example he would not follow.
              I was provoked, and I married in hopes of provoking
              the man I loved. The worst of it was, I did not provoke
              hime as much as I expected. Six months afterwards
              I heard of his marriage with a <rs type="person" ref="#anne_percival_0001">very amiable woman</rs>.
              I hate those <soCalled rend="italic">very amiable women</soCalled>. Poor <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Percival</persName>! I
              should have been a very happy woman, I fancy, if I had
              married you—for I believe you were the only man who
              ever really loved me; but all that is over now!—Where
              were we? O, I married my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName>, knowing
              him to be a fool, and believing that, for this reason, I
              should find no trouble in governing him. But what a
              fatal mistake!—a fool, of all animals in creation, is
              the most difficult to govern. We set out in the fashionable
              world with a mutual desire to be as extravagant as
              possible. Strange, that with this similarity of taste we
              could never agree!—strange that this similarity of tatse
              was the cause of our perpetual quarrels! During the
              first year of our marriage, I always had the upper hand
              in these disputes, and the last word; and I was content.

             I thought I should in time break him in.
             —From the specimens you have seen, you
             may guess that I was even then a tolerable
             proficient in the dear art of <mcr rend="italic">self-justification</mcr>
             —I had almost gained my point, just
             broken my lord's heart, when one fair

             <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, that he knew no more how

             who is conceit personified, took mortal
             offence at this; and the devil, who is
             always at hand to turn anger into malice,
             put it into <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort's</persName> head, to put it
             into my lord's head, that the world thought
             —<quote rend="italic"><said direct="false">My lady governed him</said></quote>. My lord
             took fire—They say the <ecda:fauna>torpedo</ecda:fauna>, the 
             coldest of cold creatures, sometimes gives
             out a spark—I suppose, when electrified
             with anger.—The next time that innocent
             I insisted upon my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> doing
             or not doing—I forget which—the most
             reasonable thing in the world, my lord
             turns short round, and answers—<said>My
             <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, I am not a man to be governed
             by a wife</said>—And from that time 
             to this, the words <quote>I am not a man to be 
             governed by a wife</quote>—have been written
             in his obstinate face, as all the world who

              <fw type="pageNum">67</fw>
             can read the human countenance may

             you don't know what it is—I hope you
             never may—to have an obstinate fool for
             a bosom fiend.</p>
             <p>I at first flattered myself, that <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">my
             lord's</rs> was not an inveterate, incurable malady:
             but from his obvious weakness, I
             might have seen that there was no hope;
             for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous
             in proportion to the weakness of the
             patient.—My lord's case was desperate.—
             Kill or cure, was my humane or prudent
             maxim.—I determined to try the <seg ana="#poison">poison 
             of jealousy</seg>, by way of an alternative.—I 
             had long kept it in petto as my ultimate 
             remedy. I fixed upon a proper subject—
             a man with whom I thought that I could
             coquette to all eternity, without any danger
             to myself—a certain <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>—
             as empty a coxcomb as you would wish to
             see.—The world, said I to myself, can
             never be so absurd to suspect <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
             with such a man as this, though
             her lord may, and will, for nothing is too 
             absured for him to believe.—Half my theory
             proved just—that is saying a great deal
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">68</fw>
             for any theory. My lord swallowed the 
             remedy that I had prepared for him, with
             an avidity, and a bonhommie, which it did
             me good to behold—my remedy operated
             beyond my most sanguine expectations.—
             The poor man was cured of his obstinacy,
             and became stark mad with jealousy.—
             THen indeed I had some hopes of him;
             for a madman can be managed, a fool cannot.
             In a month's time, I made him
             quite docile. With a face longer than the
             <rs type="person" ref="#heraclitus_535">weeping philosopher's</rs>, he came to me one
             morning, and assured me, <said direct="false">he would do
             every thing I pleased, provided I would
             consult my own honour, and his, and give

             <p><quote><said>Give up!</said></quote>—I could hardly forbear
             laughing at the expression.—I replied,
             <said direct="false">that as long as my lord treated me with
             becoming respect, I had never in thought
             or deed given him just cause of complaint;
             but that I was not a woman to be insulted,
             or to be kept, as I had hither to been, in 
             leading-strings, by a husband.</said> My lord,                 
             flattered, as I meant he should be with the
             idea, that it was possible he should be
             suspected of keeping a wife in leading-
             strings, fell to making protestations—<said direct="false">he
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">69</fw>
             hoped his future conduct would prove, &amp;c.</said>
             —Upon this hint, I gave the reins to my
             imagination, and full drive I went into a
             fresh career of extravagance; if I were
             checked, it was <quote rend="italic">an insult</quote>, and I began directly
             to talk of <quote rend="italic">leading-strings</quote>. This riduculous
             game I played successfully enough,
             for some time, till at length, though naturally
             rather slow at calculations, he actually
             discovered that if we lived at the rate of
             <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty thousand</measure> a year, and had only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten 
             thousand</measure> a year to spend, we should, in
             due time, have nothing left. This notable
             discovery he communicated to me one
             morning, after a long preamble. When
             he had finished prosing, I agreed, that it 
             was demonstrably just, that he should retrench
             his expenses; but that it was equally
             unjust and impossible, that I could make
             any reformation in my civil list.—That 
             <distinct type="mentioned">economy</distinct> was a word which I had never
             heard of in my life, till I married his lordsip:
             that, upon second recollection, it 
             was true, I had heard of such a thing as 
             national economy; and that it would be 
             a very pretty, though rather hackneyed
             topic of declamation for a maiden speech
             in the <orgName>house of lords</orgName>. I therefore advised
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">70</fw>
             him to reserve all he had to say upon this
             subject for the noble <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="free">lord upon the wool-
             sack</ecda:anonPers>; nay, I very graciously added, that
             upon this condition, I would go to the
             house myself to give his arguments and
             eloquence a fair hearing, and that I would
             do my best to keep myself away.—This
             was all mighty playful and witty; but it 
             happened that my <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName>, who never
             had any great taste for wit, could not this
             unluckily morning at all relish it. Of course
             I grew angry, and reminded him, with an
             indelicacy which his want of generosity
             justified, that an heiress, who had brought
             a hundred thousand pounds into his family,
             had some right to amuse herself, and that
             it was not my fault if elegant amusements
             were more expensive than others.</p>
             <p>Then came a long criminating and recriminating
            chapter. It was, <said direct="false">My lord,
            your <rs type="properAdjective">Newmarket</rs> blunders.</said>—<said direct="false">My lady,
            your cursed <emph>theatricals</emph></said>—<said direct="false">My lord, I have
            surely a right</said>—<said direct="false">and my lady, I have
            surely as good a right.</said>                 
             </p>
          <p>But, my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, however we
              might pay one another, we could not pay
              all the world with words. In short, after
              running through <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">thousands, and tens of 
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">71</fw>
              thousands</ecda:commodity>, we were actually in distress
              for <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>. Then  came selling of lands
              and I don't know what devices, for raising
              <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, according to the mode of <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="lawyer">lawyers</ecda:persGroup>
              and <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="attorney">attorneys</ecda:persGroup>. It was quite indifferent to 
              me how they got <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, provided they
              did get it.—By what art these <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>
              raised <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, I never troubled myself to
              inquire; it might have been the black art,
              for any thing I know to the contrary. So I signed
              all the papers they brought to me; and I
              was mighty well pleased to find, that by so
              easy an expidient as writing <quote rend="quotes"><persName ref="#delacour_0001">T. C. H. 
              Delacour</persName></quote>, I could command money at
              will.—I signed, and signed, till at last I 
              was with all due civility informed that my
              signature was no longer worth a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">farthing</ecda:commodity>;
              and when I came to inquire into the cause
              of this phenomenon, I could no wise understand
              what my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer" a-status="free"><persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour's</persName> lawyer</ecda:anonPers>
              said to me. He was a prig, and I had 
              not patience either to listen to him, or to
              look at him. I sent for an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old uncle</ecda:anonPers> of
              mine, who used to manage all my <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>
              matters before I was married: I put the
              <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> and the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer">lawyer</ecda:anonPers> into a room together
              with their parchments, to fight the matter
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">72</fw>
              out, or to come to a right understanding
              if they could.—The last it seems was quite
              impossible.—In the course of half an hour,
              out comes my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> in such a rage! I
              never shall forget his face—all the bile in
              his body had gotten into it—he had literally 
              no whites to his eyes. <said>My dear
              uncle,</said> said I, <said>What is the matter?—
              Why you are absolutely gold stick in
              waiting.</said>             
          </p>
          <p><said>No matter what I am, child,</said> said the
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers>, <said>I'll tell you what you are with all 
            your wit—a dupe—'tis a shame for a woman
            of your sense to be such a fool, and
            to know nothing of business—and if you
            knew nothing yourself, could you not send
            for me?</said>              
          </p>
         <p><said>I was too ignorant to know that I 
         knew nothing,</said> said I; <choice><sic></sic><corr/></choice>but I will not
         trouble you with all the said Is and said
         hes. I was made to understand, that if 
         <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> were to die the next day, I
         should live a beggar.—Upon this I grew
         serious, as you may imagine. My <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers>
         assured me that I had been grossly imposed
         upon by my lord and his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer">lawyer</ecda:anonPers> ,
         and that I had been swindled out of my 
         senses, and out of my dower. I repeated
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">73</fw>
         all that my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> said, very faithfully, to
         <persName ref="md">lord Delacour</persName>: and all that either he or
         his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer">lawyer</ecda:anonPers> could furnish out by way of
         answer was, that <quote><said direct="false">necessity had no law</said></quote>.
         Necessity, it must be allowed, though it
         might be the mother of law, was never
         with my lord the mother of invention.
         Having now found out that I had a good
         right to complain, I indulged myself in
         it most gloriously. In short, my dear, we
         had a comfortable family quarrel—love
         quarrels are easily made up—but of money
         quarrels there is no end.—From the moment
         these money quarrels commenced,
         I began to hate <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>—before I
         had only despised him—You can have
         no notion to what meanness extravagance
         reduces men.—I have known <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>
         shirk, and look so shabby, and tell
         so many lies to people about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
         guineas</measure>—a <measure ana="#currency #commodity">hundred guineas</measure>! What do I
         say? About <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">five</measure>!—O, my
         dear, I cannot bear the thoughts of it!—
         But I was going on to tell you, that my 
         good <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers>, and all <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">my relations</ecda:persGroup>, quarrelled
         with me for having ruined myself, as 
         they said—but I said, they quarrelled with
         me for fear I should ask them for some of
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">74</fw>
         their <quote rend="quotes" source="#shakespeare_caesar"><hi rend="allcaps">vile trash</hi></quote>.—Accordingly I abused
         and ridiculed them, one and all; and
         for my pains, all my acquaintance said
         that, <said><persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was a woman of a
         vast deal of spirit.</said> 
         </p>
         <p>We were relieved from our money
            embarrassments by the timely death of a
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="free">rich nobleman</ecda:anonPers>, to whose large estate my
            <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> was heir at law. I was intoxicated
            with the idle compliments of all
            my acquaintance, and I endeavoured to
            console myself for misery at home, by
            gayety abroad. Ambitious of pleasing universally,
            I became the worst of slaves—a
            slave to the world.—Not a moment of my
            time was at my own disposal—not one of my
            actions; I may say, not one of my
            thoughts, was my own—I was obliged to
            find things <soCalled rend="quotes">charming</soCalled> every hour, which
            tired me to death: and every day it was
            the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation.
            You wonder to hear me speak
            in this manner, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but one must
            speak the truth sometimes; and this is
            what I have been saying to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>
            continually—continually, for these ten 
            years past. Then why persist in the same
            kind of life, you say?—Why, my dear,
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">75</fw>
            because I could not stop—I was fit for
            this kind of life, and for no other—I could
            not be happy at <emph>home</emph>, for what sort of a
            companion could I have made of <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>?
            By this time he was tired of his 
            <ecda:fauna>horse <name ana="#flora #food">Potato</name></ecda:fauna>, and his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Highflier</name></ecda:fauna>, and
            his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Eclips</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Goliah</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Jenny
            Grey</name></ecda:fauna>, &amp;c. and he had taken to hard
            drinking, which soon turned him, as you
            see, quite into a beast.—I forgot to tell
            you, that I had <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">three children</ecda:persGroup> during the
            first five years of my marriage. The first
            was a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">boy</ecda:anonPers>; he was born dead; and my 
            lord, and all his <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">odious relations</ecda:persGroup>, laid the
            blame upon me; because I would not be
            kept prisoner half a year by an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old mother</ecda:anonPers> 
            of his, a vile <name ref="#cassandra_0001">Cassandra</name>, who was always
            prophesying, that my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">child</ecda:anonPers> would
            not be born alive.—My second child was a
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">girl</ecda:anonPers>, but a poor, dimunitive, sickly thing.
             —It was the fashion at this time for fine
             mothers to suckle their own children—so
             much the worse for the poor brats.—Fine 
             nurses never made fine children. There 
             was a prodigious rout made about the
             matter; a vast deal of sentiment and sympathy,
             and compliments and inquiries; but
             after the novelty was over, I became hear-
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">76</fw>
             tily sick of the business; and at the end
             of about three months my poor <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">child</ecda:anonPers> was
             sick too—I don't much like to think of it
             —it died.—If I had put it out to nurse,
             I should have been thought by my <ecda:persGroup>friends</ecda:persGroup>
             an unnatural mother—but I should have
             saved it's life. I should have bewailed
             the loss of the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">infant</ecda:anonPers> more, if <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed"><persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> 
             relations</ecda:persGroup> and <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">my own</ecda:persGroup> had not made
             such lamentations upon the occasion, that
             I was stunned.—I couldn't or wouldn't
             shed a tear, and I left it to the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old dowager</ecda:anonPers>
             to perform in public, as she wished,
             the part of chief mourner, and to comfort
             herself in private, by lifting up her hands
             and eyes, and railing at me as the most
             insensible of mothers. All this time I
             suffered more than she did; but that is
             what she shall never have the satisfaction 
             of knowing. I determined, that if ever
             I had another child, I would not have the
             barbarity to nurse it myself. Accordingly,
             when my third child, a <rs type="person">girl</rs>, was
             born, I sent it off immediately to the
             country, to a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="nurse">stout, healthy, broad-faced
             nurse</ecda:anonPers>, under whose care it grew and flourished;
             so that at three years old, when it
             was brought back to me, I could scarcely
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">77</fw>
             believe the chubby little thing was my own
             child. The same reasons, which convinced
             me I ought not to nurse my own child,
             determined me <foreign xml:lang="fr">à plus forte raison</foreign>, not to
             undertake it's education. <persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName>
             could not bear the child because it was not
             a boy. The girl was put under the care 
             of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="governess">governess</ecda:anonPers>, who plagued my heart
             out with her airs and tracasseries for
             three or four years; at the end of which
             time, as she turned out to be <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName>
             mistress in form, I was obliged—in 
             form—to beg she would leave my house,
             and I put her pupil in better hands, I
             hope, at a celebrated academy for young
             ladies. There she will, at any rate, be
             better instructed than she could be at 
             home.—I beg your pardon, my dear, for 
             this digression on nursing and schooling,
             but I wanted only to explain to you why
             it was, that when I was weary of the 
             business, I still went on in a course of 
             dissipation. You see I had nothing at 
             home, either in the shape of husband or
             children, to engage my affections. I believe
             it was this <quote rend="quotes" source="#cowper_god">aching void</quote> in my heart,
             which made me, after looking abroad some
             time for a bosom friend, take such a pro-
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">78</fw>
             digious fancy to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>. She was
             just then coming into fashion—she struck
             me the first time I met her, as being
             downright ugly; but there was a wild
             oddity in her countenance which made
             one stare at her, and she was delighted to
             be stared at—especially by me—so we
             were mutually agreeable to each other—I
             as starer, and she as staree. <persName ref="#harriot_freke">Harriot Freke</persName>
             had, without comparison, more assurance
             than any man or woman I ever saw. She
             was downright brass—but of the finest
             kind—<rs type="properAdjective">Corinthian</rs> brass—She was one of
             the first who brought what I call <mcr rend="italic">harum 
             scarum</mcr> manners into fashion. I told you
             that she had assurance—<emph>impudence</emph> I
             should have called it, for no other word is
             strong enough—Such things as I have
             heard <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> say!—You will not
             believe it; but her conversation at first absolutely
             made me, like an old-fashioned
             fool, wish I had a fan to play with. But
             to my astonishment, all this <emph>took</emph> surprisingly
             with a set of fashionable young men.

             —allow me to speak of myself in the style
             in which the newspaper writers talk of me
             —<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour's</persName> sprightly elegance was
             but pal—not to say <emph>faded</emph> pink, compared 
             with the scarlet of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke's</persName> dashing
             audacity. As my rival, she would on certain
             ground have beaten me hollow; it was
             therefore good policy to make her my 
             friend. We joined forces, and nothing
             could stand against us. But I have no
             right to give myself credit for good policy 
             in forming this intimacy; I really followed 
             the dictates of my heart of my imagination.
             There was a frankness in <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName>
             manner, which I mistook for artlessness of
             character. She spoke with such unbounded
             freedom on certain subjects, that I gave
             her credit for unbounded sincerity on all
             subjects. She had the talent for making the
             world believe <emph>that</emph> virtue to be invulnerable
             by nature, which disdained the common
             outworks of art for it's defence. I, 
             amongst other, took it for granted, that
             the woman who could make it her sport to
             <quote source="#pope_lady">touch the brink of all we hate</quote>, must have
             a stronger head than other people.—I

             mistake.—I am persuaded that few can
             touch the brink without tumbling headlong
             down the precipice—Don't apply this, my
             dear, <emph>literally</emph>, to the person of whom we
             were speaking. I am not base enough to
             betray her secrets, however I may have
             been provoked by her treachery. Of her
             character and history you shall hear
             nothing, but what is necessary for my own
             justification. The league of amity between
             us was scarcely ratified, before my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord

             her every word which had passed between

             cause, that I was downright ashamed of
             myself, and purely to prove my innocence,
             I determined, upon the first convenient
             opportunity, to renew my intimacy with
             the colonel. The opportunity which I so
             ardently desired of redeeming my independence,
             was not long wanting.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,

             regiment; he returned with a <seg ana="#injury">would 
             across his forehead, and a black fillet
             which made him look something more
             like a hero, and ten times more like a 
             coxcomb, than ever.</seg>—He was in fashion
             at all events, and amongst other ladies,
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>—odious <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>!
             smiled upon him.—The Colonel, however,
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">82</fw>
             had taste enough to know the difference 
             between smile and smile; he laid himself
             and his <ecda:flora>laurels</ecda:flora> at my feet, and I carried
             him and them about in triumph. Wherever
             I went, especially to <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>,
             envy and scandal joined hands to attack 
             me, and I heard wondering and whispering
             wherever I went. I had no object in view
             but to provoke my husband, therefore conscious
             of the purity of my intentions, it
             was my delight to brave the opinion of the
             wondering world. I gave myself no concern
             about the effect my coquetry might
             have upon the object of this flirtation—
             poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>!—heart, I took it for granted,
             he had none—how should a coxcomb
             come by a heart?—Vanity I knew he
             had in abundance, but this gave me
             no alarm, as I thought that if it should
             ever make him forget himself—I mean
             forget what was due to me—I could, by
             one flash of my wit, strike him to the 
             earth, or blast him for ever. One night
             we had been together at <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>
             —she amongst other good things, kept a
             faro bank—and I am convinced,c hated
             —Be that as it may, I lost an immensity
             of money, and it was my pride to lose

             <fw type="pageNum">83</fw>
             with as much gayety as any body else
             could win; so I was, or appeared to be
             in uncommonly high spirits, and <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
             had his share of my good humour. We
             left <placeName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</placeName> together early; about
             half past one. As the colonel was going
             to hand me to my carrige, a smart-looking
             young man, as I thought, came up
             close to the coach door, and stared me
             full in the face: I was not a woman to be
             disconcerted at such a thing as this, but
             I really was startled when the young fellow
             jumped into the carriage after me: I
             thought he was mad: I had only courage
             enough to scream.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> seized hold
             of the intruder to drag him out, and out 
             he dragged the youth, exclaiming in a
             high tone—<said>What is the meaning of all
             this, sir?—Who the devil are you?—My
             name's <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>:—who the devil are
             you?</said> The answer to this was a convulsion
             of laughter. By the laugh, I knew
             it to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>.—<said>Who am I!
             only a <name>Freke</name>!</said> cried she—<said>shake hands.</said>
             I gave her my hand, into the carriage 
             she sprang, and desired the Colonel to
             follow her: <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> laughed, we all
             laughed, and drove away. <said>Where do

             to-night, and I did—Betted fifty guineas

             <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> was mad with spirits, and so
             noisy and unmanageable, that, as I told
             her, I was sure she was drunk.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
             in his silly way, laughed incessantly, and
             I was so taken up with her oddities, that, 
             for some time, I did not perceive we were
             going the <name>Lord</name> knows where; till, at last,
             when the 'larum of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> voice ceased
             for an instant, I was struck with the strange
             sound of the carriage. <said>Where are we?
             Not upon the stones, I'm sure;</said> said I;
             and putting my head out of the window, I
             saw we were beyond the turnkpike.—<said>The

             said I; and was going to pull the 
             string to stop him, but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> had hold
             of it.—<said>The man is going very right,</said>
             said she, <said>I've told him where to go.—
             Now don't fancy that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> and I are
             going to run away with you.—All this is

             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">85</fw>
             To this I agreed, and laughed for fear
             of being ridiculous.—<said>Guess where you
             are going,</said> said <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>.—I guessed and
             guessed, but could not guess right; and
             my merry companions were infinitely diverted
             with my perplexity and impatience,
             more especially, as I believe, in spite of
             all my efforts I grew rather graver than 
             usual. We went on to the end of <placeName>Sloane-
             street</placeName>, and quite out of town; at last we
             stopped.—It was dark, the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">footman's</ecda:anonPers> flambeau
             was out, I could only just see by the
             lamps, that we were at the door of a lone,
             odd looking house.—The house door
             opened, and an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old woman</ecda:anonPers> appeared with

         of all the mummery of the scene, my dear,

         So as there was no fear of being ridiculous,
         there was no shame, you know, and
         my conscience was quite at ease. <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>
         had no conscience, so she was always

         I may say, without shame!—Well
         my dear, I am in a hurry to have done 
         with all this: though I <quote rend="quotes"><hi rend="italic">doated upon
         folly</hi></quote>, yetI was terrified at the thoughts <!-- quote source? -->
         of any thing worse. The idea of a divorce,
         the public brand of shameful life,
         shocked me, in spite of all my real and all
         my assumed levity. O that I had, at this
         instant, dared to <emph>be myself</emph>! But my fear
         of ridicule was greater than my fear of
         vice.—<said>Bless me, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
         whispered <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>, as we left this 
         house, <said>what can make you in such a 
         desperate hurry to get home?—You gape
         and fidget—one might think you had
         never sat up a night before in your life.—
         I verily believe you are afraid to trust
         yourself with us.—Which of us are you

         afraid of; <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, or me, or <emph>yourself</emph>!</said>
         —There was a tone of contempt in the
         last words, which piqued me to the quick;
         and, however strange it may seem, I was
         now anxious to convince <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> that
         I was not afraid of myself—False shame
         made me act, as if I had no shame—You
         would not suspect me of knowing any
         thing of false shame, but depend upon it,
         my dear, many, who appear to have as
         much assurance as I have, are secretly it's
         slaves.—I moralize, because I am come to
         a part of my story, which I should almost
         be glad to omit—but I promised you, that
         there should be no sinse of omission. It
         was light, but not broad daylight, when
         we got to <placeName>Knightsbridge</placeName>. <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> encouraged,
         for I cannot deny it, by the 
         levity of my manner, was in higher and more familiar
         spirits than I ever saw him.—<persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>
         desired me to set her down at her <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">sister's</ecda:anonPers>   
         who lived in <placeName>Grosvenor Place</placeName>.—I did so,
         and I beg you to believe, that I was in an
         agony to get rid of my colonel at the 
         same time; but you know, I could not,
         before <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>, absolutely say to
         him—<said>Get out!</said>—Indeed, to tell things
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">90</fw>
         as they were, it was scarcely possible to
         guess by my manner, that I was under
         any anxiety—I acted my part so well, or
         so ill.—As <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> jumped out of
         the coach, a <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crowed in the area of

         <said>do you hear the <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crow, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour?</persName>—</said>
         <said>Now it's to be hoped your fear
         of goblins is over—else I would not be
         so cruel, as to leave the pretty dear all
         alone.</said>—<said>All alone,</said> answered I—<said>your
         friend the colonel is much obliged to you
         for making nobody of him.</said>—<said>My friend

         with her bold masculine arms folded upon
         the coach door—<said>My friend the colonel is
         much obliged to me, I'm sure, for remembering  
         what the cunning, or the knowing
         woman told us just now, that you and he are
         —or are to be—one and the same person.
         So when I said I left you alone, I
         was not guilty of a bull, was I?</said>—I had
         the grace to be heartily ashamed of this
         speech, and called out in utter confusion
         —<said>to <placeName>Berkeley Square</placeName>.―But where shall

             <fw type="pageNum">91</fw>  
         question of <said>where shall I set you down,
         colonel?</said> at this instant, because <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>
         gave me such an arch sneering look, as
         much as to say—still afraid of yourself!—
         We drove on—I'm persuaded that the 
         confusion which, in spite of all my efforts,
         broke through my affected levity, encourated 
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was natrually a coxcomb
         and a fool, to believe that I was
         actually his—else he never could have
         been so insolent.—In short, my dearh, before
         we had got through the turnpike gate,
         I was downright obliged to say to him—
         <said>Get out!</said>—which I did with a degree 
         of indignation, that quite astonished him.
         —He muttered something about ladies
         knowing their minds—and I own, though
         I went off with flying colours, I secretly
         blamed myself as much as I did him, and 
         I blamed <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> more than I did either.
         —I sent for her the next day as soon as I 
         could, to consult her. She expressed such
         astonishment, and so much concern, at 
         this catastrophe of our night's frolic, and
         blamed herself with so many oaths, and
         execrated <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> for a coxcomb so much
         to the ease and satisfaction of my conscience,
         that I was confirmed in my good
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">92</fw>
         opinion of her, and indeed felt for her the
         most lively affection and esteem—for observe,
         with me esteem ever followed affection,
         instead of affection following esteem.
         —Wo be to all, who in morals preposterously
         put the cart before the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>!—But
         to proceed with my history—all fashionable
         historians stop to make reflections,
         supposing that no one else can have the 
         sense to make any. My <emph>esteemed</emph> friend
         agreed with me, that it would be best for 
         all parties concerned to hush up this business;
         that as <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was going out of
         town in a few days, to be elected for a
         borough, we should get rid of him in the
         best way possible, without <quote source="#johnson_words">more last
         words</quote>—that he had been punished sufficiently
         on the spot, and that to punish
         twice for the same offence, once in private
         and once in public, would be contrary to
         the laws of <name>Englishmen</name> and <name>Englishwomen</name>,
         and in my case would be contrary to
         the evident dictates of prudence—because
         I could not complain, without calling up
         <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> to call <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> out—This
         I could not do without acknowledging
         that his lordship had been in the right,
         in warning me about his <quote rend="italic">honour and my
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">93</fw>
         own</quote>, which old phrase I dreaded to hear
         for the ninety-ninth time; besides, <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord
         Delacour</persName> was the last man in the world
         I should have chosen for my knight—
         though unluckily he was my lord—Besides,
         all things considered, I thought the
         whole story might not tell so well in the 
         world for me, tell it which way I would
         —We therefore agreed, that it would be
         most expedient to hold our tongues. We 
         took it for granted, that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> would
         hold his, and as for my people, they knew
         nothing, I thought, or if they did, I was
         sure of them. How the thing got abroad,
         I could not at the time conceive, though
         now I am well acquainted with the baseness
         and treachery of the woman I called
         my friend.—The letter was known and
         talked of every where the next day, and
         the story was told especially at the odious
         <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>, with such exaggerations
         as drove me almost mad.—I was
         enraged, inconceivably enraged with <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
         from whom I imagined the reports originated.

          <p>But we think that a duel concerning
           ourselves must be more extraordinary 
           than any other. We hear of men being
           shot in duels about nothing every day,
           so it is really a weakness in me to think

              <fw type="pageNum">97</fw>
           I could hardly stand.—You must know

           was, had some magnanimity, and showed
           it—as some people do from whom it is

            —who—to complete my misery—is
            one of the most respectable women in

            then—to me a spectre of dismay.—But
            as <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> said, certainly such a
            man as poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was a useless being

            by a doating mother.—We should see
            things in a philosophical light if we can.—
            I should not have suffered half as much as

            completely—and I blamed him with all

            <ecda:persGroup>my friends</ecda:persGroup>, I mean my acquaintance,
            to run him down full cry, for having
            fought for me—It was absurd—It was

            combined force of vanity and hatred could
            inspire, I performed, and with success.
            You have but little curiosity, I presume,
            to know how many <measure>hogsheads</measure> of <ecda:food ana="#commodity">port</ecda:food>

            cour</persName> was deified by all <emph>true</emph> patriots—and,
            luckily, a handsome legacy left me for my
            spirit, by an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> who died six weeks
            before the election, enabled us to sustain
            the expence of my apotheosis.—The day
            of election came—<persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> and I
            made our appearance on the hustings,
            dressed in splendid party uniforms; and
            before us, our knights and squires held
            <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">two enormous panniers full of ribands and
            cockades</ecda:commodity>; which we distributed with a
            grace that won all hearts, if not all votes.
            —<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> thought the panniers
            would carry the election; and forthwith
            she sent off an express for a pair of pannier
            twice as large as ours. I took out
            my pencil, and drew a caricature of <quote>the <ecda:fauna>ass</ecda:fauna> 
            and her panniers</quote>: wrote an epigram at
            the bottom of it; and the epigram and
            the caricature were soon in the hands of
            half <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. The verses were as bad
            as impromptus usually are, and the drawing
            was not much better than the writing,
            but the <emph>good will</emph> of the critics supplied
            all my deficiencies; and never was more
            praise bestowed upon the pen of <persName ref="#edmund_burke_1729">Burke</persName>,
            or the pencil of <persName ref="#joshua_reynolds_1723">Reynolds</persName>, than was lavished
            upon me by my honest friends.

             what quantity of praise you please.—
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I hoped and expected,
             was beyond measure enraged at the
             sight of the caricature and epigram.—
             She was, besides being a gamester and
             a politician—what do you think?—an
             excellent shot!—She wished, she said, to
             be a man, that she might be qualified to
             take proper notice of my conduct.—The
             same kind friends who shewed her my 
             epigram, repeated to me her observation
             upon it. <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> was at my elbow,

             think proper to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. I scarcely
             thought her in earnest, till she added,
             that the only way left, now-a-days, for a
             woman to distinguish herself, was by
             spirit; as every thing else was grown
             <said>cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men</said>—
             That she knew <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">one of the cleverest young

             into the bargin, who was just going to
             publish a treatise <title>upon the Propriety
             and Necessity of Female Duelling</title>; and
             that he had demonstrated beyond a possibility
             of doubt, that civilized society could
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">102</fw>
             not exist half a century longer without
             this necessary improvement. I had prodigious 
             deference for the masculine superiority,
             as I thought it, of <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> understanding.
             She was a philosopher, and
             a fine lady—I was only a fine lady—I had
             never fired a pistol in my life; and I was
             a little inclined to cowardice; but <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> 
             offered to bet any wager upon the
             steadiness of my hand, and assured me
             that I should charm all beholder in male
             attire—In short, as my second, if I would
             furnish her with proper credentials, she
             swore she would undertake to furnish me
             with clothes, and pistols, and courage, and
             every thing I wanted.—I sat down to pen
             my challenge. When I was writing it,
             my hand did not tremble <emph>much</emph>—not more
             than my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> always does.
             The challenge was very prettily worded—

             In the evening, <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> and I

              county. I went to the ground in the

             but it would have been better, a hundred 
             times better for me, if I had; I

             not used to priming and loading—my
             pistol was overcharged—when I fired, it
             recoiled, and I received a blow on my

          <p>The pain was nothing at the moment
              compared with what I have since experienced
              —But I will not complain till I

              received the blow, much leisure for lamentation!
              for I had scarcely discharged my
              pistol, when we heard a loud shout on
              the other side of the barn, and a <ecda:persGroup a-aig="english">crowd
              of town's people, country people, and
              haymakers</ecda:persGroup>, came pouring down the lane
              towards us with rakes and pitchforks in
              their hands.—An <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> <ecda:persGroup a-aig="english">mob</ecda:persGroup> is really a
              formidable thing.—<persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriot</persName> had mismanaged
              her business most strangely—she
              had, indeed, spread report of a duel—a

              propriety amongst these rusticks was so
              shocked at the idea of a duel fought by
              women in <emph>men's clothes</emph>, that I verily believe
              they would have thrown us into the

              we had boxed in petticoats—The want of
              these petticoats had nearly proved our destruction,
              or at least our disgrace—a 
              peeress, after being ducked, could never
              have held her head above water again
              with any grace.—The <ecda:persGroup a-aig="english">mob</ecda:persGroup> had just closed

              —duck 'em,—duck 'em—gentle or simple
              —duck 'em—duck 'em</said>—when their attention
              was suddenly turned towards a
              person, who was driving up the lane a

              The person was clad in splendind regimentals,
              and he was armed with a long

              in the midst of the noise, could not without
              difficulty make his voice heard; but at

              his <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> half flying—half hobbling up

              waved a red streamer over the heads of
              his flock—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> shook a pole, from the 
              top of which hung a bladder full of <ecda:flora>beans</ecda:flora>.
              The <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> grunted—the <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> gobbled,
              and the <ecda:persGroup a-aig="english">mob</ecda:persGroup> shoulted—eager for the fame

              with loud acclamations.—The
              <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="soldier" a-aig="french" a-gender="male"><rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> officer</ecda:anonPers> was followed with groans
              and hisses.—So great was the confusion,
              and so great the zeal of the patriots, that
              even the pleasure of ducking the female
              duellists was forgotten in the general enthusiasm.
              —All eyes and hearts were intent

              got several yards ahead of the <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna>,

               <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> represented to the <ecda:persGroup>mob</ecda:persGroup>, that he
               was a prisoner on his parole, and that it 
               would be unlike <name>Englishmen</name>, to insult a
               prisoner.—So he got off without being
               pelted, and they both returned in safety
               to the house of <persName ref="#general_y_0001">General―</persName>, where
               they were to dine, and where they entertained
               a large party of officers with the

           <p><persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName> and I rejoiced in our

               business was now over—but in this we 
               were mistaken. The news of our duel,
               which had spread in the town, raised such
               an uproar as had never been heard, even
               at the noisiest election.—Would you believe
               it? The fate of the election turned
               upon this duel.—The common people,
               one and all, declared, that they would not
               vote either for <persName ref="#luttridge_0002">Mr. Luttridge</persName> or <persName ref="#freke_0002">Mr.

               bring them to reason. With true <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>

           <p>The only thing I had to console me
               for all this, was <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> opinion,

               was charmed with my spirit and grace,
               but he had not leisure at that time to
               attach himself seriously to me, or to any
               thing.—He was then, I guess, about
               nineteen or twenty; he was all vivacity,
               persumption, and paradox; he was enthusiastic
               in support of his opinions, but
               he was at the same time the most candid
               man in the world; for there was no set 
               of tenets which could be called exclusively
               his; he adopted in liberal rotation
               every possible absurdity, and to do him
               justice, defended each in it's turn with the
               most ingenious arguments that could be
               devise,d and with a flow of words which
               charmed the ear if not the sense.—His
               essay on female duelling was a most extraordinary
               performance; it was handed
               about in manuscript till it was worn out,
               he talked of publishing it, and dedicating 
               it to me. However, this scheme, amongst
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">116</fw>
               a million of others, he <emph>talked of</emph>, but never
               put into execution.—Luckily for him,
               many of his follies evaporated in words.—
               I saw but little either of him or his follies
               at this time.—All I knew about him is,
               that after he had lost his bet of a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
               guineas</measure> as a <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver, by his knight
               errantry in rescuing the female duellists
               from a <ecda:persGroup>mob</ecda:persGroup>, he wrote a very charming
               copy of verses upon the occasion; and
               that he was so much provoked by the
               stupidity of <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="soldier">some of his brother officers</ecda:persGroup>,
               who could not understand the verses, that
               he took a disgust to the army, and sold
               his commission. He set out upon a tour
               to the continent, and I returned with <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot
               Freke</persName> to <placeName>London</placeName>, and forgot the existence
               of such a person as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
               for three or four years.—Unless people

               actually present, let them be ever so 
               agreeable or meritorious, we are very apt
               to forget them.—One grows strangely
               selfish by living in the world.—'Tis a
               perfect cure for romantic notions of gratitude,
               and love, and so forth.—If I had
               lived in the country in an old manor

               as the deliverer of my life, &amp;c.
               But in <placeName>London</placeName> one has no time for thinking
               of deliverers. And yet what I did
               with my time I cannot tell you—'Tis
               gone, and no trace left—One day after
               another went, I know not how—Had I
               wept for every day I lost, I'm sure I
               should have cried my eyes out before this
               time.—If I had enjoyed any amusement
               in the midst of this dissipation, it would
               all have been very well; but I declare to
               you in confidence, I have been tired to
               death.—Nothing can be more monotonous

               —I question whether a <ecda:fauna>dray-horse</ecda:fauna>, or a
               <ecda:fauna>horse in a mill</ecda:fauna>, would willingly exchange
               places with one—if they could know as 
               much of the matter as I do.—You are
               surprised at hearing all this from me. My 
               dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, how I envy you!—You are
               not yet tired of every thing.—<mcr rend="italic">The world</mcr>
               has still the gloss of novelty for you—But
               don't expect that can last above a season.
               —My first winter was certainly entertaining
               enough.—One begins with being 
               charmed with the bustle and glare, 
               and what the <name>French</name> call <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">spectacle</foreign>; this is

               <fw type="pageNum">118</fw>
               over, I think, in six months.—I can but
               just recollect having been amused at the
               Theatres, and the Opera, and the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>,
               and <placeName>Ranelagh</placeName>, and all those places,
               for their own sakes.—Soon, very soon we 
               go out to see people, not things.—Then
               we grow tired of seeing people—
               and then we go o out, merely because we
               can't stay at home.—A dismal story, and
               a true one.—Excuse me fore showing you
               the simple truth; well dressed falsehood
               is a personage much more <emph>presentable</emph>.—
               I am now come to an epoch in my history,
               in which there is a dearth of extraordinary
               events—What shall I do?—Shall I
               invent—I would if I could—but I cannot
               —Then I must confess to you, that during
               these last four years I should have died
               of ennui if I had not been kept alive by
               my hatred of <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, and of my
               husband—I don't know which I hate
               most—O, yes I do—I certainly hate <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs.
               Luttridge</persName> the most—for a woman can
               always hate a woman more than she can 
               hate a man, unless she has been in love
               with him—which I never was with poor
               <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>.—Yes! I certainly hate
               <pb/>

               <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> the most—I cannot count
               the number of extravagant things I have
               done on purpose to eclipse her.—We have
               had rival routs, rival concers, rival galas,
               rival theatres—she has cost me more than
               <emph>she's</emph> worth—But then I certainly have
               mortified her once a month at least.—
               My hatred to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, my dear,
               is the remote cause of my love for you
               —for it was the cause of my intimace
               with your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>—<persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
               is really a clever woman, she knows
               how to turn the hatred of all her friends
               and acquaintance to her own advantage.
               —To serve lovers, is a thankless office,
               compared with that of serving <emph>haters</emph>—
               polite haters I mean.—It may be dangerous,
               for aught I know, to interpose in the 
               quarrels of those who hate their neighbours,
               not only with all their souls, but
               with all their strength–the barbarians
               fight it out, kiss, and are friends.—The
               quarrels which never come to blows are
               safer for a go-between; but even these
               are not to be compared to such as never
               come to words—Your true silent hatred is
               that which lasts for ever. The moment it 
               was known that <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> and I had
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">120</fw>
               came to the resolution never to speak to
               one another, your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName> began to
               minister to my hatred so, that she made
               herself quite agreeable. She, one winter,
               gave me notice that my adversary had
               set her heart upon having a magnificent
               entertainment, on a particular day. On 
               that day, I determined, of course, to have
               a rival gala.–<ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> maid</ecda:anonPers> had a
               lover, a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">gardener</ecda:anonPers>, who lived at <placeName>Chelsea</placeName>;
               and the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">gardener</ecda:anonPers> had an <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>, which was
               expected soon to blow. Now, a plant that
               blows but once in a hundred years is
               worth having. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">gardener</ecda:anonPers> intended to
               make a public exhibition of ot; by which
               he expected to gain about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
               guineas</measure>.—Your <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>'s maid</ecda:anonPers> got
               it from him, for me, for <measure ana="#currency #commodity">fifty</measure>; and I had
               it whispered about, that an <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> in full
               blow, would stand in the middle of one of
               <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> supper tables.—The difficulty 
               was to make <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> fix upon
               the very day we wanted; for you know 
               we could not possibly put off the blowing
               of our <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>.—Your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName> managed
               the thing admirably, by m eans of
               a <emph>common friend</emph>, who was not a suspected
               person with the <ecda:persGroup ref="#luttridge_0001 #luttridge_0002"><name>Luttridges</name></ecda:persGroup>—in short, my

               <fw type="pageNum">121</fw>
               dear, I gained my point—every body
               came from <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName> to me, or to
               my <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>.—She had a prodigiously fine
               supper, but scarcely a soul staid with her;
               they all came to see, what could be seen
               but once in a hundred years.—Now, the
               <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>, you know, is of a cumbersome
               height for a supper ornament.—My
               saloon luckily has a dome, and under the
               dome we placed it.—Round the huge
               china vase in which it was planted, we
               placed the most beautiful, or rather the 
               most expensive, <ecda:flora>hot-house plants</ecda:flora> we could 
               procure.—After all, the <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> was an ugly 
               thing—but it answered my purpose—it
               made <persName ref="#luttridg_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I am credibly informed,
               absolutely weep with vexation.—
               I was excessively obliged to your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt
               Stanhope</persName>, and I assured her, that if ever
               it were in my power, she might depend 
               upon my gratitude.—Pray, when you
               write, repeat the same thing to her, and
               tell her, that since she has introduced <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda
               Portman</persName> to me, I am a hundred times
               more obliged to her than ever I was before.
               —But to proceed with my important
               history.—I will not tire you, with fighting 
               over again all my battles, in my seven

               <fw type="pageNum">122</fw>
               years' war with <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>.—I believe
               love is more to your taste than hatred;
               therefore I will go on as fast as possible,
               to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> return from his travels.
               —He was much improved by them;
               or at least I thought so, for he was heard 
               to declare, that after all he had seen in
               <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName>, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> appeared
               to him the most charming woman, <emph>of her
               age</emph>, in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.—The words, <quote rend="quotes">of her age</quote>,
               piqued me, and I spared no pains to make
               him forget them—a stupid man cannot
               readily persuaded out of his senses—
               what he sees, he sees, and neither more
               nor less—but 'tis the easiest thing in the 
               world to catch hold of a man of genius—
               you have nothing to do but appeal from 
               his senses to his imagination; and then
               he sees with the eyes of his imagination,
               and hears with the ears of his imagination;
               and then no matter what the age, beauty,
               or wit of the charmer may be—no matter 
               whether it be <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> or <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda

               and from me—and you don't well know
               which way to look.—You are surprised
               perhaps, after all that passed, all that I 
               felt, and all that I still feel about poor

               —So am I surprised—but habit, fashion,
               the devil, I believe, lead us on—and then,
               <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName> is so obstinate and jealous
               —you can't have forgotten the <emph>polite conversation</emph> 
               that passed one morning at 
               breakfast between his lordship and me,
               about <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>—but neither does
               his lordship know, nor does <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence 
               Hervey</persName> suspect, that my object with him
               is to conceal from the world, what I cannot
               conceal from myself, that I am a dying
               woman.—I am, and I see you think
               me, a strange, weak, inconsistent creature
               —I was intended for something better—
               but now it is too late—a coquette I have 
               lived, and a coquette I shall die—I speak
               frankly to you—let me have the glory of
               leading <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> about with me
               in public for a few months longer, then
               I must quit the stage.—As to love, you
               know with me, that is out of the question;
               all I ask or wish for is admiration.

           <p><said>Oh!—I am, sometimes,</said> resumed she,

             the pistol, I neglected the warning twinges
             that I felt from time to time.—at last
             I was terrified.—<persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was the only

             a physician—that I would not do—I
             could not—I never will consult a physician
             —I would not for the universe have my

             enter into my feelings. Why, my dear, if
             I lose admiration, what have I left?—
             Would you have me live upon pity?—
             Consider, what a dreadful thing it must
             be to me, who have no friends, no family,
             to be confined to a sick room—a sick bed

             not yet—not yet—I have fortitude—I

             tion to me, to act my part in public—and
             bustle, noise, nonsense, if they do not
             amuse, or interest me, yet they stifle reflection
             —may you never know what it is to
             feel remorse!—The idea of that poor
             wretch, <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, whom I actually murdered,
             as much as if I had shot him,

             between eight and nine years since he
             died, and I have lived ever since in a

             do—Conscience! conscience will be heard.
             —Since my health has been weakened, I
             believe I have acquired more conscience
             —I really think that my stupid lord, who

              the sea of folly out of her depth—the tide
              of fashion ebbed, and then she was left
              sticking knee deep in the mud; a ridiculous,
              scandalous figure; I had the courage 
              and foolish good nature to hazard myself

              she gives up her friend.—Well! that I

              every where for <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>—she was to be

             —The widow was dumb—I insisted upon
             knowing the cause of this sudden loss of 
             speech—The widow took me into another

             <persName ref="#freke_0003">Mr. Freke</persName>, the husband.—I was astonished,

             believing that I led his wife, instead of

             enjoyed my astonishment and my rage—
             so I concealed both, with all possible presence
             of mind.—He went on overwhelming

                <fw type="pageNum">130</fw>

             and that he was to follow her early the
             next morning to <placeName>―shire</placeName>.—I broke
             from him, simply wishing him a good
             journey, and as much family piece as 
             his patience merited.—He knows that I
             know his wife's history, and though <emph>she</emph>
             has no shame, he has some.—I had the
             satisfaction to leave him blushing with
             anger, and I supported the character of
             the comic muse a full hour afterward,
             to convince him, that all their combined
             malice would fail to break my spirit—in
             public—what I suffer in private, is known

               in which it was related, excited in
               <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> mind astonishment—pity—admiration
               —and contempt.—Astonishment 
               at her inconsistency—pity for her misfortunes
               —admiration of her talents—and
               contempt for her donduct.—To these emotions
               succeeded the recollection of the
               promise which she had made, not to leave
               her in her last illness at the mercy of an
               insolent attendant. This promise <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
               thought of with terror—she dreaded
               the sight of sufferings which she knew
               must end in death—she dreaded the sight 
               of that affected gaity, and of that real
               levity which so ill became the condition
               of a dying woman.—She trembled at the
               idea of being under the guidance of one
               who was so little able to conduct herself;
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">132</fw>
               and she could not help blaming her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt
               Stanhope</persName> severely, for placing her in such
               a perious situation. It was obvious that
               some of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> histrory must have
               been known to <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
               the more she reflected, was the more surprised  at her aunt's ahving
               chosen such a chaperon for a young woman
               just entering into the world. When
               the understanding is suddenly roused and
               forced to exert itself, what a multitude of
               deductions it makes in a short time.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
               saw things in a new light; and for
               the first time in her life she reasoned for
               herself upon what she saw and felt. It
               is sometimes safer for young people to see,
               than to hear of certain characters. At
               a distance, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had appeared
               to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> the happiest person in
               the world; upon a nearer view, she discovered 
               that her ladyship was one of the 
               most miserable of human beings. To
               have married her niece to such a man as
               <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName>, <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> would have
               thought the most fortunate thing imaginable;
               but it was now obvious to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
               that neither the title of viscountess, nor the 
               pleasure of spending three fortunes, could
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">133</fw>
               ensure felicity. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> confessed,
               that in the midest of the utmost luxury and
               dissipation she had been a constant prey 
               to ennui; that the want of domestic happiness
               could never be supplied by that public 
               admiration, of which she was so ambitious;
               and that the immoderate indulgence
               of her vanity had led her, by inevitable
               steps, into follies and imprudence,
               which had ruined her health, and destroyed
               her peace of mind—<said>If <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
               with all the advantages of wealth, rank,
               wit and beauty, has not been able to 
               make herself happy in this life of fashionable

               <said>why should I follow the same course,
               and expect to be more fortunate?</said>
             </p>     
            <p>It is singular that the very means, which
             <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> had taken to make a fine
                lady of her niece, tended to produce an
                effect diametrically opposite to what might
                have been expected.—The result of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
                reflections upon <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
                history was a resolution to profit by her
                bad example; but this resolution it was
                more easy to form than to keep. Her
                ladyship, where she wished to please or
                to govern, had fascinating manners, and
                <pb/>
                <fw type="pageNum">134</fw>
                could alternately use the sarcastic powers
                of wit, and the fond tone of persuasion,
                to accomplish her purposes. It was <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
                intention, in pursuance of her new
                plans of life, to spend, whilst she remained 
                in <placeName>London</placeName>, as little money as possible
                upon superfluities and dress. She had,
                at her own disposal, only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">100l.</measure> per annum,
                the interest of her fortune; but
                beside this, her aunt, who was desirous
                that she should go to court, and make
                a splendid figure there, had sent her a
                draught on her banker for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred

               —and instead of punishing them, you
               sagely and generously determined to punish
               yourself. Then, to convince this 
               youth that you have not a thought of those
               odious nets and canges, that you have no
               design whatever upon his heart, and that

               hint from him, to change your dress, your
               manners, and your character; and thus to 
               say to him, in as plain terms as possible—
               <said>You see, sir, a word to the wise is enough
               —I understand you disapprove of showy
               dress, and coquetry, and therefore, as I
               dressed and coquetted only to please you,
               now I shall lay aside dress and coquetry,
               since I find that they are not to your taste
               —and I hope, sir, you like my simplicity!</said>
               —Depend upon it, my dear, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
               Harvey</persName> understands simplicity as well as 
               you or I do—All this would be vastly
               well, if he did not know that you overheard
               that conversation; but as he does 
               know it, trust me he will attribute any
               sudden change in your manners and appearance,
               right or wrong, to the motives
               I have mentioned.—So don't, novice as

             to my curse—for he never sees my harp

             his ambition to please her was strongly

          have been at the drawing-room to-day, but
          for a blunder of mine; ready dressed she

          who really made his entrée with very composed
          assurance and grace—He managed
          his hoop with such skill and dexterity,
          that he well deserved the praise of being
          a universal genius. The <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>countess de Pomenars</persName></rs>
          spoke <name>French</name>, and broken <name>English</name>,
          incomparably well; and she made out that
          she was descended from the <name>Pomenars</name> of
           the time of <persName ref="#marie_de_rabutin_chantal_1626">madame de Sevigné</persName>: she said
           that she had in her possession several original
           letters of <persName ref="#marie_de_rabutin_chantal_1626">madame de Sevigneé's</persName>, and
           a lock of <persName ref="#francoise_marguerite_de_sevigne_1646">madame de Grignan's</persName> fine hair. 
       </p> 
       <p><said>I have sometimes fancied—but I believe
       it is only my fancy,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
       <said>that this young lady,</said> turning to

       </p>
       <p><rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>Madame de Pomenars</persName></rs> acknowledged

         that it was flattery in the extreme to
           <persName ref="#francoise_marguerite_de_sevigne_1646">madame de Grignan</persName> to say so.            
       </p> 
     <p><said>It would be a sin, undoubtedly, to

         <fw type="pageNum">146</fw>
     here, without flattery to the living, as you

     you can tell us whether <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">la belle chevelure</foreign>,
     of which <persName ref="#marie_de_rabutin_chantal_1626">madame de Sevigné</persName> talked so
     much, was any thing to be compared to
     my <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>.</said>—As she spoke, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
     before <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was aware of her intentions,
     dextrously let down her beautiful
     tresses—and the <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>countess de Pomenars</persName></rs>
     was so much struck at the sight, that she
     was incapable of paying the necessary
     compliments—<said>Nay, touch it,</said>, said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

     </p>   
    <p>At this dangerous moment her ladyship
     artfully let drop the comb; <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
     suddenly stooped to pick it up, totally

     threw down the music stand with his

     and burst out a laughing.—<persName ref="#boucher_0001">Lady

     could believe her own eyes.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

   <p>Fortunately for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <quote rend="quotes" source="#pope_lock">the glittering

    fine ladies do not now, as in former times,
    carry any such useless implements about

   </p>     
   <p>Such was the modest, graceful dignity
   of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman's</persName> manners, that she
   escaped without even the charge of prudery
   —She retired to her own apartment as
   soon as she could.</p>     
   <p><said>She passes on in <quote source="#milton_comus">unblenched majesty</quote>,</said>
    —said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.   
   </p>     
 <p><said>She really is a charming woman,</said> said 
   <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, in a low voice, to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
   Delacour</persName>, drawing her into a recessed
   window; he in the same low voice continued
   —<said>Could I obtain a private audience
   of a few minutes when your ladyship 
   is at leisure?—I have</said>—<said>I am never

   if you have any thing particular to say to
       <pb/>
       <fw type="pageNum">148</fw>
   me, as I guess you have, by—my skill in 
   human nature—come here to my concert,
   to night, before the rest of the world—wait
   patiently in the music room, and perhaps
   I may grant you a private audience—As
   you had the grace not to call it a <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">téte à
  téte</foreign>—In the mean time, my dear <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>countess de

 our hoops?</said>
 </p>    
     
 <p>In the evening <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was
     in the music room a considerable time
     before <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> appeared; how patiently
     he waited is not known to any one
     but himself.—     
 </p>     
<p><said>Have I not given you time to compose
a charming speech,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
as she entered the room—<said>but make
it as short as you can, unless you wish that
<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> should hear it, for she will
be down stairs in three minutes.</said>
</p>
 <p><said>In one word then, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
 can you, and will you, make my
 peace with <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>—I am much
 concerned about that foolish razor-strop
 dialogue, which she overheard at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady

 </p>    
 <p><said>You are concerned that she overheard
 it—no doubt.</said></p>    
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">149</fw>
 <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, <said>I am
 rejoiced that she overheard it, since it has
 been the means of convincing me of my
  mistake; but I am concerned that I had 
 the presumption and injustice to judge of
 <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> so hastily.—I am convinced,
 that though she is a niece of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>,
 she has dignity of mind, and simplicity 
 of character.—Will you, my dear
 <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, tell her so?</said>     
 </p>
 <p><said>Stay,</said> interrupted <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>;
 <said>let me get it by heart—I should have
 made a terrible bad messenger of the gods
 and goddesses, for I never in my life
 could, like <persName ref="#irish_0001">Iris</persName>, repeat a message in the
 same words in which it was delivered to
 me.—Let me see—<quote><said>Dignity of mind,
 and simplicity of character</said></quote>, was not it?
 May I not say at once <said>my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
 <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> desires me to tell you,

 That single word <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">angel</distinct> is so expressive,
 so comprehensive, so comprehensible, it

 <p><said>No, no,</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, laughing,
    <said>it has not come to <emph>that</emph> with me yet,
    <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, I promise you; but is it not
    it possible to say, that a young lady has 
    dignity of mind, and a simplicity of character,
    without having or suggesting any
    thoughts of marriage?</said>     
 </p>   
 <p><said>You make a most proper, but not
 sufficient emphatic difference between
 having, or suggesting such thoughts,</said>
 said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.—<said>A gentleman
 sometimes finds it for his interest, his 
 honour, or his pleasure, to suggest what 
 he would not for the world promise—I 
 mean perform.</said>    
 </p>   
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">151</fw>
    <p><said>A scoundrel,</said> cried <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
        <said>not a gentleman, may find it for
        his honour, or his interest, of his pleasure,
        to promise what he would not perform—
        but I am not a scoundrel—I never made
        any promise to man or woman, that I did
        not keep faithfully—I am not a swindler
        in love.</said> 
    </p>
    <p><said>And yet,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>you
    would have no scruple to trifle or flatter a
    woman out of her heart.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">Cela est selon!</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> smiling,
        <said>a fiar exchange you know is no
        robbery.–When a fine woman robs me 
        of my heart, surely <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> could
        not expect, that I should make no attempt 
        upon hers.</said>—<said>Is this part of my message
        to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName><sic>?</sic>—
        <said>As your ladyship pleases,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,
        <said>I trust entirely to your ladyship's discretion.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>Why I really have a great deal of
    discretion,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but you
    trust too much to it, when you expect
    that I should execute, both with propriety
    and success, the delicate commission of

        <fw type="pageNum">152</fw>
    tection, that a young gentleman who is a 
    professed admirer of mine, is in love with
    her, but has no toughts, and wishes to 
    suggest no thoughts of marriage.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>In love!</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
        <said>but when did I ever use the expression?
         In speaking of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
         I simply expressed my esteem and ad―</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>No additions,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, 
        <said>content your self with esteem—simply
        —and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> is safe, and you too
        —I presume.—Apropos; pray, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,
        how do your esteem and <emph>admiration</emph> (I 
        may go as far as that, may not I) of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss

        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>?</said>        
    </p>        
        <p><said>Perfectly well,</said> replied <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,
           <said>for all the world must be sensible, that
           <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> is a man of too much
           taste to compare a country novice in wit
           and accomplishments, to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.
           —He might, as men of genius sometimes 
           do, look forward to the idea of
           forming a country novice for a wife.—
           A man must marry some time or other—
           but my hour, thank Heaven, is not come
           yet.</said>            
        </p>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">153</fw>
      <p><said>Thank Heaven!</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, 
          <said>for you know, a married man is lost to
          the world of fashion and gallantry.</said>          
      </p>
       <p><said>No more so, I should hope, than
       a married woman,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>.
        —Here a loud knocking at the door announced

       </p>
        <p><said>Yes, I will make your peace, and you

         another time.</said>
      </p>
      <p><said>Nay, nay, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
         now, now,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, seizing her

      </p>  
      <p><said>Upon condition that you do a little
          job for me—indeed for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—She is to
          go with me to the birthnight—and she
          has often hinted to me, that our <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> are
          shockingly shabby for people of our condition.
          —I know she wishes, that upon 
          such an occasion—her first appearance at
          court, you know—we shoud go in style.
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">154</fw>
          —Now my dear positive <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lord</rs> has <emph>said</emph>, he

          and on which <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, I know,
          has secretly set her heart, as I have openly
          in vain.</said>
      </p>
     <p><said>Your ladyship and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>
     cannot possibly set your hearts on any
     thing in vain—especially on any thing that 
     is in the power of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> to
     procure. Then,</said> added he gallantly, kissing
     her hand, <said>may I thus seal my treaty
     of peace?</said>         
     </p>
    <p><said>What audacity!—don't you see these
    <ecda:persGroup>people</ecda:persGroup> coming in?</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
      and she withdrew her hand, but with no
      great precipitation: she was evidently <quote rend="quotes">at
      this moment, as at all in the past</quote>, neither <!-- quote sourece? -->
      afraid nor ashamed, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey's</persName> devotions
      to her should be paid in public.
      With much address she had satisfied herself 
      as to his views, with respect to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
      She was convinced that he had no
      immediate thoughts of matrimony; but
      that if he were condemned to marry, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
      Portman</persName> would be his wife. As this did
        not interfere with her plans, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        was content.

        Portman</persName> the message about <quote><said>simplicity

        frankly said—            
        </p>        
      <p><said><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, nonwithstanding all this,
      observe, I'm determined to retain <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
      among the number of my public worshippers during my life—which
      you know cannot last long.—After I am 
      gone, my dear, he'll be all your own, and
      of that I give you joy.—Posthumous fame
      is a silly thing, but posthumous jealousy
      detestable.</said>          
      </p>          
    <p>There was one part of the conversation
        between <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> and her ladyship,
        which she, in her great discretion, did not
        immediately repeat to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>—that
        part which related to the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>.—In this
        transaction <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had no farther share,
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">156</fw>
        than having once, when her ladyship had
        the handsome <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> brought for her to
        look at, assented to the opinion, that they
        were the handsomest <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> she ever beheld.
        —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, however gallantly he
        replied to her ladyship, was secretly
        vexed to find that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had so little
        delicacy, as to permit her name to be employed
        in such a manner. He repented
        having used the improper expression of 
        <quote rend="italics">dignity of mind</quote>, and he relapsed into his
        former opinion of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> niece.
        —A <choice><sic>relape</sic><corr>relapse</corr></choice> is always more dangerous
        than the first disease.—He sent home the
        <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, the next day, and
        addressed <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, when he met her, with
        the air of a man of gallantry, who
        thought that his peace had been cheaply
        made.—But in proportion as his manners
        became more familiar, hers grew more
        reserved.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> rallied her upon
        <quote rend="italic">her prudery</quote>, but in vain.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
        seemed to think, that her ladyship had
        not fulfilled her part of the bargain.—<said>Is 
        not <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">smiling</distinct>,</said> said he, <said>the epithet always
        applied to peace—yet I have not been
        able to obtain one smile from <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
        since I have been promised peace.</said>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">157</fw>
        —Embarrassed by <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey's</persName> reproaches,
        and provoked to find <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
        was proof against all her raillery,
        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> grew quite ill-humoured
        towards her. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, unconscious of having
        given any just cause of offence, was
        unmoved; and her lady's embarassment
        increased.—At last, resuming all her
        former appearance of friendship and confidence,
        she suddenly exclaimed, one night
        after she had flattered <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> into high
        spirits—
    </p>            
     <p><said>Do you know, my dear, that I have 
     been so ashamed of myself for this week
     past, that I hardly dared to look you
     in the face.—I am sensible I was downright 
     rude and cross to you one day—and
     ever since I have been penitent; and as
     all penitents are, very stupid and disagreeable,
     I am sure—but tell me you forgive
     my caprice, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> will be
     herself again.</said>         
     </p> 
     <p>It was not difficult to obtain <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> 
         forgiveness.         
     </p> 
     <p><said>Indeed,</said> continued <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
         <said>you are too good—but then, in my own
         justification I must say, that I have more
         things to make me ill-humoured than
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">158</fw>
         most people have.—Now, my dear, that
         most obstinate of human beings, <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>,
         has reduced me to the most terrible
         situation—I have made <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
         buy a pair of <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>, and I 
         cannot make my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> pay for
         them—but I forgot to tell you, that I took
         your name—not in vain indeed—in this
         business.—I told <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, that upon condition
         he would do this <emph>job</emph> for me, you
         would forgive him for all his sins, and
         nay, my dear, why do you look as if I had
         stabbed you to the heart—after all, I only 
         drew upon your pretty mought for a few
         smiles—Pray let me see whether it has actually
         forgotten <emph>how</emph> to smile.</said>    
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was too much vexed at this
         instant to understand raillery.—She was
         inspired by anger with unwonted courage,
         and losing all fear of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> wit,
         she very seriously expostulated with her
         ladyship upon having thus used her name
         without her consent or knowledge. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
         felt sure she was now in danger of being
         led into a situation, which might be fatal
         to her reputation and her happiness; and
         she was the more surprised at her ladyship,
         when she recollected the history she
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">159</fw>
         had so lately heard of <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> and
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>. 
     </p>    
     <p><said>You cannot but be sensible, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
     said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>that after the contempt
     I have heard <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> express
     for match-making with <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female"><persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> 
     nieces</ecda:persGroup>, I should degrade myself by any
     attempts to attract his attention.—No wit,
     no eloquence, can change my opinion
     upon this subject—I cannot endure contempt.</said>         
     </p>
     <p><said>Very likely—no doubt</said>—interrupted
      <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but if you would only
      open your eyes, which heroines make it a
      principle never to do—or else there would 
      be an end of the novel—if you would only
      open your eyes, you would see that this
      man is in love with you; and whilst you
      are is afraid of his contempt, he is a hundred
      times more afraid of yours; and as long
      as you are each of you in such a fear of you
      know not what—you must excuse me if 
      I indulge myself in a little wholesome
      raillery.</said>—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> smiled—<said>There now,
      one such smile as that for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
      and I am out of debt and danger,</said>
      said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.         
     </p>
     <p><said>O, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, why, why will you
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">160</fw>
     try your power over me in this manner?</said>
     said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—<said>You know that I ought
     not to be persuaded to do what I am conscious
     is wrong.—But a few days ago you
     told me yourself, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> is—is
     not a marrying man; and a woman of 
     your penetration must see that—that he 
     only means to flirt with me.—I am not a
     match for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> in any respect.—
     He is a man of wit and gallantry—I am
     unpractised in the ways of the world.—I
     was not educated by my <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>—
     I have only been with her a few years—
     I wish I had never been with her in my 
     life.</said>         
     </p>
    <p><said>I'll take care <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> shall know
    that,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but in the
    mean time, I do think any fair appraiser
    of delicate distresses would decide, that I
    am, all the circumstances considered, more
    to be pitied at this present moment than
    you are.—For the catastrophe of the business
    evidently is, that I must pay <measure  ana="#commodity #currency">two 
    hundred guineas</measure> for the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> some how
     or other.</said>
   <said>I can pay for them,</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
     <said>and will with the greatest pleasure.
     —I will not go to the birthnight—
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">161</fw>
     my dress is not bespoke.—Will <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred
     guineas</measure> pay for the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>?—O, take
     the money—pay <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
     Delacour</persName>, and it will all be right.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>You are a charming girl,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
    Delacour</persName>, embracing her, <said>but how can
    I answer for it to my conscience, or to
    your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>, if you don't appear
    on the birthnight?—That cannot be, my
    dear; besides, you know <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> will
    send home your drawing-room dress today,
    and it would be so foolish to be presented
    for nothing—not to go to the birthnight
    afterwards.—If you say <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">a</distinct> you must
    say <distinct rend="italic" type="mentioned">b</distinct>.</said>        
    </p>     
       <p><said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>I will not go
       to the drawing-room.</said>—<said>Not go, my
       dear! What, throw away <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure> for 
       nothing! Really I never saw any one so
       lavish of her money, and so economic of
       her smiles.</said>          
       </p>   
       <p><said>Surely,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, <said>it is
        better for me to throw away <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure>, 
       poor as I am, than to hazard the happiness
       of my life.—Your ladyship knows
       that if I say <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">a</distinct> to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, I must say
       <distinct rend="italic" type="mentioned">b</distinct>.—No, no, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—here
       is the draught for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred guineas</measure>—
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">162</fw>
       pay <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, for Heaven's sake, and
       there is an end of the business.</said> 
       </p>   
       <p><said>What a positive child it is!—Well,
       then it shall not be forced to say the a, b,
       c, of <persName ref="#cupid_0001">Cupid's</persName> alphabet, to that terrible pedagogue
       <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, till it pleases—
       but seriously, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, I am concerned
       that you will make me take this
       draught.—It is absolutely robbing you.—
       But <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> the person you must
       blame—it is all his obstinacy—having
       once said he would not pay for the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>,
       he would see them and me and the whole
       human race expire, before he would change
       his silly mind.—Next month I shall have
       it in my power, my dear, to repay you,
       with a thousand thanks—and in a few 
       months more we shall have another birthday,
       and a new star shall appear in the
       firmament of fashion, and it shall be called
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—In the mean time, my dear
       upon second thoughts, perhaps we can get
       <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> to dispose of your drawing-
       room dress to some person of taste, and
       you may keep your <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure> for the
       next occasion.—I'll see what can be done
       —adieu, a thousand thanks, silly child as
       you are.</said>

               What you can mean by principles and
               delicacy, I own I don't pretend to understand,

              the advice so artfully given to her in this
              epistle, was yet extremely concerned to
              find, that she had incurred the displeasure
              of an aunt to whom she thought herself
              under obligations. She resolved to lay by
              as much as she possibly could, from the
              interest of her fortune, and to repay the
              <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred guineas</measure> to <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>:
              she was conscious that she had no right to
              lend this money to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, if her
              aunt had expressly desired that she should
              spend it only on her court dress; but this
              had not distinctly been expressed, when
              <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> had sent her niece the draughts.
              That lady was in the habit of speaking and
              writing ambiguously, so that even those 
              who knew her best, were frequently in
              doubut how to interpret her words. Yet
              she was extremely displeased when her
              hints, and her half-expressed wishes, were
              not understood.—Beside the concern she
              felt from the thoughts of having displeased
              her aunt, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was both vexed and
              mortified, to perceive that in <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

              not the change which she had expected

              proaching her for her caprice in having given

              spoke, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> attributed to her ladyship's
              desire that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> should not

              the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity> to pay him for the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #sale">horses</ecda:fauna>.
              <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> thought that this was a species
              of mean pride; but she made it a point
              to keep her ladyship's secret—she therefore
              slightly answered <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, <said direct="false">that
              she wondered that a man, who is so well

              be surprised at any instance of caprice
              from a woman.</said> The conversation then
              took another turn, and whilst they were
              talking of indifferent subjects, in came

              was almost as great at this instant,

          and told the whole affair with that peculiar

          was as favourable an auditor at
          this time as she could possibly have found, 
          for no human being could value <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>
          less than he did, and all sense of her

           anxious that they should not penetrate

           that kind of rattling gayety, which always
           delighted his companions, who were ever
           in want of some one to set their stagnant

          Among his other accomplishments
          our hero piqued himself upon the exquisite
          accuracy of his organs of taste. He 
          neither loved <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, nor was he fond of

          gave himself the airs of a connoisseur, and
          asserted superiority even in judging of
          <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>sauces</ecda:food>. Having gained immortal
          honour at an entertainment, by gravely

         he was with the applauses of the <ecda:persGroup>company</ecda:persGroup>,
         to assert, that no man in <placeName>England</placeName>
         had a more correct taste than himself.—
         <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip Baddely</persName> could not passively submit

         yet he would defy him as a connoisseur

         <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName> was chosen as the common

          with affected gravity; and they delivered

                 healthy, rosy, intelligent faces towards the
                 door, the moment that they heard their

                  much struck with the expression of happiness 
                  in <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne's</persName> countenance, that
                  he absolutely forgot to compare her beauty
                  with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>. Whether her eyes
                  were large or small, blue or hazle, he could
                  not tell; nay, he might have been puzzled
                  if he had been asked the colour of her hair.
                  —Whether she was handsome by the 
                  rules of art, he knew not; but he felt that
                  she had the essential charm of beauty, the
                  poewr of prepossessing the heart immediately
                  in her favour. The effect of her 
                  manners, like that of her beauty, was rather
                  to be felt than described. Every

                  body was at ease in her company, and
                  none thought themselves called upon to
                  admire her.—To <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who had

                  <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, this respite from the fatigue
                  of admiration was peculiarly agreeable.
                  The unconstrained cheerfulness of
                  <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival</persName> spoke of a mind at ease,
                  and immediately imparted happiness by
                  exacting sympathy; but in <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
                  wit and gayety there was an appearance
                  of art and effort, which often destroyed
                  the pleasure that she wished to
                  communicate.—Some people may admire, 
                  but none can sympathise with affectation.
                  —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> was, perhaps, unusually
                  disposed to reflection, by having 
                  just escaped from drowning; for he made
                  all these comparisons, and came to this 
                  conclusion, with the accuracy of a meta-
                  physician, who has been accustomed to
                  study cause and effect—indeed there was
                  no species of knowledge for which he had

              <p>The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">children</ecda:persGroup> at <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival's</persName> happened

                  X―</persName>, who was a general favourite with
                  the younger, as well as with the elder part
                  of the family, was seized upon the moment
                  he entered the room: a pretty little
                  <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">girl</ecda:anonPers> of five years old took him prisoner by
                  the flap of the coat, whist <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">two of her brothers</ecda:persGroup>
                  assailed him with questions about 
                  the ears, eyes, and fins of <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna>. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">One of
                  the little boys</ecda:anonPers> fillipped the glass globe, and
                  observed, that the <ecda:fauna>fish</ecda:fauna> immediately came
                  to the surface of the water, and seemed to
                  hear the noise very quickly; but his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">brother</ecda:anonPers>
                  doubted, whether the <ecda:fauna>fish</ecda:fauna> heard the
                  noise, and remarked, that they might be
                  disturbed by seeing or feeling the motion
                  of the water, when the glass was 
                  struck.
              </p>  
               <p><persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> observed, that this was a
                   very learned dispute, and that the question
                   had been discussed by no less a person
                   than the <persName ref="#jean_antoine_nollet_1700">abbé Nollet</persName>; and he related some
                   of the ingenious experiments tried by that
                   gentleman, to decide, whether <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna> can
                   or cannot hear.—Whilst the doctor was 
                   speaking, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was struck
                   with the intelligent countenance of one of

                   <fw type="pageNum">194</fw>
                   twelve years old; he was surprised to discover
                   in her features, though not in their 
                   expression, a singular resemblance to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                   Delacour</persName>. He remarked this to <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>,
                   and the child, who overheard him,
                   blushed as red as scarlet.—Dinner was
                   announced at this instant, and <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
                   Hervey</persName> thought no more of the circumstance,
                   attributing the girl's blush to confusion
                   at being looked at so earnestly.—
                   <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">One of the little boys</ecda:anonPers> whispered as they

                   us as the <rs type="person" ref="#philip_baddely_0001">other man</rs> did.</said>—The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">children</ecda:persGroup>
                   agreed that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> certainly was

                   in his power, endeavoured to show
                   his gratitude, and to cultivate a friendship
                   which had been thus auspiciously commenced.
                   —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, who piqued himself
                   upon being able always to suit his
                   conversation to his companions, distinguished
                   himself at dinner by an account

                   of the <ecda:fauna><rs type="properAdjective">Chinese</rs> fishing-bird</ecda:fauna>, from which

                   Cossacks</name>. From modern he went to ancient
                   <ecda:fauna>fish</ecda:fauna>, and he talked of that which was
                   so much admired by the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> epicures
                   for exhibiting a succession of beautiful
                   colours whilst it is dying; and which was,
                   upon that account, always suffered to die
                   in the presence of the guests, as part of
                   the entertainment.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> was led on
                   by the questions of the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">children</ecda:persGroup> from
                   <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna> to <ecda:fauna>birds</ecda:fauna>; he spoke of the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs>

                   going on to <ecda:fauna>beasts</ecda:fauna>, when he was nearly 
                   struck dumb by the forbidding severity,

                   to him, fixed her eyes upon him.—He
                   had not, till this instant, paid the smallest
                   attention to her; but her stern countenance
                   was now so strongly contrasted with
                   the approving looks of the children who
                   sat next to her, that he could not help
                   remarking it.—He asked her to do him

                   the honour to drink a glass of <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food> with
                   him—She declined doing him that honour;
                   observing that she never drank more than
                   one glass of <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food> at dinner, and that she
                   had just taken one with <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>.—
                   Her manner was well-bred, but haughty
                   in the extreme; and she was so passionate,
                   that her anger sometimes conquered even
                   her politeness. Her dislike to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

                   <ecda:fauna>beasts</ecda:fauna>. The <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">boy</ecda:anonPers>, who sat next to him, had
                   asked some questions about the proboscis
                   of the <ecda:fauna>elephant</ecda:fauna>, and <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> mentioned

                   <placeName>India</placeName>, who have been set to watch young

                   with their trunks, when they go out of
                   bounds. He talked next of the <ecda:fauna>unicorn</ecda:fauna>;
                   and addressing himself to <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> and
                   <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>, he declared that in his

          probably should never have been acquainted

          my little <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>—About the time that
          the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old gardener</ecda:anonPers> was left a begger, as I
          happened to be walking out one fine evening
          in <placeName>Sloane-street</placeName>, I met a procession of
          <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" a-occupation="student">school girls</ecda:persGroup>—an <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> begged from 
          them in a most moving voice; and as they
          passed, several of the <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="student" a-gender="female">young ladies</ecda:persGroup> threw
          <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">halfpence</ecda:commodity> to him.—One little girl, who
          observed that the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> could not stoop
          without great difficulty, staid behind the

          <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers>, and put them into his had.—He
          began to tell his story over again to her,
          and she stayed so long listening to it, that
          her <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" a-occupation="student">companions</ecda:persGroup> had turned the corner of
          the street, and were out of sight.—She
          looked about in great distress; and I never
          shall forget the pathetic voice with which
          she said, <said>O what will become of me?
           every body will be angry with me?</said>—I
          assured her that nobody should be angry

              <fw type="pageNum">210</fw>
          with her, and she gave me her little hand

          took her home to her <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="schoolmistress">schoolmistress</ecda:anonPers>, and
          I was so pleased with the beginning of
          this acquaintance, that I was determined
          to cultivate it.—One good acquaintance I
          have heard always leads to another.—<persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>
          introduced me to her <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">aunt Delacour</persName>,
          as her best friend.—<persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName>
          has the goodness to let her little

          has grown into friendship.—<persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>
          has become quite one of my family.</said>
          </p>

          <said>her spirits were quite broken by her <rs ref="#delacour_0001" type="person">mother's</rs>
          neglect of her—young as she is, she

          </p>    
          <p>At the recollection of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
            neglect of her child, <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName> was

         You know, <persName ref="#francesco_petrarch_1304">Petrarch</persName> tells us, he would
         not have been happy if he could; he
         would not have married his <persName ref="#laura_0001">mistress</persName> if it
         had been in his power; because, then
         there would have been an end of his 
         beautiful sonnets.</said>

         <p><said>Every one to his taste,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>;
             <said>for my part, I have even less ambition

         for introducing to her a gentleman
         with whom she had long desired to converse.
         <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> had a great literary

         ration. She perceived also that he had
         considerable influence with <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
         and this was sufficient reason to
         make her wish for his good opinion. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
         was particularly pleased with his
         manners and conversation; she saw that
         he paid her much attention, and she was 
         desirous that he should think favourably
         of her; but she had the good sense and
         good taste to avoid a display of her abilities
         and accomplishments. A sensible man,
         who has any knowledge of the world and
         talents for conversation, can easily draw
         out the knowledge of those with whom
         he converses. <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> possessed this

            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">220</fw>
        course of a single morning visit. Women, 
        you know, as well as men, often speak
        with one species of enthusiasm, and act
        with another.—I must see your <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
        act—I must study her, before I can
        give you my final judgment.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
        has honoured me with her commands
        to go to her as often as possible.
        For your sake, my dear <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>, I shall
        obey her ladyship most punctually, that I
        may have frequent opportunities of seeing

        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> expressed his gratitude with
         much energy, for this instance of the
         doctor's friendship. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, who had
         been entertained by <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―'s</persName> conversation
         during this first visit, was more
         and more delighted with his understanding
         and character. She felt that
         he unfolded her powers, and that with the
         greatest politeness and address he raised
         her confidence in herself, without ever
         descending to flattery. By degrees <supplied reason="flawedReproduction">s</supplied>he
         learned to look upon him as a friend;
         she imparted to him with great ingenuousness
         her opinions on various subjects
         and she was both amused and instructed
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">221</fw>
         by his observations on the characters and
         manners of the company who frequented
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> assemblies. She did not
         judge of the doctor's sincerity merely by
         the kindness he showed her, but by his 
         conduct towards others.
        </p>
        <p>One night, at a select party at <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
           a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-aig="spanish"><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> gentleman</ecda:anonPers> was amusing
           the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">company</ecda:persGroup> with some anecdotes, to
           prove the extraordinary passions which
           some of his countrymen formerly showed
           for the game of chess. He mentioned families,
           in which unfinished games, bequeathed
           by will, had descended from father
           to son, and where victory was doubtful 
           for upwards of a century.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> observed, that gaining a
            battle was, at that time, so common to the 
            court of <placeName>Spain</placeName>, that a victory at chess
            seemed to confer more eclat; for that an
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="abbe" a-religion="catholic">abbé</ecda:anonPers>, by losing adroitly a game at chess
            to the <ecda:anonPers a-aig="spanish" a-occupation="minister"><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> minister</ecda:anonPers>, obtained a cardinal's
            hat.            
        </p>
        <p>The <ecda:anonPers a-aig="spanish" a-gender="male">foreigner</ecda:anonPers> was flattered by the manner
            in which <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName> introduced this slight
            circumstance, and he directed to him his
            conversation, speaking in <name>French</name> and
            <name>Italian</name> successively; he was sufficiently
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">222</fw>
            skilled in both languages, but <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> 
            spoke them better. Till he appeared,
            the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-aig="spanish">foreigner</ecda:anonPers> was the principal object of 
            attention, but he was soon eclipsed by
            <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Nothing amusing or instructive
            that could be said upon the game 
            of chess escaped him, and the literary
            ground, which the slow don would have
            taken some hours to go regularly over,
            our hero traversed in a few minutes.—

            all that could adorn his course from <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs>

        </p>
        <p>By this display of knowledge he surprised
            even his friend <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>. The
            ladies admired his taste as a poet, the
            gentlemen his accuracy as a critic; <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

            silently approved.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> was elated.

            <title ref="#vida_sacchia">Sacchia</title>, asked him if he were as perfect
            in the practice as in the theory of the game
            of chess. <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> was too proud of excelling

         his presence of mind, and convinced him
         that he was not a man to be despised.
         The combat was long doubtful, but at
         length, to the surprise of all present, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

        <p>Exulting in his success he looked round
            for <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, from whom he expected
            the honours of his triumph.—She
            had left the room, but soon she returned,
            dressed in the character of <persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">Queen Elizabeth</persName>,
            in which she had once appeared at
            a masquerade, with a large ruff, and all
            the costume of the times.

        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, throwing himself at

        <p>Soon the coquetry of the queen entirely
            conquered her prudery; and the favoured
            courtier, evidently elated by his situation,
            was as enthusiastic as her majesty's most
            insatiable vanity could desire. The characters
            were well supported; both the 
            actor and actress were highly animated,
            and seemed so fully possessed by their 
            parts, as to be insensible to the comments
            that were made on the scene. <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

            the deep blush which he saw on <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
            cheek, when <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0001"><persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">queen Elizabeth</persName></rs> addressed
            her as one of her maids of honour, of

            conscious that he had been hurried by the
            enthusiasm of the moment farther than he
            either wished or intended. It was difficult
            to recede, when her majesty seemed
            disposed to advance; but <rs ref="#clarence_hervey_0001" type="person"><persName ref="#walter_raleigh_1554">sir Walter

        —She has, it is true, an antipathy to me,

          <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>, I cannot tell you

         the injustice of predetermining to detest
         <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>; merely because she had shown
         kindness to <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>, and because she bore
         a high character.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> was a

            <fw type="pageNum">241</fw>
         who listened to it only that she might

        Of what use could even the wisdom of

            <fw type="pageNum">242</fw>
        —whilst I yet live I must <emph>keep it up</emph> with

           her countenance as she spoke.—She turned

        <p>At this moment <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who
            had no suspicion that the gay, brilliant
            <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was sinking into the grave,
            had formed a design worthy of his ardent
            and benevolent character.—The manner
            in which her ladysip had spoken of his
            friend <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, the sigh which she
            gave at the reflection, that she might have

            early had a sensible friend, made a great
            impression upon <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Till then,
            he had merely considered her ladyship as
            an object of amusement, and introduction
            to high life; but he now felt so much
            interested for her, that he determined to
            exert all his influence to promote her happiness.
            —He knew <emph>that</emph> influence to be
            considerable—not that he was either coxcomb,
            or dupe enough, to imagine that
            <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was in love with him: he

            solved to show her, that it could no longer
            be secured without deserving his esteem.
            —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was a thoroughly generous
            young man: capable of making
            the greatest sacrifices, when encouraged

            to postpone the declration of his attachment
            to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, that he might devote
            himself entirely to his new project. His
            plan was to wean <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, by degrees,
            from dissipation, by attaching her
            to her daughter, and to <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival</persName>.
            He was sanguine in all his hopes,
            and rapid, but not unthinking, in all his
            decisions.—From <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> he went
            immediately to <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, to whom he
            communicated his designs.
        </p>
        <p><said>I applaud your benevolent intentions,</said>
           said the <rs type="person" ref="rx">doctor</rs>, <said>but have you really the
           presumption to hope, that an ingenuous
           young man of five and twenty can reform

        </p>
        <p><said><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> is not yet thirty,</said> said
            <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>; <said>but the older she is, the better
            the chance of her giving up a losing game.
            —She has an admirable understanding,
            and she will soon—I mean as soon as she

            trust to you.—Do you prepare <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>
            to tolerate <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> faults, and I

         the address with which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

         quickly discovered, that hatred of
         <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridges</persName> was her ruling passion.
         Above nine years of continual warfare had
         exasperated the tempers of both parties,
         and no opportunities of manifesting their
         mutual antipathy were ever neglected.
         Extravagantly as <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> loved admiration,
         the highest possible degree of

          enjoyed the full exultation of vanity;

        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, after her ladyship's departure,

         that she was surprised when she heard the

        <p><said>Is it possible,</said> thought she, <said>that

        —How different are my feelings

        should then have thought the loss of a

        It is singular, that my having spent a

        <choice><sic>woman</sic><corr>women</corr></choice> in <placeName>England</placeName> should have sobered
        my mind so completely. I f I had never

        might have misled me to the end

        the life of a fine lady would never make 
        me happy.—<persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> told me, the

        <p>The idea of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was so

         separate them in her imagination—and
         she was just beginning to reflect upon the
         manner in which <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> looked, whilst
         he declared to <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName>, that he

        would not give up the point either.—
        My lady's <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> were young and ill broke,
        they tell me, and there was no managing
        of them no ways.—The carriages got some

         all,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—<said>lay me on this 
         sofa, and leave me to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName></said>.            
        </p>
        <p><said>What's all this?</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>,
         staggering into the room: he was much intoxicated,
         and in this condition had just 
         come home, as they were carrying <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
         Delacour</persName> up stairs: he could not be made
         to understand the truth, but as soon as he
         heard <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> voice, he insisted
         upon going up to <emph>his wife's</emph> dressing room.
         It was a very unusual thing, but neither
         <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> nor any one else could restrain
         him, the moment he had formed this
         idea; he forced his way into the room.            
        </p>
        <p><said>What's all this?—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel Lawless</persName>!</said>
         said he addressing himself to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
         whom, in the confusion of his mind,
         he mistook for the colonel, the first object 
         of his jealousy. <said><persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel Lawless</persName>,</said> cried
         his <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs>, <said>you are a villain.—I always
         knew it.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>Softly!—she's in great pain, my lord,</said>
         said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, catching <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> arm,
         just as he was going to strike <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence 
         Hervey</persName>. She led him to the sofa where
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> lay, and uncovering her
         ancle, which was much swelled, showed 
         it to him. His lordship, who was a
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">254</fw>
         humane man, was somewhat moved by this
         appeal to his remaining senses, and he began
         roaring as loud as he possibly could
         for <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">arquebusade</ecda:commodity>.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> rested her head upon
         the back of the sofa, her hands moved
         with convulsive twitches—she was perfectly
         silent. <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was in a great bustle,
         running backwards and forwards for she
         knew not what, and continually repeating,
         <said>I wish nobody would come in here but
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> and me.—My lady says nobody
         must come in.—Lord bless me!—
         my lord here too!</said>         
        </p>
        <p><said>Have you any <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">arquebusade</ecda:commodity>, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>?
        <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">Arquebusade</ecda:commodity>, for your lady directly!</said>
        cried his <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs>, following her to the
        door of the boudoir, where she was going
        for some drops.
        </p>
        <p><said>O my lord, you can't come in, I assure 
        you, my lord, there's nothing here, my
        lord, nothing of the sort,</said> said <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,
        setting her back against the door.—Her terrour
        and embarrassment instantly recalled
        all the jealous suspicions of <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>.
        <said>Woman!</said> cried he, <said>I <emph>will</emph> see whom
        you have in this room!—You have some
        one concealed there, and I <emph>will</emph> go in.</said>—   
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">255</fw>
        Then with brutal oaths he dragged <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
        from the door, and snatched the key
        from her struggling hand.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady <sic>Dalacour</sic></persName> started up, and gave a
         scream of agony. <said>My lord!—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lord Delacour</persName>,</said>

        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName> stopped short.—<said>Tell

        <said>No!—No!—No!</said> answered <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
        <said>THen a lover of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman's</persName></said> said
        <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>—<said>Gad! we have hit it now,
        I believe.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Believe whatever you please, my

        the key.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> drew the key from
        <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> hand, gave it to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
        Portman</persName> without looking at her, and immediately
        withdrew.—<persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName> followed
        him with a sort of drunken laugh;
        and no one remained in the room but
        <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.—
        <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was so much <emph>fluttered</emph>, as she said,
        that she could do nothing.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> 
        locked the room door, and began to un-
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">256</fw>
        dress <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, who lay motionless.
        <said>Are we by ourselves,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
        opening her eyes.            
        </p>
        <p><said>Yes—are you much hurt?</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
        <said>O, you are a charming girl!</said>
         said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.—<said>Who would have
         thought you had so much presence of
         mind and courage—have you the key
         safe?</said> <said>Here it is,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, producing
         it; and she repeated her question
         —<said>are you much hurt?</said> <said>I am not in
         pain now,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but I
         <emph>have</emph> suffered terribly.—If I could get rid
         of all this finery—if you could put me to
         bed I could sleep perhaps.</said>
        </p>
        <p>Whilst <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was undressing <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
        Delacour</persName>, she shrieked several times; but
        between every interval of pain she repeated,
        <said>I shall be better to-morrow.</said> As
        soon as she was in bed, she desired <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
        to give her double her usual quantity
        of <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity>; for that all the inclination
        which she had felt to sleep was gone, and
        that she could not endure the shooting
        pains that she felt in her breast.            
        </p>
        <p><said>Leave me alone with your lady, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,</said>
         said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName>, taking the bot-
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">257</fw>
        tle of <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity> from her trembling hand,
        <said>and go to bed; for I am sure you are not
        able to sit up any longer.</said>
        </p>
        <p>As she spoke, she took <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> into
        the adjoinding dressing-room.—<said>O dear
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#marriott">Marriott</persName>, who was
        sincerely attached to her lady, and who at
        this instant forgot all her jealousies, and all
        her love of power—<said>I'll do any thing you
        ask me—but pray let me stay in the room,
        though I know I'm quite helpless.—It will
        be too much for you to be here all night
        by yourself.—The convulsions may take
        my lad.—What shrieks she gives every
        now and then!—and nobody knows what's
        the matter but ourselves; and every body
        in the house is asking me why a surgeon
        is not sent for, if my lady is so much hurt.
        O, I can't answer for it to my conscience,
        to have kept the matter secret so long; for
        to be sure a physician, if had in time,
        might have saved my lady—but now nothing
        can save her!</said>—And here <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
        burst into tears.
        </p>
        <p><said>Why don't you give me the <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity>?</said>
        cried <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in a loud peremptory
        voice—<said>Give it to me instantly.</said>
        —<said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> firmly.—
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">258</fw>   
        <said>Hear me, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—you must allow
        me to judge, for you know that you
        are not in a condition to judge for yourself
        —or rather you must allow me to send
        for a physician, who may judge for us
        both.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>A physician!</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
         —<said>Never—never.—I charge you let no

         not betray me.</said>   
        </p>
       <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>of that I have
       given sufficient proof—but you will betray 
       yourself—it is already known by your
       <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servant">servants</ecda:persGroup> that you have been hurt by the
       overturn of your carriage—if you do not
       let either a surgeon or physician see you,
       it will excited surprise and suspician.—It
       is not in your power when violent pain
       seizes you to refrain from</said>—<said>It is,</said> interrupted
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>not another
       scream shall you hear—only do not, do not,
       my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, send for a physician.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><said>You will thrown yourself again into

       you see, has lost all command of herself—
       I shall not have the strength to manage you—
       perhaps I may lose my presence of mind,
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">259</fw>
       I cannot answer for myself—your husband
       may desire to see you.</said>           
       </p>
      <p><said>No danger of that,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
       <said>tell him my ancle is sprained—
       tell him I am bruised all over—tell him
       any thing you will—he will not trouble
       himself any more about me—he will forget
       all that passed to-night by the time he is
       sober.—O!—give me the <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity>,
       dearest <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>—and say no more about
       physicians.</said>          
      </p>
      <p>It was in vain to reason with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> attempted to persuade
        her—<said>for my sake, dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
        said she, <said>let me send for <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, he
        is a man of honour, your secret will be
        perfectly safe with him.</said>
      </p>
      <p><said>He will tell it to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarece Hervey</persName>,</said>
       said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—<said>of all men living I
       would not send for <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, I will not
       see him if he comes.</said>
      </p>
      <p><said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, calmly, but
       with a fixed determination of countenance,
       <said>I must leave you to morrow morning—
       I must return to <placeName>Bath</placeName>.</said>          
      </p> 
      <p><said>Leave me! remember your promise.</said>          
      </p>
     <p><said>Circumstances have occurred, about

     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> hesitated. <said>You see,</said>
      continued <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>that I am in earnest,
      when I am gone you will have no friend
      left—when I am gone your secret will
      inevitably be discovered, for without me
      <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> will not have sufficient strength
      of mind to keep it.</said>
     </p>
     <p><said>Do you think we might trust <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.

     </p>
     <p><said>I am sure you may trust him,</said> said
      <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> with energy: <said>I will pledge my
      life upon his honour.</said>         
     </p>
     <p><said>Then send for him, since it must be
     so,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.          
     </p>
     <p>No sooner had the words passed <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
     Delacour's</persName> lips, than <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> flew to execute
     her orders.—<persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> recovered her
     senses, when she heard that her ladyship
     had consented to send for a physician, but
     she declared, that she could not conceive
     how any thing less than the power of
     magic could have brought her lady to such
     a determination.
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had scarcely dispatched a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant">servant</ecda:anonPers>
     for <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, when <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">261</fw>
    repented of the permission she had given,
    and all that could be said to pacify, only
    irritated her temper.—She became delirous;
    <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> presence of mind never
    forsook her, she remained quietly beside
    the bed waiting for the arrival of <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.
    X―</persName>, and she absolutely refused admittance
    to the <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servant">servants</ecda:persGroup>, who, drawn by their
    lady's outrageous cries, continually came
    to her door with offers of assistance.
     </p>
     <p>About four o'clock the doctor arrived,
     and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> was relieved from some
     of her anxiety. He assured her taht there
     was no immediate danger, and he promised
     that the secret which she had entrusted
     to him should be faithfully kept.—
     He remained with her some hours, till
     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> became more quiet and
     fell asleep, exhausted with delirious exertions.
     —.<said>I think I may now leave you,</said>
     said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, but as he was going
     through the dressing-room. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> stopped
     him.—<said>Now that I have time to
     think of myself,</said> said she—<said>let me consult
     you as my friend—I am not used to
     act entirely for myself, and I shall be most
     grateful if you will assist me with your
     advice.—I hate all mysteries, but I feel
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">262</fw>
     myself bound in honour to keep the secret,
     with which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> has entrusted
     me.—Last night I was so circumstanced,
     that I could not extricate her ladyship
     without exposing myself to—to suspicion.</said>
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> then related all taht
     had passed about the mysterious door,
     which <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>, in his fit of drunken
     jealousy, had insisted upon breaking open.

     you know a woman ought not even to be

     I know not, because I cannot enter

     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—she has, I know, a peculiar

     than of indignation.—If you will have the
     goodness to come with me, I will take
     you by a back staircase up to the <emph>mysterious
     boudoir</emph>.—I am not too proud to
     give positive proofs of my speaking truth;
     the key of that room now lies on <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
     Delacour's</persName> bed—it was that which she
     grasped in her hand during her delirioum—
     she has now let it fall—It opens both the 
     doors of the boudoir—you shall see,</said>
     added <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> witha a smile, <said>that

     <said>I believe that I should absolutely refuse 
     to take any external evidence of a lady's 
     truth! but demonstration is unanswerable
     even by enemies, and I will not sacrifice your interests to the foppery of my
     politeness—so I am ready to follow you.
     The curiosity of the <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servant">servants</ecda:persGroup> may have
     been excited by last night's disturbance,
     and I see no method so certain as that 
     which you propose of preventing busy

     you will put a stop to a number of 
     charming stories by this prudence of yours
     —a romance called the <title>Mysterious Boudoir</title>,
     of nine volumes at least, might be
     written on this subject, if you would only 
     condescend to act like almost all other
     heroines, that is to say, without common
     sense.</said>
    </p> 
    <p>The <rs ref="#dr_x_0001" type="person">doctor</rs> now followed <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, and
      satisfied himself by ocular demonstration,
      that this cabinet was the retirement of
      disease, and not of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>It was about eight o'clock in the morning
      when <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> got home; he found
      <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> waiting for him. <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Clarence</persName>
      seemed to be in great agitation,
      though he endeavoured, with all the
      power which he possessed over himself,
      to suppress his emotion.
    </p>
    <p><said>You have been to see <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
      said he, calmly—<said>Is she much hurt?
      It was a terrible accident.</said>  
    </p>
    <p><said>She has been much hurt,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.

    hours delirious—but ask me no more

    say that can waken me—you look as if
    some great misfortune has befallen you,
    what is the matter?</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>O, my dear friend,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>,
     taking his hand—<said>do not jest with me, I
     am not able to bear your raillery in my
     present temper—in one word, I fear that
     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> is unworthy of my esteem—I can
     tell you no more—except that I am more
     miserable than I thought any woman
     could make me.</said>           
    </p>
    <p><said>You are in a prodigious hurry to be
    miserable,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>; <said>upon my
    word, I think you would mae a mighty 
    pretty hero in a novel; you take things
    very properly for granted, and stretched
    out upon that sofa, you act the distracted
    lover vastly well—and to complete the
    matter, you cannot tell me why you are
    more miserable than ever man or hero
    was before.—I must tell you then, that
    you have still more cause for jealousy than
    you suspect.—Ay, start—every jealous
    man starts at the sound of the word jealousy
    —a certain symptom <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">this</unclear> of the
    disease.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>You mistake me,</said> cried <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">266</fw>
    Hervey</persName>, <said>no man is less disposed to jealousy
    than I am—but—</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>But your mistress—no, not your 
    mistress, for you have never yet declared
    to her your attachment—but the lady
    you admire, will not let a drunken man
    unlock a door, and you immediately suppose</said>—        
    </p>
   <p><said>She has mentioned the circumstance
   to you!</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>, in a joyful
   tone—<said>then she <emph>must</emph> be innocent.</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>Admirable reasoning!—I was going
   to have told you just now, if you would
   have suffered me to speak connectedly,
   that you have more reason for jealousy
   than you suspect, for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> has
   actually unlocked for me—for me! look 
   at me—the door, the mysterious door—
   and whilst I live, and whilst she lives, we
   can neither of us ever tell you the cause of
   the mystery.—All I can tell you is, that
   no lover is in the case, upon my honour
   —and now, if you should ever mistake
   curiosity in your own mind for jealousy,
   expect no pity from me.</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>I should deserve none,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
   Hervey</persName>, <said>you have made me the happiest
   of men.</said>      
   </p>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">267</fw>
   <p><said>The happiest of men!—No, no; keep
   that superlative exclamation for a future
   occasion.—But now you behave like a
   reasonable creature, you deserve to hear
   the praises of your <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>—I am so much
   charmed with her, that I wish—</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>When can I see her,</said> interrupted
     <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>, <said>I'll go to her this instant.</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>Gently,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, <said>you forget
   what time of the day it is—you forget
   that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> has been up all
   night—that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> is extremely ill
   —and that this would be the most unseasonable opportunity you could <choice><sic>possible</sic><corr>possibly</corr></choice>
   choose for your visit.</said>       
   </p>
  <p>To this observation <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
    assented; but he immediately seized a pen
    from the <rs ref="#dr_x_0001" type="person">doctor's</rs> writing-table, and began
    a letter to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—The doctor threw
    himself upon his sofa, saying—<said>Waken
    me when you want me</said>—and in a few
    minutes he was fast asleep.
  </p> 
  <p><said>Doctor, upon second thoughts,</said> said
   <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, rising suddenly, and tearing his
   letter down the middle, <said>I cannot write
   to her yet—I forgot the reformation of
   <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>—how soon do you think
       <pb/>
       <fw type="pageNum">268</fw>
   she will be well?—Besides, I have another
   reason for not writing to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> at
   present—you must know, my dear doctor,
   that I have, or had, another mistress.</said>      
  </p>
  <p><said>Another mistress indeed!</said> cried <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr
  X―</persName>, trying to waken himself.      
  </p>
  <p><said>Good God! I do believe you've been
  asleep.</said>
  </p>
  <p><said>I do believe I have.</said>      
  </p>
  <p><said>But is it possible that you could fall
  sound asleep in that time?</said>      
  </p>
  <p><said>Very possible,</said> said the doctor,
  <said>what is there so extraordinary in a man's
  falling asleep!—men are apt to sleep some
  time within the four and twenty hours—
  unless they have half a dozen mistresses to
  keep them awak, as you seem to have,
  my good friend.</said>      
  </p>
  <p>A servant now came into the room with
    a letter, that had just arrived express from
    the country for <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice>      
  </p>
  <p><said>This is another affair,</said> cried he, rousing
      hisemf.      
  </p>
  <p>The letter required the doctor's immediate
    attendance. He shook hands with
    <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>—      
  </p>
 <p><said>My dear friend, I am really concerned
     <pb/>
     <fw type="pageNum">269</fw>
 that I cannot stay to hear the history of
 your six mistresses; but you see that this
 is an affair of life and death.</said>     
 </p>
 <p><said>Farewell,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, <said>I have
 not six, I have only three goddesses; even
 if you could <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> for one.—But
 I really wanted your advice in good

 </p>
 <p><said>If your case be desperate, you can

 you my advice gratis, in the formula of an

      he found that she was out of all immediate

      that he was obliged to quit her at this
      time, but she felt the necessity for his going;
      he was sent for to attend <persName ref="#horton_0001">Mr. Horton</persName>,
      an intimate friend of his, a gentleman of
      great talents, and of the most active benevolence,
      who had just been seized with 
      a violent fever, in consequence of his exertions 
      in saving the poor inhabitants of a

     life, compared with the chance of saving

     in the world—I am of none—go this instant,

     <p><said>What a pity,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, as he
     left the room, <said>that a woman who is capable

     <p><persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr X―</persName> shook his head—but returning
      to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, after going half way

     to read the paper which he had given to

     by no means certain, that <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
     really had the complaint, which she so

      <p>After reading this paper, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had
       some faint hopes that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> life
       might be saved; but she determined to
       wait till <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> should return to town,
       before she mentioned his opinion to his pa-

       tient; and she earnestly hoped that no idea
       of putting herself into ignorant hands
       would recur to her ladyship.
      </p>
      <p><persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName>, in the morning, when
       he was sober, retained but a confused
       idea of the events of the preceding night;
       but he made an awkwardly good nature
       apology to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> for his intrusion,
       and for the disturbance he had occasioned,
       which he said, must be laid to the blame
       of <persName ref="#studley_0001">lord Studley's</persName> admirable <ecda:food>Burgandy</ecda:food>.—
       He expressed much concern for <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
       terrible accident, but he could
       not help observing, that if his advice had
       been taken, the thing could not have happened
       —that it was the consequence of
       her ladyship's self-willedness about the
       young <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>.
      </p>
      <p><said>How she got the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> without paying

      <said>for I said I would have nothing
      to do with the business, and I have kept
      to my resolution.</said>    
      </p>
     <p>His <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs> finished his morning visit
       to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, by observing that <said>the
       house would now be very dull for her; that
       the office of a nurse was ill-suited to so
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">274</fw>       
       young and beautiful a lady, but that her
       undertaking it with so much cheerfulness
       was a proof of a degree of good nature,
       that was not always to be met with in the
       young and handsome.</said>
     </p>
     <p>The manner in which <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>
       spoke convinced <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, that he was in
       reality attached to his <rs ref="#delacour_0001" type="person">wife</rs>, however the
       fear of being, or of appearing to be governed
       by her ladyship might have 
       estranged him from her, and from home.—
       She now saw in him much more good sense,
       and symptoms of a more amiable character
       than his lady lady had described, or than she
       ever would allow that he possessed.
     </p>    
     <p>The reflections, however, which <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
     Portman</persName> made upon the miserable life 
     this ill-matched couple led together
     did not incline her in favour of marriage 
     in general; great talents on one
     side, and good nature on the other, had,
     in this instance, tended only to make
     each party unhappy. Matches of interest,
     convenience, and vanity, she was 
     convinced diminished, instead of increasing
     happiness.—Of domestic felicity
     she had never, except during her childhood,
     seen examples—she had, indeed,
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">275</fw>
     heard from <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> descriptions of the
     happy family of <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival</persName>, but
     she feared to indulge the romantic hope
     of every being loved by a man of superior
     genius and virtue, with a temper
     and manners suited to her taste.—The
     only person she had seen, who at all
     answered this description, was <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>,
     and it was firmly fixed in her mind,
     that he was not a marrying man, and
     consequently not a man of whom any
     prudent woman would suffer herself to
     think with partiality. She could not doubt
     that he liked her society and conversation;
     his manner had sometimes expressed
     more than cold esteem.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
     had assured her that it expressed love;
     but <persName ref="ld">lady Delacour</persName> was  an imprudent woman
     in her own conduct, and not scrupulous
     as to that of others.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was
     not guided by <emph>her</emph> opinions of propriety;
     and now that her ladyship was confined
     to her bed, and not in a position to give 
     her either advice or protection, she felt
     that it was peculiarly incumbent on her to
     guard, not only her conduct from reproach,
     but her heart from the hopeless
     misery of an ill-placed attachment.—She
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">276</fw>
     examined herself with firm impartiality—
     she recollected the excessive pain that she
     had endured, when she first heard <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence 
     Hervey</persName> say, that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName>
     was a compound of art and affectation; but
     this she thought was only the pain of offended
     pride—of proper pride.—She recollected
     tthe extreme anxiety she had felt, 
     even within the last four and twenty hours,
     concerning the opinion which he might
     form of the transaction about the key of
     the boudoir—but this anxiety she justified
     to herself; it was due, she thought,
     to her reputation; it would have been inconsistent
     with female delicacy, to have
     been indifferent about the suspicions that
     necessarily arose from the circumstances
     in which she was placed.—Before <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
      had completed her self-examination, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
      Hervey</persName> called to inquire after <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
      Delacour</persName>.—Whilst he spoke of her ladyship,
      and of his concerns for the dreadful
      accident, of which he believed himself
      to be in a great measured the cause, his
      manner and language were animated and
      unaffected; but the moment that this
      subject was exhausted, he became embarrassed;
      though he distinctly expressed
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">277</fw>
      perfect confidence and esteem for her, he
      seemed to wish, and yet to be unable to
      support the character of a friend, contradistinguished 
      to an admirer. He seemed
      conscious that he could not, with propriety,
      advert to the suspicious and jealousy
      which he had felt the preceding night;
      for a man who has never declared love
      would be absurd and impertinent, were
      he to betray jealousy.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> was destitute
      neither of address nor presence of 
      mind, but an accident happened, when
      he was just taking leave of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
      which threw him into utter confusion.—
      It surprised, if it did not confound <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
      —She had forgotten to as, <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>   
       for his direction; and as she thought it
       might be necessary to write him concerning
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> health, she begged
       of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> to give it to her.—He took
       a letter out of his pocket, and wrote the
       direction with a pencil, but as he opened
       the paper, to tear off the outside, on which
       he had been writing, a lock of hair dropped 
       out of the letter; he hastily stooped
       for it, and as he took it up from the
       ground the lock unfolded.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
       though she cast but one involuntary, 
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">278</fw>
       hasty glance on it, was struck with the
       beauty of it's colour, and it's uncommon
       length.—The confusion of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
       convinced her, that he was extremely
       interested about the person to whom the
       hair belonged, and the species of alarm
       which she had felt at this discovery,
       opened her eyes effectually to the state of
       her own heart.—She was sensible that the
       sight of a lock of hair, however long, or
       however beautiful, in the hands of any
       man but <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, could not possibly
       have excited any emotion in her mind. 
       <said>Fortunately,</said> thought she, <said>I have
       discovered that he is attached to another,
       whilst it is yet in my power to command
       my affections, and he shall see that I am
       not so weak as to form any false expectations
       from what I must now consider as 
       mere commonplace flattery.</said> <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
       was glad that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was not present
       at the discovery of the lock of hair,
       as she was aware that she would have 
       rallied her unmercifully upon the occasion;
       and she rejoiced that she had not been
       prevailed upon to give <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr"><persName ref="#pomenars_0001">madame la comtesse
       de Pomenars</persName></foreign> a lock of her <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">belle chevelure</foreign>.
       She could not help thinking,
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">279</fw>
       from the recollection of several minute
       circumstances, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> had
       endeavoured to gain an interest in her
       affections, and she felt that there would
       be great impropriety in receiving his ambiguous
       visits during <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> confinement
       to her room.—She therefore
       gave orders, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> should not
       in future be admitted, till her ladyship
       should again see company. This precaution
       proved totally superfluous, for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr.
       Hervey</persName> never called again, during the
       whole course of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> confinement;
       though his <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant">servant</ecda:anonPers> regularly came
       every morning with inquiries after her
       ladyship's health.—She kept her room for
       about ten days: a confinement to which
       she submitted with extreme impatience:
       bodily pain she bore with fortitude, but
       constraint and ennui she could not endure.
     </p>
      <p>One morning as she was sitting up in
       bed, looking over a large collection of notes,
       and cards of enquiry after her health, she
       exclaimed—

       on tiptoes—to see people gliding about
       like ghosts makes me absolutely fancy myself
       amongst the shades below.—I would
       rather be stunned by the loudest peal,
       that ever thundering footman gave at my

       <p>Now <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> had a prodigious affection

       </p>
       <p><said>Odious! O dear, my lady! to call my

       <p><persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> turned sharply round upon
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, and darted a fierly look at
         her through the midst of her tears.—
         <said>Then 'tis plain,</said> said she, <said>who I'm to
         thank for this,</said> and as soon as she left the room her
           lady could not complain of her shutting
           the door after her too gently.           
       </p>  
       <p><said>Give her three minute's grace and she

       —<said>for she is not bankrupt in sense.
       —O, three minutes won't do, I must allow

       Delacour</persName> when <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> half an hour afterward
       reappeared, with a face which might 
       have sat for the picture of ill humour.
       Her ill humour, however, did not prevent
       her from attending her lady as usual; she
       performed all her customary offices with
       the most officious zeal, but in profound
       silence, except every now and then she
       would utter a sigh, which seemed to say,
       <said>See how much I'm attached to my lady,
       and yet my lady hates my <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>!</said> Her
        lady, who perfectly understood the language
        of sighs, and felt the force of <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott's</persName>,
       forebore to touch again on the tender
       subject of the <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>, hoping that when
        her house was once more filled with com-
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">283</fw>
        pany, she should be relieved by more agreeable
        noises from continually hearing this 
        pertinacious tormentor.
       </p>
       <p>As soon as it was known that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        was sufficiently recovered to receive
        company, her door was crowded with carriages;
        and as soon as it was understood
        that balls and concerts were to go on as 
        usual at her house, her <quote rend="quotes" source="#shakespeare_cleopatra">troop of friends</quote>
        appeared to congratulate her, and to amuse
        themselves.
       </p>
       <p><said>How stupid it is,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>to hear congratulatory
        speeches from people, who would not care
        if I were in the black hole at <placeName>Calcutta</placeName> this

        <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, however, <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">n'a

        of the whole evil, and he blames himself 
        so sincerely, and so unjustly, that I really
        was half tempted to undeceive him; but
        that would have been doing him an injury;
        for you know great philosophers tell us,

        my fancy, or is not <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> wonderfully
        changed?—Is not he grown pale and thing,
        and serious, not to say melancholy? What 
        have you done to him since I have been
        ill?</said>
       </p>
       <p><said>Nothing—I have never seen him.</said></p>
       <p><said>No! then the thing is accounted for
       very naturally—he is in despair, because
       he has been manished from your divine
       presence.</said>           
       </p>
      <p><said>More likely, because he has been in
      anxiety about your ladyship,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.          
      </p>
      <p><said>I will find out the cause, let it be what
      it may,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—<said>luckily my
      address is equal to my curiosity, and that
      is saying a great deal.</said>          
      </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding all her ladyship's address,
        her curiosity was baffled; she could
        not discover <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> secret, and
       she began to believe, that the change which
       she had noticed in is looks and manner
       was imaginary or accidental. Had she
       seen more of him, at this time she would
       not have so easily given up her suspicions;
       but she saw him only for a few minutes
       every day, and during that time he talked
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">285</fw>
       to her with all his former gayety: besides
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had herself a daily part to
       perform, which occupied almst her whole
       attention. Notwithstanding the vivacity
       which she affected, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> perceived that
       she was now more seriously alarmed than
       she had ever been about her health. It
       was all that her utmost exertions could accomplish
       to appear for a short time in the 
       day—some evenings she came into company
       for only half an hour, on other days
       only for a few minutes, just walked
       through the rooms, paid her compliments
       to every body, complained of a nervous
       head-ache, left <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> to do the honours
       for her, and retired.          
      </p>
      <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> was now really placed in
       a difficult and dangerous situation, and
       she had ample opportunities of learning
       and practising prudence.—<ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">All the fashionable
       dissipated young men in <placeName>London</placeName></ecda:persGroup> frequented
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> house, and it was
       said, that they were drawn thither by the
       attractions of her fair representative. The
       <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> considered a niece of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs
       Stanhope's</persName> as their lawful prize. The
       <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">ladies</ecda:persGroup> wondered that the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">men</ecda:persGroup> could think
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> a beauty; but whilst they
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">286</fw>
       affected to scorn, they sincerely feared her
       charms. Thus left entirely to her own
       discretion, she was exposed at once to the 
       malignant eye of envy, and the insidious
       voice of flattery—she had no friend, no
       guide, and scarcely a protector: her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt
       Stanhope's</persName> letters, indeed, continually supplied 
       her with advice, but with advice
       which she could not follow consistently
       with her own feelings and principles.—
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>, even if she had been well,
       was not a person on whose counsels she
       could rely; our heroine was not one of
       those daring spirits, who are ambitious of
       acting for themselves; she felt the utmost
       diffidence of her own powers, yet at the
       same time a firm resolution not to be led
       even by timidity into follies, which the example
       of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had taught her to
       despise. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> prudence seemed to
       increase with the necessity for it's exertion.
       It was not the mercenary wily prudence of
       a young lady, who has been taught to
       think it virtue to sacrifice the affections of
       her heart to the interests of her fortune—
       it was not the prudence of a cold and selfish,
       but of a modest and generous woman.
       —She found it most difficult to satisfy her-
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">287</fw>
       self in her conduct towards <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>:
       he seemed mortified and miserable if
       she treated him merely as a common acquaintance,
       yet she felt the danger of admitting
       him to the familiarity of friendship;
       had she been thoroughly convinced that he
       was attached to some other woman, she
       hoped that she could freely converse with
       him, and look upon him as a married man,
       but notwithstanding the lock of beautiful
       hair, she could not entirely divest herself
       of the idea that she was beloved, when she
       observed the extreme eagerness with which
       <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> watched all her motions,
       and followed her with his eye as if his fate
       depended upon her. She remarked that
       he endeavoured as much as possible to
       prevent this species of attention from being
       noticed, either by the public or by herself;
       his manner towards her every day became
       more distant and respectful, more constrained
       and embarrassed; but now and
       then a different look and expression escaped.
       She had often heard of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr Hervey's</persName>
       great <emph>address</emph> in affairs of gallantry,
       and she was sometimes inclined to believe
       that he was trifling with her, merely for
       the glory of a conquest over her heart; at 
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">288</fw>
       other times she suspected him of deeper
       designs upon her, such as would deserve
       contempt and detestation; but upon the
       whole she was despised to believe, that he
       was entangled by some former attachment
       from which he could not extricate himself
       with honour; and upon this supposition
       she thought him worthy of her esteem,
       and of her pity.

      <p>About this time <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName> began
       to pay a sort of lounging attention to

       <p>Now it seems that <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName>
           and <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName>, during the time of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarrence
          Hervey's</persName> intimacy with them, observed 
           that he paid frequent visits at 
           <placeName>Windsort</placeName>, and they took it into their heads
           that he kept a mistress there. They were
           very curious to see her, and unknown to 
           <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, they made several attempts for
           this purpose; at last one evening, when
           they were certain that he was not at
           <placeName>Windsor</placeName>, they scaled the high garden wall
           of the house which he frequented, and 
           actually obtained a sight of a beautiful 
           <rs ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001" type="person">young girl</rs> and an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">elderly lady</ecda:anonPers>, whom
           they took for her gouvernante. This adventure
           they kept a profound secret from
           <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, because they knew that he would
           have quarreled with them immediately,
           and would have called them to account 
           for their intrusion. They now determined 
           to avail themselves of their knowledge,
           and of his ignorance of this circumstnace;
           but they were sensible that it was necessary
           to go warily to work, lest they should
           betray themselves. Accordingly they be-

           <fw type="pageNum">290</fw>
           gan by dropping distant mysterious hints
           about <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>.—Such for instance

       <p><said>Damme, we all know <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary's</persName> a perfect

       —one beauty at a time is not enough
       for him—hey, damme? And it is not
       fashion, nor wit, nor elegance, and all
       that—that he looks for <emph>always</emph>.</said>
      </p>
      <p>These observations were accompanied
          with the most significant looks.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
          heard and saw all this in painful silence,
          but <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> often used her address
          to draw some farther explanation from <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir

           One morning, when <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>

           thought it incumbent upon him to eclipse
           his rival in conversation, and began to
           talk of the last fête champêtre, at <placeName>Frogmore</placeName>.
       </p>
       <p><said>What a cursed unlucky overturn that

       this sprain, and this nervous business,
       you've not been able to stir out since the

       and all that, at <placeName>Frogmore</placeName>—why all the

       <p><said>I regret extremely that my illness

       —<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> assured her that she felt no

       </p>
       <p><said>O, damme! but I would have driven

        was the finest sight and best conducted I

       to make it complete.—We had <ecda:persGroup>gipsies</ecda:persGroup>,

           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">292</fw>

        damme, I don't know how they came

        we had some famous glees—and <persName ref="#fawcett_0001">Fawcett</persName>
        gave us his laughing song, and then we
        had the launching of the ship, and ony it

        enough—but damme, the song of <persName ref="#polly_oliver_0001">Polly

        them—and after that, he sported a musquet

        dance, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, which was damned

        those <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-aig="hungarian"><rs type="properAdjective">Hungarian</rs> fellows</ecda:persGroup>—they jump and
        turn about, and clap their knees with

           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">293</fw>
        of ways—and then we had that song of

        <persName ref="#mills_0001">Mrs. Mills</persName> gave us—no, no—it was a

         places built of brick, out in the air—and 
         then the entrance to the ball room was all
         a colonnade done with lamps and <ecda:flora>flowers</ecda:flora>,
         and that sort of thing—and there was
         some bon mot (but that was in the morning)
         amongst the <ecda:persGroup>gipsies</ecda:persGroup> about an <ecda:flora ana="#food">orange</ecda:flora>,
         and the stadtholder—and then there was
         a <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> dance, and a <rs type="properAdjective">Polonese</rs> dance,
         all very fine, but nothing compared to 
         the <rs type="properAdjective">Pyrrhic</rs> touch, which was a great deal

       </p> 
       <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> assured <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> that
        she had been more entertained by the description,
        than she could have been by the
        reality.—<said><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, was it not the best

            <fw type="pageNum">294</fw>
        favour us with <emph>a touch</emph> of the <rs type="properAdjective">Pyrrhic</rs>

       </p>
       <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> spoke with such polite

           penetration and so much conceit, that he
           did not suspect of her of irony: he eagerly
           began to exhibit the <rs type="properAdjective">Pyrrhic</rs> dance, but
           in such a manner, that it was impossible
           for human gravity to withstand the sight,
           —<persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName> laughed first, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           followed him, and <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> and
           <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> could no longer restrain themselves.
       </p>
       <p><said>Damme, now I believe you've all
       been quizzing me, damme,</said> cried the
       baronet, and he fell into a sulky silence,
       eyeing <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>
       from time to time with what he meant 
       for a <emph>knowing</emph> look. His silence and sulkiness
       lasted till <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> took his leave.
       Soon afterward <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> retired to the
       music room. <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip</persName> then begged to
       speak a few words to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, with
       a face of much importance; and after a
       preamble of nonsensical expletives, he
       said that his regard for his ladyship and
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> made him wish to explain
       hints which had been dropped from him

           <fw type="pageNum">295</fw>
       at times, and which he could not explain
       to her satisfaction, without a promise of
       inviolable secrecy.—<said>As <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName> is, or
       was a sort of a friend, I can't, damme,
       mention this sort of thing without such a
       preliminary.</said>—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> gave the
       preliminary promise, and <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> informed 
       her, that people began to take notice
       that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName> was an admirer of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
       Portman's</persName>, and that it might be a disadvantage
       to the young lady, as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>
       could have no serious intentions, because
       he had an attachment, to his certain
       knowledge, elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p><said>A matrimonial attachment?</said> said

       <p><said>Why damme, as to matrimony, I

       <p><said>O damme, yes, she is not more than

               <fw type="pageNum">296</fw>
           taken her away from <placeName>Windsor</placeName>.—She was
           then with a <ecda:anonPers>gouvernante</ecda:anonPers>, and is as proud
           as the devil, which smells like matrimony
           for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary</persName>.</said>          
       </p>
        <p><said>And do you know this peerless damsel's

        </p>
        <p><said>Damme, I think the old <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#jezabel_0001">Jezabel</persName></ecda:anonPers> called

         and I are extremely obliged by your

        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip</persName> then, with more than his usual

        </p> 
        <p>When <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> repeated this story
          to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, she concluded by saying—

        have always considered <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> as—</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>O, as a common acquaintance, no

        marry a girl who has been his mistress for
        half a dozen years—do not look so shocked,
        my dear, I really cannot help laughing
        —I congratulate you, however, that the
        thing is no worse—it is all in rule and in
        course—when a man marries he sets up
        new equipages, and casts off old mistresses
        ―or if you like to see the thing as woman
        of sentiment, rather than as a woman
        of the world, here is the prettiest opportunity
        for your lover's making a sacrifice.
        —I am sorry I cannot make you
        smile my dear—but consider, as nobody
        knows this naughty thing but ourselves,
        we are not called upon to bristle up our

            <fw type="pageNum">298</fw>
        the world do not expect men to be as

        measure of our external indignation to our
        real feelings—<persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> cannot stir in the
        business—for he knows <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> would
        call him out, if his secret viz to <persName ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001">Virginia</persName>

        of your air at this instant, that you
        would sooner die the death of the sentimental

        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> without any haughtiness, but

        —That the ambiguity of his conduct towards
        her had determined her long since
        to guard her affections, and that she had
        the satisfaction to feel, that they were entirely
        under her command.</said>

        this instant obey your wishes and express

        a portion of your esteem from <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr.
        Hervey</persName>—that is the style for you, is it
        not!—After all, my dear, the whole may
        be a quizzification of <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip's</persName>—and yet
        he gave me such a minute description of

         especially from the agreement between the

         that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> had some scret attachment;
         and she could not help blaming

         whilst he knew that his heart was
         engaged to another.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> however,
         gave her no farther reason to suspect
         him of any design to win her love; for
         about this time his manner towards her
         changed, he obviously endeavoured to
         avoid her; his visits were short, and his
         attention was principally directed to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
         Delacour</persName>; when she retired, he took his

         to himself.—The baronet, who thought
         that he had succeeded in producing a
         coldness between <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> and his rival,
         was surprised to find, that he could not
         gain any advantage for himself; for some
         time he had not the slightest thoughts of
         any serious connection with the lady, but
         at last he was piqued by her indifference,
         and by the raillery of his friend <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>.

        <p><said>Damme, I could make her sing to

        <p>The <rs ref="#philip_baddely_0001" type="person">Baronet</rs> vibrated for some time,

         At last, what he called love prevailed over
         prudence, and he was resolved, cost him
         what it would, to have <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName>.
         He had not the least doubt of being accepted,
         if he made a proposal of marriage;
         consequenty, the moment that he
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">302</fw>
         came to this determination, he could not

       <p><said>O, damme, ma'am, then I've no more

       I, or what must the world conclude, but
       that she's very unaccountable, or that
       she's engaged—which last I presume to

           <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> a good morning, and decamped
           with a look of silly ill humour.—
           He was determined to write to <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
           whose influence over her niece he
           had no doubt would be decisive in his favour.
           <said><persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip</persName> seems to be a little out

               <fw type="pageNum">309</fw>
           of sorts this morning,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>,
           <said>I am afraid he's angry with me for interrupting
           his conversation; but relaly I did
           not know he was here, and I wanted to
           catch you a moment alone, that I might,
           in the firstp lace, thank you for all your
           goodness to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—she has had a 
           tedous sprain of it; these nervous fevers
           and convulsions—I don't understand them,
           but I think <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―'s</persName> prescriptions seem
           to have done her good, for she is certainly
           better of late, and I am glad to hear music
           and people again in the house, becaue I
           know all this is what my <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           likes, and there is no reasonable indlulgence
           that I would not willingly allow a
           wife; but I think there is a medium in all
           things.—I am not a man to be governed 
           by a wife, and when I have once said a
           thing, I like to be steady, and always shall.
           And I am sure <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> has too much
           good sense to think me wrong: for now,
           <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, in that quarrel about the
           <ecda:commodity>coach</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity">horses</ecda:fauna>, which you heard part of
           one morning at breakfast—I must tell you
           the beginning of that quarrel.</said>           
       </p>
        <p><said>Excuse me, my lord, but I would ra-
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">310</fw>
        ther hear of the end than of the beginning
        of quarrels.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>That shows your good sense as well
        s your good nature. I wish you could
        make my <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> of your taste—
        she does not want sense—but then (I speak
        to you freely of all that lies upon my mind,
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, for I know—I <emph>know</emph> you
        have no delight in making mischief in a
        house)—between you and me, her sense
        is not of the right kind.—A woman may
        have too much wit—now too much is as
        bad as too little, and in a woman, worse;
        and when two people come to quarrel, then
        wit on either side, but more especially on
        the wife's, you know, is very provoking—
        'tis like concealed weapons, which are
        wisely forbidden by law.—If a person kill
        another in a fray with a concealed weapon,
        ma'am, by a sword in a cane for instance,
        'tis murder by the law. Now even if it
        were not contrary to law, I would never
        have such a thing in my cane to carry
        about with me; for when a man's in a
        passion he forgets every thing, and would
        as soon lay about him with a swords as with
        a cane—so it is better such a thing should
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">311</fw>
        not be in his power. And it is the same
        with wit, which would be safest and best
        out of the power of some people.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>But is it fair, my lord, to make use of 
        wit yourself to abuse wit in others?</said> said
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> with a smile, which put his <rs ref="#delacour_0002" type="person">lordship</rs>
         into perfect good humour with both
         himself and his lady. <said>Why really,</said> said
         he, <said>there would be no living with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
         Delacour</persName>, if I did not come out with a little
         sly bit of wit now and then; but it is what 
         I am not in the habit of doing—I assure
         you, except when very hard pushed.—But,
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, as you like so much to hear
         the end of quarrels, here's the end of one
         which you have a particular right to hear
         something of,</said> continued his lordship,
         taking out his pocket-book and producing
         some <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">bank notes</ecda:commodity>—<said>you should have received
         this before, madam, if I had known
         of the transaction sooner—of your part of 
         it, I mean.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said><distinct type="dialect">Milord, de men call to speak about

        <p><said><distinct type="dialect">Yes, milord—milord has it in his pocket

        </p>
        <p><said>Here it is,</said> said his <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs>, and as

        </p>
        <p><said>Here,</said> continued <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>, as
         <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> had left the room—<said>here are
         your <measure ana="#currency #commodity">two hundred guineas</measure>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
         and as I am going to this man about my

         the day, let me trouble you the next time
         you see <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> to give her this
         pocket-book from me.—I should be sorry
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, from any thing that has
         passed, should run away with the idea that
         I am a niggardly husband, or a tyrant,
         though I certainly like to be master in my
         own house.—What are you doing, madam?
         —that is your note, that does not go
         into the pocket-book, you know.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Permit me to put it in, my lord,</said> said
            <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, returning the pocket-book to him,

            the pleasure of seeing you; she has in-
                <pb/>
                <fw type="pageNum">313</fw>
            quired several times whether your lordship
            were at home. I will run up to her dressing
            room, and tell her that you are here.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>How lightly she goes, on the wings of
        good nature!</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>, <said>I can
        do no less than follow her; for though I
        like to be treated with respect in my own
        house, there is a time for every thing.—I
        would not give <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> the trouble
        of coming down here to seem me with her
        sprained ancle, especially as she has inquired
        for me several times.</said>            
        </p>
        <p>His <rs ref="#delacour_0002" type="person">lordship's</rs> visit was not of unseasonable
         length; for he recollected that the
         man who came about the <ecda:food ana="#commodity">burgundy</ecda:food> was
         waiting for him. But, perhaps, the shortness
         of the visit rendered it the mroe pleasing,
         for <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> afterward said to
          <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>—            
        </p>
        <p><said>My dear, would you believe it, my
        <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> was absolutely a perfect
        example of the useful and agreeable this
        morning—who knows but he may become
        the sublime and beautiful in time.—<foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">En attendant</foreign>
        here are your <measure ana="#currency #commodity">two hundred guineas</measure>,
        my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>—a thousand thanks
        for the thing, and a million for the manner
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">314</fw>
        —manner is all in all in conferring favours.
        My lord, who, to do him justice, has too
        much honesty to pretend to more delicacy
        than he really possesses, told me that he
        had been taking a lesson from <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>
        this morning in the art of obliging;
        and really, for a grown gentleman, and for
        the first lesson, he comes on surprisingly.
        I do think, that by the time he is a widower,
        his lordship will be quite another
        thing—quite an agreeable man—not a genius,
        not a <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, that you cannot
        expect.—Apropos, what is the reason
        that we have seen so little of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence 
        Hervey</persName> lately? He has certainly some
        secret attraction elsewhere.—It cannot be
        that <rs ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001" type="person">girl</rs> <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> mentioned.—No—she's
        nothing new. Can it be at <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne
        Percival's</persName>?—or where can it be? Whenever
        he sees me I think he asks, when we
        go to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>.—Now <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> is
        within a few miles of <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>. I will
        not go there, that's decided. <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">Lady Anne</persName>
        is an exemplary matron, so she is out of
        the case; but I hope she has no <quote rend="italic" source="#richardson_grandison">sister excellence</quote>,
        no niece, no cousin, to entangle
        our hero.</said>

           <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> told me, that he saw <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName>
           part from you this morning in a terrible
           bad humour.—Come, whilst you tell your
           story, help me to string these pearls; that
           will save you from the necessity of looking
           at me, and will conceal your blushes—
           You need not be afraid of betraying <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir
           Philip's</persName> secrets; for I could have told you
           long ago, taht he would inevitably propose
           for you—the fact is nothing new or surprising
           to me, but I should really like
           to hear how ridiculous the man
           made himself.</said>

           <p><said>And that,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>is the only

            <p><said>Lord, my dear, surely it is no secret

                <fw type="pageNum">316</fw>
            that <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName> is ridiculous—but
            you are so good natured that I can't be

                 on business.—I am sure what I told

                 he has promised to come back to dine with
                 me—M. le comte, you will dine with us,

                   suddenly recollected that it was time to

                   took his leave, a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">footman</ecda:anonPers> met her, and told her
                   that <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> was in the drawing-room,
                   and wished to speak to her. Many conjectures
                   were formed in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mind as
                   she passed on to the drawing-room; but
                   
                   
                   the moment that she opened the door, she
                   knew the nature of <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey's</persName> business,
                   for she saw the glass globe containing
                   <persName ref="#hd">Helena Delacour's</persName> <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna> standing
                   on the table beside him. <said>I have

                   for <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>;
                   <said>and I have seldom received a commission
                   that has given me so much pleasure
                   —I perceive that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> is indeed
                   a real friend to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—How
                   happy she is to have such a friend!</said>
               </p>
               <p>After a pause <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> went on
                   speaking of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, and of his
                   earnest desire to see her as happy in domestic
                   life as she <emph>appeared</emph> to be in public.
                   He frankly confessed, that when he
                   was first acquainted with her ladyship, he
                   had looked upon her merely as a dissipated
                   woman of fashion, and had considered
                   only his own amusement in cultivating her
                   society—<said>But,</said> continued he, <said>of late
                   I have formed a different opinion of her
                   character; and I think, from what I have
                   observed, that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> ideas on
                   this subject agree with mine. I had laid
                   a plan for bringing her ladyship's acquaintance
                   with <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>, who appears
                   
                   
                   
                   to me one of the most amiable and one of
                   the happiest of women. <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> is but
                   a few miles from <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>—But I am
                   disappointed in this scheme; <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
                   has changed her mind, she says,
                   and will not go there. <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName>, however,
                   has just told me, that, though it is
                   July, and though she loves the country,
                   she will most willingly stay in town a 
                   month longer, as she thinks that, with
                   your assistance, there is some probability
                   of her effecting a reconciliation between
                   <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and <ecda:persGroup><rs type="person" ref="#md">her husband's</rs> relations</ecda:persGroup>,
                   with some of whom <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> is intimately
                   acquainted. To begin with my 
                   friend <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName>: the <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>
                   was most graciously received, and I
                   flatter myself that I ahve prepared <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs.
                   Delacour</persName> to think somewhat more favorably

                   do. All now depends upon <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
                   conduct towards her daughter—If
                   she continues to treat her with neglect, I
                   shall be convinced that I have been mistaken
                   in her character.</said>

                   she certainly was not sorry to hear from
                   her own lips a distinct explanation of his
                   views and sentiments. She assured him
                   that no effort that she could make with
                   propriety should be wanting, to effect
                   the desirable reconciliation between her 
                   ladyship and her family; as she perfectly
                   agreed with him in thinking, that <persName ref="#ld">lady
                   Delacour's</persName> character had been generally
                   misunderstood by the world.

                was aware of. It is tacitly understood
                by the public, that every lady goes bail
                for the character of her female friends.
                If <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had been so fortunate as

                in her early life, what a different
                woman she would have been! She once
                said some such thing to me herself, and
                she never appeared to me so amiable as at

                     gather a sprig from a <ecda:flora>myrtle</ecda:flora>, which stood
                     on the hearth. She perceived that the

                 <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> appeared under some

                     open his real feelings: his manner varied
                     continually. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> could not avoid seeing
                     his perplexity—she had recourse again
                     to the <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna>, and to <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>: upon
                     these subjects they could both speak

                 <p>It was observed, that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
                 dressed herself this day with the most

                 <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> curiosity was reaised
                     
                     
                     
                   by the description which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> and

                   and who wanted nothing from her but her love.

                 <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> told her, that the <emph>unknown</emph>
                     would probably come half an hour
                     earlier to the reading party than any of the
                     rest of the company. Her <rs type="person" ref="#ld">ladyship</rs> was
                     alone in the library, when <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>
                     brought <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, in consequence of a

                 <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> ran down stairs to the

                 seems to like all noises except the

                 I shall not dispute their merits. Verily,

                 that is to day, of above half the world.
                 I eveny them not their hard-earned fame.
                 Let ceremony curtsy to ceremony with

                 <p><said>And how  came <rs ref="#ap" type="person">her ladyship</rs> to give

                 <p><said>She gave them to me,</said> said <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>,
                  hesitating.

                 <p><said>You need not blush, nor repeat to
                 me that she gave them to you; that I
                 have heard already—that is the fact—
                 now for the cause: unless it be a secret.
                 —If it be a secret which you have been
                 desired to keep, you are quite right
                 to keep it.—I make no doubt of it's 
                 being necessary, according to some systems
                 of education, that children should
                 be taught to keep secrets; and I am convinced
                 (for <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName> is, I have 
                 heard, a perfect judge of propriety) that
                 it is peculiarly proper that a daughter
                 should know how to keep secrets from
                 her mother: therefore, my dear! yiou 
                 need not trouble yourself to blush or he-
                 
                 
                 
                 sitate any more—I shall ask no farther
                 quetions,—I was not aware that there
                 was any secret in the case.</said>

                <p><said>Us all?</said>                    
                </p> 
               <p><said>I mean <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>, and <persName ref="#edward_percival_0001">Edward</persName>, and me
               to give her an account of some experiments,
               on the hearing of <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna>, which
               <persName ref="#rx">doctor X―</persName> had told to us; she promised
               to give the <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna> of which
               we were all very fond, to whichever of
               us should give the best account of them
               —<persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> gave the <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna> to me.</said>                   
               </p> 
               <p><said>And this is all the secret?—So, it
               was real modesty made her hesitate, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>?
               I beg your pardon, my dear—and
               <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne's</persName>—You see how candid I am,
               <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. But one question more, <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>:
               
               
               
               Who put it into you head to send me
               your <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna>?</said>                   
               </p>
               <p><said>Nobody, mamma; no one put it into
               my head—But I was at the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="birdfancier">bird-fancier's</ecda:anonPers>
               yesterday, when <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> was trying
               to get some <ecda:fauna>bird</ecda:fauna> for <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Mrs. Marriott</persName>, that
               could not make any noise to disturb you:
               so I thought that my <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna> would be the nicest
               things for you in the world; because 
               they cannot make the least noise, and
               they are as pretty as any <ecda:fauna>birds</ecda:fauna> in the
               word—prettier, I think—and I hope
               <persName ref="#m">Mrs. Marriott</persName> thinks so too.</said>                   
               </p>
               <p><said>I don't know what <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> thinks
               about the matter, but I can tell you what
               I think,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>that you
               are one of the sweetest little girls in the
               world, and that you would make me love 
               you if I had a heart of stone—which I
               have not, whatever some people may
               think—Kiss me, my child!</said>                   
               </p>  
               <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#hd">little girl</rs> sprang forwards, and
                   threw her arms round <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her mother</rs>, exclaiming
                   —<said>O, mamma! are you in earnest?</said>
                   and she pressed close to her mother's
                   bosom, clasping her with all her force.
               </p> 
               <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> screamed, and pushed
                   <rs type="person" ref="#hd">her daughter</rs> awa.
               </p>  
                 
                 
               
               <p><said>She is not angry with you my love!</said>
                 said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>she is in sudden and violent
                 pain—Don't be alarmed—she will be
                 better soon. No, don't ring the bell, but
                 try whether you can open these window-
                 shutters, and throw up the sash.</said>                   
               </p>
               <p>Whilst <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was supporting <persName ref="#ld">lady
               Delacour</persName>, and whilst <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> was trying
                to open the window, a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant">servant</ecda:anonPers> came into
                the room, to announce the <persName ref="#count_n_0001">count de

               </p> 
               <p><said>Show him into the drawing-room,</said> 
               said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.—<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, though
               in great pain, rose and retired to her
               dressing-room.—<said>I shall not be able to
               go down to these people yet,</said> said she;
               <said>you must make my excuses to the <rs ref="#count_n_0001">count</rs> 
               and to every body: and tell <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>
               I was not angry, though I pushed her
               away. Keep her below stairs. I will
               come as soon as I am able—Send <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
               —Do not forget, my dear! to tell <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>
               I was not angry.</said>                   
               </p>
               <p>The reading party went on, and <persName ref="#ld">lady
               Delacour</persName> made her appearance as the
               <ecda:persGroup>company</ecda:persGroup> were drinking <ecda:food>orgeat</ecda:food>, between
               the fourth and fifth act. <said><persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, <emph>my
               dear</emph>!</said> said she, <said>will you bring me a
               
               
               glass of <ecda:food>orgeat</ecda:food>?</said>—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> looked
               at <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> with a congratulory 
               smile:—<said>Do you not think,</said> whispered
               he, <said>that we shall succeed? Did you see
               that look of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>?</said>                   
               </p>
               <p>Nothing tends more to increase the
                esteem and affection of two people for
                each other, than their having one and
                the same benevolent object. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
                Hervey</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> seemed to know
                one another's thoughts and feelings this
                evening better than they had ever done
                before during the whole course of their
                acquaintance.                   
               </p>  
               <p>After the play was over most of the
                <ecda:persGroup>company</ecda:persGroup> went away; only a select party
                of <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">beaux esprits</foreign> staid to supper; they were
                standing at the table at which the <rs ref="#count_n_0001">count</rs>
                had been reading: several volumes of
                <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> plays and novels were lyfing
                there, and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, taking up
                one of them, cried: <said>Come, let us try our
                fate by the <foreign xml:lang="la">sortes Virgilanæ</foreign>.</said>                   
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> opened the book, which
                was a volume of <title ref="#marmontel_contes"><persName ref="#jean_francois_marmontel_1723">Marmontel's</persName> Tales</title>.

               <p><said><quote source="#marmontel_contes" xml:lang="fr">La femme comme il y en a peu</quote>!</said> exclaimed
               <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>.</p>
               <p><said>Who will ever more have faith in the
               
               
               <foreign xml:lang="la">sortes Virgilanæ</foreign>?</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
                laughing: but whilst she laughed she
                went closer to a candle, to read the page
                which she had opened. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
                Hervey</persName> followed her. <said>Really, it
                is somewhat singular, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, that I
                should have opened upon this passage,</said>
                continued she in a low voice, pointing it
                out to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
               </p> 
               <p>It was a description of the manner in
                which <quote source="#marmontel_contes" xml:lang="fr">la femme comme il y en a peu</quote>
                 managed a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">husband</ecda:anonPers>, who was excessively
                 afraid of being thought to be governed by
                 his wife. As her ladyship turned over
                 the page, she saw a leaf of <ecda:flora>myrtle</ecda:flora> which
                  <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who had been reading the story
                   the preceding day, had put into the book
                   for a mark.
               </p>
               <p><said>Whose mark is this? Yours, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, I
               am sure, by it's elegance,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
               <said>So! this is a concerted plot between
               you two, I see,</said> continued her 
               ladyship with an air of pique—<said>you
               have contrived prettily <foreign xml:lang="fr">de me dires des
               verités</foreign>! One says, <said>Let us try our fate by
               the <foreign xml:lang="la">sortes <rs type="properAdjective">Virgilianæ</rs></foreign>:</said>—the other has
               dexterously put a mark in the book, to
               
               
               make it open upon a lesson for the naughty
               child.</said>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> and <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> assured her,
                that they had used no such mean arts—
                that nothing had been concerted between
                them.                   
               </p>
               <p><said>How came this leaf of <ecda:flora>myrtle</ecda:flora> here,
               then?</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.                   
               </p>  
               <p><said>I was reading that story yesterday,
               and left it as my mark.</said>                   
               </p>  
               <p><said>I cannot help believing you, because
               you have never yet deceived me, even
               in the merest trifle:—you are truth itself,
               <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.—Well, you can see that <emph>you</emph> were
               the cause of my drawing such an <choice><sic>exraordinary</sic><corr>extraordinary</corr></choice>
               lot; the book would not have
               opened here, but for your mark. My fate, 
               I find, is in your hands: if <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
               is ever to be <foreign xml:lang="fr">la femme comme il ye en a 
               peu</foreign>, which is the most <emph>improbable</emph> thing
               in the world, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> will be the
               cause of it.</said>                   
               </p>  
               <p><said>Which is the most probable thing in
               the world,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>. <said>This
               <ecda:flora>myrtle</ecda:flora> has a delightful perfume,</said> added 
               he, rubbing the leaf between his fingers.                   
               </p>
               <p><said>But, after all,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
                   
                   
               throwin aside the book, <said>this heroine of

               </p>  
               <p><said>How pleased the little gipsey looks!</said>
               added she, turning to <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, who heard

               looks when she is pleased!—Do these auburn
               locks of yours, <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, curl naturally
               or artificially?</said>
               </p>  
               <p><said>Naturally, mamma.</said></p>  
               <p><said>Naturally!—So much the better. So
               did mine at your age.</said>
              </p>  
              <p><ecda:persGroup>Some of the company</ecda:persGroup> now took notice
              of the astonishing resemblance between
              <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> and her mother; and the more
              <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> considered her daughter
               as a part of herself, the more she was inclined
               to be pleased with her. The glass
               globe containing the <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna> was put
               in the middle of the table at supper; and
               <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> never paid her ladyship
                  
                  
               such respectful attention in his life, as he
               did this evening.                  
              </p>   
              <p>The conversation at supper turned upon
              a magnificent and elegant entertainment
              which had lately been given by a fashionable
              <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="duchess">duchess</ecda:anonPers>, and some of the company
              spoke in high terms of the beauty and accomplishments
              of her grace's <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">daughter</ecda:anonPers>, 
              who had for the first time appeared in
              public on that occasion.                  
              </p>
              <p><said>The <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">daughter</ecda:anonPers> will eclipse, totally

              <said>That total eclips has been foretold by
              many knowing people,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>;
              <said>but how can there be an eclipse
              between two bodies which never cross one
              another?—and that I understand to be
              the case between the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="duchess" a-gender="female">duchess</ecda:anonPers> and her
              <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">daughter</ecda:anonPers>.</said>
              </p>  
              <p>This observation seemed to make a
              great impression upon <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.
              <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> went on, and with much
              eloquence expressed his admiration of the
              <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">mother</ecda:anonPers> who had stopped short in the career

             <p><said>Really, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
             rising from table, <said><foreign xml:lang="fr">vous parlez avec

             a sentimental comedy, a <foreign xml:lang="fr">comedie larmoyante</foreign>,
             or a drama on the <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs> model,

             <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> smiled at first at the

             she sighed bitterly. <said>It is too late

             she.                 
             </p>    
             <p><said>Too late?</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>, following
             her eagerly as she walkedo ut of the supper-room
             —<said>Too late?—<ecda:anonPers a-occupation="duchess" a-gender="female">Her grace of

             on to something else—Why were not you
             at the fête champêtre the other day? and
             
             
             where were you all this morning? And
             pray can you tell me when your friend

             <persName ref="#rx">doctor X―</persName> soon amongst us again. I
             hear that he is to be in town in the course

             </p>    
             <p><said>Did he inquire for me?—Did he ask

             </p>    
             <p><said>No. I fancy he took it for granted
             that your ladyship was quite well; for I
             told him you were getting better every

              <p><said>Yes,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but I
              wear myself out with these charming
              spirits. I am very nervous still, I assure
              you, and sitting up late is not good for 
              me. So I shall wish you and all the

             <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> hours after her ladyship had retired
             to her room, as <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was passing
             by the door, she heard <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> call to
             her.
             </p>   
             <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, you need not walk so softly,
             I am not asleep. Come in, will you, my
             dear? I have something of consequence
             to say to you. Is all the world gone?</said>                 
             </p>   
             <p><said>Yes; and I thought you were 
             asleep. I hope you are not in pain?</said>                 
             </p>   
            <p><said>Not just at present, thank you; but
            that was a terrible embrace of poor little
            <persName ref="#hd">Helena's</persName>. You see to what accidents I
            should be continually exposed, if I had
            that child always about me? and yet she
            seems of such an affectionate disposition,
            that I wish it were possible to keep her
            at home. Sit down by my bedside my
            
            
            
            dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! and I will tell you what I
            have resolved upon!</said>                
            </p>    
            <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> sat down, and <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
             was silent for some minutes.
            </p>    
            <p><said>I am resolved,</said> said she, <said>to make
            one desperate effort for my life. New
            plans, new hopes of happiness, have opened
            to my imagination, and, with my hopes
            of being happy, my courage rises. I am
            determined to submit to the dreadful operation
            which alone can radically cure me;
            —you understand me. But it msut be
            kept a profound secret.—I know of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">person</ecda:anonPers>
            who could be got to perform this operation
            with the utmost secrecy.</said>                
            </p>   
           <p><said>But surely,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>safety must
           be your first object!</said>
               </p>
           <p><said>No; secrecy is my first object. Nay,
           do not reason with me; it is a subject on
           which I cannot, will not, reason. Hear
           me—I will keep <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> with me for a
           few days; she was surprised by what
           passed in the library this evening; I must
           remove all suspicion from her mind.</said>               
           </p>
           <p><said>There is no suspicion in her mind,</said>
           said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>    
           </p>         
           <p><said>So much the better: she shall go immediately
           to school, or to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>.—
           
           
           I will then stand my trial for life or death;
           and if I live I will be, what I ahve never
           yet been, a mother to <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>. If I die,
           you and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> will take care of 
           her;—I know you will. That young man
           is worthy of you, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. If I die, I
           charge you to tell him, that I knew his 
           value; that I had a soul capable of being
           touched by the eloquence of virtue.</said>
           <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, after a pause, said, in an
               altered tone,
           </p>         
           <p><said>Do you thin, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, that I shall
           survive this operation?</said>               
           </p>         
           <p><said>The opinion of <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
            <said>must certainly be more satisfactory than mine;</said>  and she repeated what
            the doctor had left with her in writing
            upon this subject.
           </p>         
           <p><said>You see,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>That <persName ref="#rx">Dr.
           X―</persName> is by no means certain that you
           have the complaint which you dread.</said>               
           </p>         
           <p><said>I am certain of it,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
            with a a deep sigh. Then, after a
            pause, she resumed:
           </p>         
           <p><said>So it is the doctor's opinion, that I
           shall inevitably destroy myself, if, from a
           vain hope of secrecy, I put myself into
           ignorant hands? These are his own words,
           
           
           are they?—Very strong—and he is prudent
           to leave that opinion in writing.
           Now, whatever happens, he cannot be
           answerable for <quote rend="quotes">measures which he does <!-- quote source? -->
           not guide</quote>. Nor you either, my dear!—
           you have all done what is prudent and
           proper.—But I must beg you to recollect,
           that I am neither a child nor a fool; that
           I am come to years of discretion, and that
           I am not now in the delerium of a fever;
           consequently there can be no pretence for
           <emph>managing</emph> me. In this particular I must 
           insist upon managing myself. I have 
           confidence in the skill of the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">person</ecda:anonPers> whom
           I shall employ. <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>, very likely
           would have none, because the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">man</ecda:anonPers> may
           not have a diploma for killing or curing
           in form. That is nothing to the purpose.
           It is I that am to undergo the operation.
           It is <emph>my</emph> health, <emph>my</emph> life, that is risked;
           and if I am satisfied, that is enough.—
           Secrecy, as I told you before, is my first
           object.</said>               
           </p>         
           <p><said>And cannot you,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>depend
           with more security upon the honour
           of a <rs ref="#rx" type="person">surgeon</rs> who is at the head of his
           profession, and who has ahigh reputation
           at stake, than upon a vague promise of
           
           
           
           secrecy from some obscure <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">quack</ecda:anonPers>, who
           has no reputation to lose?</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>: <said>I tell you,
               my dear, that I cannot depend upon any
               of these <soCalled rend="quotes">honourable men</soCalled>. I have taken 
               means to satisfy myself on this point: their
               honour and foolish delicacy would not
               allow them to perform such an operation
               for a wife, without the knowledge, privity,
               consent, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. of her husband.
               Now <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> knowing the thing
               is quite out of the question.</said>              
           </p>
           <p><said>Why, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>! why?</said>
             said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, with great earnestness.
             <said>Surely a husband has the strongest
             claim to be consulted upon such an occasion!
             Let me entreat you to tell <persName ref="#md">lord
             Delacour</persName> your intentions, and then all
             will be right. Say <said rend="noquotes"><emph rend="italic">Yes</emph></said>, my dear friend!
             let me prevail upon you,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
             taking her ladyship's hand, and pressing
             it between both of hers with the most affectionate
             eagerness.
           </p>         
            <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> made no answer, but
             fixed her eyes upon <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
            </p>     
           <p><said><persName ref="#ld">Lord Delacour</persName>,</said> continued <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
            <said>deserves this from you, by the
            great interest, the increasing interest, that
            
            
            he has shown of late about your health;
            his kindness and handsome conduct the 
            other morning certainly pleased you; and
            you have now an opportunity of showing
            that confidence in him, which his affection
            and constant attachment to you
            merit.</said>   
           </p>      
           <p><said>I trouble myself very little about the
           constancy of <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> attachment
           to me,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, coolly withdrawing
           her hand from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>Whether
           his lordship's affection for me have of 
           late increased, or diminished, is an object
           of perfect indifference to me. But if I
           were inclined to reward him for his late
           attentions, I should apprehend that we
           might hit upon some better reward than
           you have pitched upon. Unless you imagine
           that <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> has a peculiar
           taste for surgical operations, I cannot conceive
           how his becoming my confidant
           upon this occasion could have an immediate
           tendency to increase his affection for
           me—about which affection I don't care a
           stra; as you, better than any one else,
           must know. For I am no hypocrite; I 
           have laid open my whole heart to you,
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.</said>               
           </p>      
                 
                 
          <p><said>For that very reason,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
          <said>I am eager to use the influence
          which I know I have in your heart, for
          your happiness. I am convinced that it
          will be absolutely impossible, that you
          should carry on this scheme in the house
          with your <rs ref="#md" type="person">husband</rs>, without it's being discovered.
          If he <emph>discover</emph> it by accident,
          he will feel very differetnly from what he 
          would do, if he were trusted by you.</said>
          </p> 
          <p><said>For Heaven's sake, my dear!</said> cried
           <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>let me hear no more
           about <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> feelings.</said>   
          </p>
          <p><said>But allow me to speak of my 
          own,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; <said>I cannot be concerned
          in this affair, if it is to be concealed
          from your <rs ref="#md" type="person">husband</rs>.</said>              
          </p> 
          <p><said>You will do about that as you think
          proper,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> haughtily.
          <said>Your sense of propriety towards <persName ref="#md">lord
          Delacour</persName> is, I observe, stronger than your
          sense of honour towards me. But I make
          no doubt that you act upon principle—just
          principle. You promised never to abandon
          me:—but when I most want your
          assistance, you refuse it, from consideration
          for <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>. A scruple of delicacy
          absolves a person of nice feelings,
          
          
          I find, from a positive promise!—A new
          and convenient code of morality!</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, though much hurt by the sarcastic
           tone in which <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs> spoke,
           mildly answered, <said direct="false">that the promise she
           had made to stay with her ladyship during
           her illness, was very different from an
           engagement to assist her in such a scheme
           as she now had in contemplation.</said>
          </p>          
          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> suddenly drew the curtain
           between her and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, saying,
           <said>Well, my dear! at all events, I am glad
           to hear you don't forget your promise of
           <emph>staying</emph> with me. You are, perhaps, prudent
           to refuse me your assistance—all

           have kept you up too long. Good night!</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said>Good night!</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, drawing
          aside the curtain. <said>You will not be displeased
          with me, when you reflect coolly.</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said>The light blinds me,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>;
          and she turned her face away 
          from <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, and added, in a
          drowsy voice, <said>I will <emph>think of what has
          been said</emph> some time or other: but just 
          now I would rather go to sleep, than say
          or hear any more: for I am more than
          half asleep already.</said>
          </p>    
                    
                    
           <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> closed the curtains, and left the
            room. But <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, notwithstanding
            the drowsy tone in which she pronounced
            these last words, was not in the
            least inclined to sleep. A passion had
            taken possession of her mind, which kept
            her broad awake the remainder of the
            night,—the passion of jealousy. The extreme
            eagerness with which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had 
            urged her to consult <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, and
            to trust him with her secet displeased 
            her; not merely as an opposition to her
            will, and undue attention to his lordship's
            feelings, but as <quote source="#shakespeare_othello">confirmation strong</quote> of 
            a hint which had been dropped by <persName ref="#pb">sir
            Philip Baddely</persName>, but which never till now
            had appeared to her worthy of a moment's
            consideration. <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName> had observed
            that <said direct="false">if a young lady had any hopes of
            being a viscountess, it was no wonder she
            thought a baronet beneath her notice.</said>—
            <said>Now,</said> thought <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>this
            is not impossible. In the first place, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda
            Portman</persName> is a nice to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>;
            she may have all her aunt's art, and the
            still greater art to conceal it under the
            mask of openness and simplicity: <quote rend="italic" xml:lang="it" source="#wotton_letter">Volto
            sciolto, pensieri stretti</quote>, is the grand maxim 
            
            
            
            of the <persName ref="#ss">Stanhope</persName> School.</said> The moment
            <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> mind turned to suspicion,
            her ingenuity rapidly supplied her
            with circumstances and arguments to confirm
            and justify her doubts.
           </p>         
          <said> <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> fears that my husband
           is growing too fond of me: she says, he
           has been very attentive to me of late. Yes,
           so he has; and on purpose to disgust him
           with me, she immediately urges me to tell
           him that I have a loathsome disease, and
           that I am about to undergo a horrid operation.
           How my eyes have been blinded 
           by her artifice! This last stroke was 
           rather too bold, and has opened them effectually,
           and now I see a thousand things
           that escaped me before. Even to-night,
           the <foreign xml:lang="la">sortes <rs type="properAdjective"><rs type="properAdjective">Virgilianæ</rs></rs></foreign>, the <ecda:flora>myrtle</ecda:flora> leaf, <persName ref="#bp">miss

           at the place where <persName ref="#jean_francois_marmontel_1723">Marmontel</persName> gives a receipt 
           for managing a husband of <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> 
           character. Ah, ah! By her own
           confession, she had been reading this;
           studying it. Yes, and she has studied it
           to some purpose; she has made that poor
           weak lord of mine think her an angel.
           How he ran on in her praise the other 
           day, when he honoured me with a morn-
           
           
           
           ing visit! That morning visit, too, was of
           her suggestion; and the bank notes, as 
           he, like a simpleton, let out in the course
           of the conversation, had been offered 
           to her first. She, with a delicacy that
           charmed my short-sighted folly, begged
           that they might go through my hands.
           How artfully managed! <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
           herself could not have done better. So,
           she can make <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> do whatever
           she pleases; and she condescends to make
           him behave <soCalled>prettily</soCalled> to me, and desires
           him to bring me peace-offerings of bank
           notes! She is, in fact, become my banker;
           mistress of my house, my husband, and 
           myself. Ten days I have been confined
           to my room. Truly, she has made a good
           use of her time; and I, fool that I am,
           have been thanking her for all her disinterested 
           kindness!
           </p>         
           <p rend="prequotes">Then her attention to my daughter!
           disinterested, too, as I thought!—But,
           Good Heavens, what an idiot I have
           been! She looks forward to be the
           mother-in-law of <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>; she would
           win the simple child's affections even
           before my face, and show <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>
           what a charming wife and mother she
           
           
           
           would make! He said some such thing
           to me, as well as I remember, the other
           day. Then her extreme prudence! She
           never coquets, not she, with any of
           <choice><sic>she</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> young men who come here on purpose
           to see her. Is this natural? Absolutely
           unnatural; artifice! artifice! To
           contrast herself with me in <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName>
           opinion is certainly her object.
           Even to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, with whom
           she was, or pretended to be, smitten,
           how cold and reserved she is grown of
           late; and how haughtily she rejected my
           advice, when I hinted that she was not
           taking the way to win him! I could not
           comprehened her; she had no designs on
           <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, she assured me. Immaculate
           purity! I believe you.

            and inuendoes, and references to some
            letter which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had written about
            my disputes with <rs ref="#md" type="person">my husband</rs>! from

            never let me see anothero f her aunt's 
            letters. So I may conclude they are all in
            the same style; and I make no doubt that
            she has instructed her niece, all this time
            how to proceed. Now I know why she
            always puts <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> letters into
             her pocket the moment she receives them,
             and never opens them in my presence.
             And I have been laying open my whole
            heart, telling my whole history, confessing
            all my faults and follies, to this girl! And
            I have told her that I am dying! I have
            taught her to look forward with joy and
            certainty to the coronet, on which she has
            fixed her heart.

               after passing several restless hours

               —it is not in human nature to be so

            in the breakfast room; and that he has 
            been talking to me this half hour—of
            what do you think?—of <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>. He was
            quite surprised, he said to see her grown
            such a fine girl, and he declares that he
            no longer regrets that she was not a boy;
            and he says that he will dine at home to-day,
            on purpose to drink <persName ref="#hd">Helena's</persName> health
            in his new <ecda:food>burgundy</ecda:food>, and, in short, I

          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> got up, and went down
          to breakfast, in much uncertainty what to
          think of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>; but ashamed to
          let her into her mind, and still more afraid
          that <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> should suspect her
          of doing him the honour to be jealous.—
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had not the least guess at what
          was really passing in her ladyship's heart;
          she implicitly believed her expressions of
          complete indifference to her lord; and
          jealous was the last feeling which <persName ref="#bp">miss
          Portman</persName> would have attributed to <persName ref="#ld">lady
          Delacour</persName>, because she unfortunately was
          not sufficiently aware that jealousy can
          exist without love. The idea of <persName ref="#md">lord 
          Delacour</persName>, as an object of attachment; or
          of a coronet, as an object of ambition; or
          of her friend's death, as an object of joy,
          were so foreign to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> innocent
          mind, that it was scarcely possible she
          could decipher <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> thoughts.

          that she had never felt so well since her
          illness, ordered her carrige as soon as

           who understands what is proper,

          </p>
          <p><persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName> was too much in the 
          habit of hearing sarcastic, and to him incomprehensible,
          speeches from her ladyship,
          to take any extraordinary notice
          of this;–and if <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> blushed, it was
          merely from the confusion into which
          she was thrown by the piercing glance
          of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> black eyes—a glance
          which neither guilt nor innocence could
          withstand. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> imagined that her

          from the conversation that had passed
          the preceeding night, and the first time
          that she was alone with <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
          she again touched upon the subject,
          in hopes of softening or convincing her.
          <said>At all events, my dear friend!</said> said 
          she, <said>you will not, I hope, be offended
          by the sincerity with which I speak—
          I <emph>can</emph> have no object but your safety and
          happiness.</said>
          </p>          
          <p><said>Sincerity never offends me,</said> was <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her
          ladyship's</rs> cold answer. And all the
          time that they were out together, she
          was unusually ceremonious to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>;
          and there would have been but
          
          
          
          little conversation, if <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> had not
          been present, to whom her mother talked
          with fluent gayety. When they got to
          <placeName>Spring-gardens</placeName>, <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> exclaimed, <said>O!
          there's <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival's</persName> carriage,
          and <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName> and <persName ref="#edward_percival_0001">Edward</persName> with her—
          They are going to the same place that
          we are, I dare say, for I heard <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>
          ask <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> to take him to see <persName ref="#henry_maillardet_1745">Maillardet's</persName>
          little <ecda:fauna>bird</ecda:fauna>—<persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> mentioned
          it to us, and he said it was a 
          curious piece of machinery.</said>
          </p>      
          <p><said>I wish you had told me sooner that <persName ref="#ap">lady
          Anne</persName> was likely to be there, I don't wish
          to meet her so awkwardly—I am not
          well enough yet, indeed, to go to these
          odious, hot, close places; and, besides,
          I hate seeing sights.</said>            
          </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, with much good humour, said
           that she would rather give up seeing
           the sight than be troublesome to her
           mother.—When they came to <persName ref="#henry_maillardet_1745">Maillardet's</persName>,
           however, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> saw <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Mrs.
           ―</ecda:anonPers> getting out of her carriage, and to
           her she consigned <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>,
           saying, that she would take a turn or 
           two in the park, and call for them in half 
           an hour. When the half hour was over,
           
           
           
           and <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs> returned, she carelessly
           asked, as they were going home, whether
           they had been pleased with their visit to
           the <ecda:fauna>bird</ecda:fauna> and the <rs type="person" ref="#henry_maillardet_1745">conjurer</rs>. <said>O, yes,
           mamma!</said> said <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>: <said>and do you
           know, that one of the questions that the
           people ask the conjurer is <quote rend="italic"><said>Where is the
           happiest family to be found?</said></quote> And <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>
           and <persName ref="#edward_percival_0001">Edward</persName> immediately said, if he is
           a good conjurer, if he tells truth, he'll
           answer <quote rend="italic"><said>At <placeName>Oakly-Park</placeName></said></quote>.</said>              
          </p>  
          <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>, have you had any conversation
          with <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>?</said> said
          <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> coldly.    
          </p>          
          <p><said>A great deal,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>and
          such as I am sure you would ahve liked:
          and so far from being a ceremonious
          person, I think I never saw any body
          who had such engaging manners.</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said>And did she ask you, <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, again
          to go with her to that place where the
          happeist family in the world is to be
          found?</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said><placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>?—No, mamma; she said
          that she was very glad that I was with
          you; but she asked <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> to
          come to see her whenever it was in her
          power.</said>              
          </p> 
                    
                    
          <p><said>And could <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> withstand
          such a temptation?</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said>You know that I am engaged to your
          ladyship,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.              
          </p>          
          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> bowed. <said>But from
          what passed last night,</said> said she, <said>I
          was afraid thaty ou might repent your
          engagement to me: and if so, I give up
          my bond. I should be miserable if I
          apprehended that any one, but more 
          especially <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, felt herself a
          prisoner in my house.</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said>Dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>! I do not feel
          myself a prisoner; I have always till now
          felt myself a friend in your house; but 
          we'll talk of this another time. Do not
          look at me with so much coldness; do
          not speak to me with so much politeness.
          I will not let you forget, that I am your
          friend.</said>              
          </p>          
          <p><said>I do not wish to forget it, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,</said>
          said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, with emotion; <said>I
          am not ungrateful, though I may seem
          capricious—bear with me.</said>  
          </p>         
          <p><said>There now, you look like yourself
          again, and I am satisfied,</said> cried <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.
          <said>As to going to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>, I give you
          my word that I have not the most distant
          
          
          
          thoughts of it. I stay with you from choice,
          and not from compulsion, believe me.</said>    
          </p>        
          <p><said>I <emph>do</emph> believe you,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           and for a moment she was convinced
           that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was with her for her
           own sake alone; but the next minute she
           suspected, that <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> was the 
           secret cause of her refusing to go to
           <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>. His lordship dined at home
          this day, and two or three succeeding 
          days, and he was not intoxicated from
          Monday till Thursday. These circumstances
          appeared to his lady very extraordinary.
          In fact, he was pleased and 
          amused with his little daughter, <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>;
           and whilst she was yet almost a stranger
           to him, he wished to appear to her in the
           most agreeable and respectable light possible.
           One day after dinner, <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>,
           who was in remarkably good humour,
           said to her ladyship—<said>My dear! you
           know that your new <ecda:commodity>carriage</ecda:commodity> was broken
           almost to pieces the night when you
           were overturned. Well, I have had it all
           set to rights again, and new painted,a nd
           it is all complete, except the hammer-
           cloth, which must have the new fringe.
           What colour will you have the fringe?</said>              
          </p>      
                
                
          <p><said>What do you say, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?</said>
           said <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship.</rs>
          </p>      
          <p><said>Black and orange would look well,
          I think,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> <said>and would suit
          the lace of your liveries—would not it?</said>              
          </p>      
          <p><said>Certainly—Black and orange then,</said>
           said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, <said>it shall be.</said>
          </p>      
          <p><said>If you ask my opinion,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady
          Delacour</persName>, <said>I am for blue and white, to
          match the cloth of the liveries.</said>             
          </p>
          <p><said>Blue and white then it shall be,</said> said
           <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.
          </p>
          <p><said>Nay, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> has a better taste
          than I have; and she says black and
          orange, my lord.</said>              
          </p>
          <p><said>Then you'll have it black and orange,
          will you?</said> said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.              
          </p>      
          <p><said>Just as you please,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           and no more passed.
          </p>      
          <p>Soon afterward a note came from <persName ref="#ap">lady
          Anne Percival</persName>, with some trifles belonging
           to <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, for which her mother had
           sent. The note was for <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>—another
           pressing invitation to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>—and a
           very civil message from <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret
           Delacour</persName>, and thanks to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           for the <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>. Ay, thought <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> wants to ingratiate 
              
              
           herself in time with all my husband's relations.
           <said><persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName> should
           have addressed these thanks to you, <persName ref="#bp">miss
           Portman</persName>, for I had not the grace to think
           of sending her the macaw.</said> <persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName>,
           who was very fond of his aunt, immediately
           joined his thanks, and observed
           that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> was always considerate
           —always obliging—always kind. Then
           he drank her health in a bumper of <ecda:food>burgundy</ecda:food>,
           and insisted upon his little <persName ref="#hd">Helena's</persName>
           drinking her health. <said>I am sure
           you ought, my dear! for <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> is
           very good—too good to you, child.</said>
          </p>      
           <p><said>Very good—not too good, I hope,</said>
            said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>. <said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>,
            your health.</said>
           </p>   
           <p><said>And I hope</said>, continued <rs type="person" ref="#md">his lordship</rs>,
            after swallowing his bumper, <said>that my
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName> does not mean to enveigle
            you away from us, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
            You don't think of leaving us, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
            I hope? Here's <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> would break
            her little heart;—I say nothing for my
            <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, because she can say every
            thing so much better for herself; and I
            say nothing for myself, because I am the
            worst man in the world at making
            
            
            
            speeches, when I really have a thing at
            heart—as I have your staying with us,
            <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.</said>
           </p>
           <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> assured him, that there was no
           occasion to press her to do what was
           perfectly agreeable to her, and said that 
           she had no thoughts of leaving <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.
            Her ladyship, with some embarrassment,
            expressed herself <said>extremely
            obliged, and gratified, and happy</said>
            <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, with artless joy, threw her arms
            about <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, and exclaimed, <said>I am
            glad you are not going!—for I never
            liked any body so much, of whom I knew
            so little.</said>
           </p>
           <p><said>The more you know of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, 
           the more you will like her, child—
           at least I have found it so,</said> said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.
           </p>
           <p><said><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> would, I am sure,
           have given the <ecda:commodity><persName ref="#george_pigot_1719">Pigot</persName> diamond</ecda:commodity>, if it were
           in his gift, for such a smile as you bestowed 
           on <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> just now,</said> whispered
           <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.—For an instant <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
            was struck with the tone of pique
            and reproach, in which her ladyship spoke.
            <said>Nay, my dear! I did not mean to make
            
            
            
            you blush so piteously,</said> pursued her ladyship:
            <said>I really did not think it a blushing 
            matter—but you know best. Believe
            me, I spoke without malice; we are so
            apt to judge from our feelings—and
            I could as soon blush about the old man of
            the mountains as about my <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.</said>
           </p>
           <p><said><persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName>!</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, with
           a look of such unfeigned surprise, that
           <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs> instantly changed countenance,
           and, taking her hand with gayety,
           said <said>So, my little <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! I have
           caught you—the blush belongs then to
           <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>? Well, any man of
           common sense would rather have one
           blush than a thousand smiles, for his
           share—Now we understand one another
           And will you go with me to the exhibition
           to-morrow? I am told there are some
           charming pictures this year. <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>,
           who really has a genius for drawing,
           should see these things; and whilst she <emph>is</emph>
           with me, I will make her as happy as 
           possible. You see the reformation is beginning
           —<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
           can do wonders. If it be my fate,
           at last, to be <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">la bonne mère</foreign>, or <quote source="#marmontel_contes" xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">la femme
           
           
           
           comme il y en a peu</quote>, how can I help it?
           There is no struggling against fate, my
           dear!</said> 
           </p>  
           <p>Whenever <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> suspicions
           of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> were suspended, all her affections
           returned with double force; she
           wondered at her own folly, she was
           ashamed that she could have let such ideas
           enter her mind, and she was beyond
           measure astonished tat any thing relative 
           to <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> could so far have interested
           her attention. <said>Luckily,</said> said
           she to herself, <said>he has not the penetration
           of a <ecda:fauna>blind beetle</ecda:fauna>; and, besides, he
           has little snug jealousies of his own; so
           he will never find me out. It would be
           an excellent thing indeed, if he were to
           turn my <quote rend="quotes" source="#middleton_hengist"><emph>master-torment</emph></quote> against myself—
           it would be a judgment upon me. The
           <foreign xml:lang="la">manes</foreign> of poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> would then be appeased.
           But it is impossible I should ever
           be a jealous wife: I am only a jealous
           friend, and I must satisfy myself about 
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. To be a second time a dupe to
           the treachery of a friend, would be too
           much for me—too much for my pride—
           too much for my heart.</said>               
           </p>
                    
                    
                    
            <p>The next day, when they came to the
            exhibition, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had an opportunity
            of judging <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> real feelings.
            As they went up the stairs, they
            heard the voices of <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName> and
            <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName>, who were standing upon
            the landing-place, leaning over the banisters,
            and running their little sticks along
            the iron rails, to try which would make
            the loudest noise.                
            </p>
            <p><said>Have you been much pleased with the
            pictures, gentlemen?</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
            as she passed them.    
            </p>
           <p><said>O, damme! no; 'tis a cursed bore;—
           and yet there are some fine pictures: one
           in particular—hey, <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>? one damned
           fine picture!</said> said <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>: And the two
           <ecda:persGroup ref="#philip_baddely #rochfort_0001">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>, laughing significantly, followed
           <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> into the
           rooms.               
           </p>         
            <p><said>Ay, there's one picture that's worth
            all the rest, 'pon honour!</said> repeated <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>;
             <said>and we'll leave it to your <rs type="person" ref="#ld">ladyship's</rs> 
             and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> taste and judgment
             to find it out;—Mayn't we, <persName ref="#pb">sir
             Philip</persName>?</said>                
            </p>        
             <p><said>O, damme! yes,</said> said <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, <said>by
             
             
             
             all means.</said> But he was so impatient to
             direct her eyes, that he could not keep
             himself still an instant.                 
             </p>       
             <p><said>O, curse it! <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, we'd better
             tell the ladies at once, else they may be
             all day looking and looking!</said>                 
             </p>       
             <p><said>Nay, <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, may not I be allowed
             to guess? Must I be told which is your
             fine picture?—This is not much in favour 
             of my taste.</said>                 
             </p>       
              <p><said>O damn it! <rs type="person" ref="#ld">your ladyship</rs> has the best
              taste in the world, every body knows;
              and so has <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>—and this picture
              will hit her taste particularly, I'm sure.
              It is <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> fancy; but this
              is a dead secret—dead—<persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName> no more
              thinks we know it than the man in
              the moon.</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><said><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> fancy!—Then I
              make no doubt of it's being good for
              something,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>if the
              painter have done justice to his imagination;
              for <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> has really a fine imagination.</said>                  
              </p>      
               <p><said>O, damme! 'tis not amongst the history
               pieces,</said> cried <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>; <said>'Tis a
               portrait.</said>
               </p>     
               <p><said>And a history piece, too, 'pon ho-
               
               
               nour?</said> said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>:—<said>a family history
               piece, I take it, 'pon honour! it will
               turn out,</said> said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>; and both the
               <ecda:persGroup ref="#philip_baddely #rochfort_0001">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> were, or affected to be, thrown
               into convulsions of laughter, as they repeated
               the words, <said>family history piece,
               —'pon honour! family history piece,
               damme!</said>                   
               </p>     
               <p><said>I'll take my oath as to the portrait's
               being a devilish good likeness,</said> added <persName ref="#pb">sir
               Philip</persName>; and as he spoke, he <persName ref="#pb">miss
               Portman</persName>—<said><persName ref="#pb">Miss Portman</persName> has it! damme!
               <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> has him!</said>                   
               </p>     
               <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> hastily withdrew her eyes from
                the picture at which she was looking.—
               <said>A most beautiful creature!</said> exclaimed
                <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.   
               </p>     
               <p><said>O, faith! yes—I always do <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName> the
               justice to say, he has a damned good taste
               for beauty.</said>—<said>But this seems to be foreigh
               beauty,</said> continued <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
               <said>if one may judge by her air, her dress
               and the scenery about her—<ecda:flora>cocoa-trees</ecda:flora>,
               <ecda:flora>plantains</ecda:flora>—<persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, what think
               you?</said>                   
               </p>     
               <p><said>I think,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> (but her voice 
               faltered so much that she could hardly
               speak), <said>that it is a scene from <title ref="saint_pierre_virginie_0001"><persName ref="#paul_0001">Paul</persName> and
               
               
                   <persName ref="#virginia_de_la_tour_0001">Virginia</persName></title>. I think the figure is <persName ref="#bernardin_de_saint_pierre_1737">St. Pierre's</persName>
                   <title><persName ref="#saint_pierre_virginie_0001">Virginia</persName></title>.</said>                   
               </p>     
               <p><said><persName ref="#vs">Virginia St. Pierre</persName>! ma'am,</said> cried
               <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName>, winking at <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>.
               <said>No, no, damme! there you are wrong,
               <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, said <persName ref="#ch">Hervey's</persName> <persName ref="#vs">Virginia</persName>, and then
               you have it, damme! or, may be, <persName ref="#vs">Virginia
               Hervey</persName>,who knows?</said>    
               </p>     
               <p><said>This is a portrait,</said> whispered the <rs type="person" ref="#pb">baronet</rs>
                to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence's</persName>
                mistress.</said> Whilst her ladyship leant her
                ear to this whisper, which was sufficiently
                audible, she fixed a seemingly careless,
                but most observing, inquisitive eye upon
                poor <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. Her confusion, for she heard
               the whisper, was excessive.
               </p>     
               <p><said>She loves <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>—she has
               not thoughts of <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> and his
               coronet—I have done her injustice,</said>
               thought <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, and instantly she
               dispatched <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName> out of the room, for
                a catalogue of the pictures, begged <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr.
                Rochfort</persName> to get her something else, and,
                drawing <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> arm within hers,
                she said, in a low voice, <said>Lean upon me,
                my dearest <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! depend upon it,
                <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> will never be such a fool as to
                
                
                marry the girl—<persName ref="#vs">Virginia Hervey</persName> she will 
                never be!</said>
               </p>     
               <p><said>And what will become of her? can
               <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> desert her? she looks like innocence
               itself! and so young too! Can he
               leave her for ever to sorrow, and vice, and
               infamy?</said> thought <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, as she kept
                her eyes fixed, in silent anguish, upon the
                picture of <persName ref="#vs">Virginia</persName>:—<said>No, he cannot do
                this; if he could he would be unworthy
                of me, and I <emph>ought</emph> to think of him no
                more; No; he will marry her; and I
                <emph>must</emph> think of him no more</said>
               </p>     
               <p>She turned abruptly away from the picture,
                   and she saw <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> standing
                   beside her.                  
               </p> 
               <p><said>What do you think of this picture<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">?</unclear>
               Is it not beautiful? We are quite enchanted 
               with it; but you do not seem to be 
               struck with it, as we were at the first
               glance.</said>                   
               </p>
               <p><said>Because,</said> answered <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, gayly,
                <said>it is not the first glance I have had at
                that picture—I admired it yesterday, and
                admire it to-day.</said>                   
               </p>   
               <p><said>But you are tired of admiring it, I
               see. Well, we shall not force you to be
               
               
               
               
               in raptures with it—shall we <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?
               A man may be tired of the most
               beautiful face in the world, or the most
               beautiful picture; but really there is so
               much sweetness, so much innocence, such
               tender melancholy in this countenance,
               that, if I were a man, I should inevitably
               be in love with it, and in love for ever!
               Such beauty, if it were in nature, would
               certainly fix the most inconstant man
               upon earth.</said>                   
               </p>     
               <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> ventured to take her eyes for
               an instant from the picture, to see whether
               <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> looked like the
                most inconstant man upon earth. He
                was intently gazing upon her; but as soon
                as she looked up, he suddenly exclaimed,
                as he turned to the picture—                   
               </p>     
               <p><said>A heavenly countenance indeed!—
               the painter has done justice to the poet.</said>
              </p>
              <p><said>Poet!</said> repeated <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>: <said>the
              man's in the clouds!</said>
              </p>
              <p><said>Pardon me,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>; <said>does
                  not <persName ref="#bernardin_de_saint_pierre_1737">M. de St. Pierre</persName> deserve to be called
              a poet? Though he does not write in 
              rhyme, surely he has a poetical imagination?</said>                  
              </p> 
                    
                    
                    
              <p><said>Certainly,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>;—and from
               the composure with which <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
               now spoke, she was suddenly inclined to
               believe, or to hope, that all <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName>
                  story was false. <said><persName ref="#bernardin_de_saint_pierre_1737">M. de St. Pierre</persName> undoubtedly
               has a great deal of imagination,
               and deserves to be called a poet.</said>
              </p>      
              <p><said>Very likely, good people!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady
              Delaocur</persName>: <said>but what has that to do with
              the present purpose?</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><said>Nay,</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> <said><rs type="person" ref="#ld">your ladyship</rs>
                  certainly sees that this is <persName ref="#bernardin_de_saint_pierre_1737">St. Pierre's</persName>
              <title><persName ref="#virginie_de_la_tour_0001">Virginia</persName></title>?</said>                  
              </p>      
             <p><said><persName ref="#bernardin_de_saint_pierre_1737">St. Pierre's</persName> <title><persName ref="#virginie_de_la_tour_0001">Virginia</persName></title>!—O, I know
              who it is, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, as well as you do. I
              am not quite so blind, or so stupid, as you
              take me to be.</said> Then recollecting her
              promise, not to betray <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName> secret,
              she added, pointing to the landscape of
              the picture—<said>These <ecda:flora>cocoa trees</ecda:flora>, this
              fountain, and the words <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">Fontaine de <persName ref="#virginie_de_la_tour_0001">Virginie</persName></foreign>,
              inscribed on the rock—I must
              have been stupidity itself, if I had not
              found it out. I absolutely <emph>can</emph> read, <persName ref="ch">Clarence</persName>,
              and spell, and put together.—But
              here comes <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>, who, I
              believe, cannot read, for I sent him an
              
              
              
              
              hour ago for a catalogue, and he pores
              over the book as if he had not yet made
              out the title.</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName> had purpously delayed, because
                  he was afraid of rejoining <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
                 whilst <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was with
                  her, and whilst they were talking of the
                  picture of <persName ref="#vs">Virginia</persName>.
              </p>      
              <p><said>Here's the catalogue; here's the picture
                  your ladyship wants—<persName ref="#bernardin_de_saint_pierre_1737">St. Pierre's</persName>
              <title><persName ref="#virginia_de_la_tour_0001">Virginia</persName></title>;—damme! I never heard of that
              fellow before; he is some new painter;
              damme! that is the reason I did not know
              the hand.—Not a word of what I told
              you, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—you won't blow us
              to <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName>,</said> added he <emph>aside</emph> to her ladyship.
              <said><persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName> keeps aloof; and so will
              I, damme!</said>
              </p>      
              <p>A <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">gentleman</ecda:anonPers> at this instant beckoned
               to <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> with an air of great eagerness.
               <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> went and spoke to him:
               then returned with an altered countenance,
               and apologized to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
               for not dining with her, as he had promised.
               Business, he said, of great importance,
               required that he should leave 
               town immediately.—<persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> had just
               taken <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> into a little room,
                  
                  
               where <persName ref="#richard_westall_1765">Westal's</persName> drawings were hung, to
               show her a group of <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>
               and her <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">children</ecda:persGroup>; and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was alone
               with the little girl, when <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
               came to bid her adieu. He was in much 
               agitation.
              </p>      
              <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>, I shall not, I am
              afraid, see you again for some time;—perhaps
              I may never have that—hem!—happiness.
              I had something of importance, 
              that I wished to say to you before I left
              town; but I am forced to  go so suddenly,
              I can hardly hope for any moment but the
              present to speak to you, madam. May I
              ask whether you purpose remaining much
              longer with <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>?</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><said>Yes;</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, much surprised,
               <said>I believe—I am not quite certain—but
               I believe I shall stay with <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs>
               some time longer.</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> looked painfully embarrassed,
              and his eyes involuntarily fell upon
              little <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>. <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> drew her hand
              gently away from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, left the room,
              and retired to <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her mother</rs>.
              </p>      
              <p><said>That <rs type="person" ref="#hd">child</rs>, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, is very
              fond of you,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Again
              he paused, and looked round, to see whe-
              
              
              ther he could be overheard. <said>Pardon me
              for what I am going to say.—This is not a 
              proper place.—I must be abrupt; for I am
              so circumstanced, that I have not a moment's
              time to spare. May I speak to you
              with the sincerity of a friend?</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><said>Yes. Speak to me with sincerity,</said>
              said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>and you will deserve that
              I should think you my friend.</said> She
              trembled excessively, but spoke and
              looked with all the firmness that she
              could command.
              </p>      
              <p><said>I have heard a report,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>,
              <said>which was most injurious to you.</said>
              </p>      
              <p><said>To me!</said></p>      
              <p><said>Yes. No one can escape calumny. It 
              is whispered, that if <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> should
              die—</said>                  
              </p>  
              <p>At the word <mentioned rend="italic">die</mentioned>, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> started.                  
              </p>      
              <p><said>That if <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> should die,
              <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> would become the mother
              of <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>!</said>                  
              </p>      
              <p><said>Good Heavens! what an absured report!
              Surely <emph>you</emph> could not for an instant
              believe it, <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>?</said>                  
              </p>      
               <p><said>Not for an instant. But I resolved, as
               soon as I heard it, to mention it to you;
               for I believe that half the miseries of the
               
               
               
               world arise from foolish mysteries–from
               the want of courage to speak the truth.
               Now that you are upon your guard, your
               own prudence will defend you sufficiently.
               I never saw any of your sex, who appeared
               to me to have so much prudence, and
               so little art—But farewell—I have not a 
               moment to lose,</said> added <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, suddenly
               checking himself; and he hurried
               away from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who stood fixed to
               the spot where he left her, till she was
               roused by the voices of <ecda:persGroup>several people</ecda:persGroup> 
               who came into the room to see the drawings.
               She started as if from a dream, and
               went immediately in search of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.
               </p>     
               <p><persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip Baddely</persName> was in earnest conversation
               with her ladyship; but he stopped 
               speaking when <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> came within
               hearing, and <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> turned to 
               <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, and said, <said>My dear, if you are
               satisfied, for mercy's sake let us begone,
               for I am absolutely overcome with heat
               —and with curiosity,</said> added she in a low 
               voice to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>—<said>I long to hear how
               <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> likes <persName ref="#richard_westall_1765">Westal's</persName> drawings.</said>                   
               </p>     
                <p>As soon as they got home, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
                sent <rs type="person" ref="#hd">her daughter</rs> to practise a new
                    
                
                lesson upon the harpsichord. <said>And now
                sit down, my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>?</said> said she,
                <said>and satisfy my curiosity. It is the curiosity
                of a friend, not of an impertinent
                busy-body. Has <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> declared himself?
                He chose an odd time and place;
                but that is of no matter, I forgive him,
                and so do you, I dare say. But why do you
                tear that unfortunate <ecda:flora>carnation</ecda:flora> to pieces?
                Surely you cannot be embarrassed in
                speaking to me! What's the matter? I 
                once did tell you, that I would not give
                up my claim to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence's</persName> adorations
                during my life—But I intend to live a
                few years longer after the amazonian
                operation is performed, you know—And
                I could not have the conscience to keep
                you waiting whole years. It is better to
                do things with a good grace, lest one
                should be forced at last to do them with
                an ill grace. Therefore I give up all maner
                of claim to every thing but—flattery!
                that of course you will allow me from
                poor <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>. So now do not begin upon
                another <ecda:flora>flower</ecda:flora>; but, without any further
                superfluous modestly, let me hear all the 
                pretty things <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> said or swore.</said>

                <p>Whilst <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was pulling the <ecda:flora>carnation</ecda:flora>
                 to pieces, she recollected what <persName ref="#ch">Mr.

                 his words still sounded in her ear. <quote rend="italic"><said>I

                Was it worth while to pull that

                 —Bad policy!—Never, whilst you live,

                 with the beginning, the middle, or the
                 end of it. How could I suspect you of
                 such false taste? I really imagined these

                 but I beg pardon for giving you these elements
                 of criticism. I assure I interrupt

                 I am here.</said>                     
                 </p> 
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><said>And that <emph>I</emph> am not here, <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>;
                  for I must be gone to dress.</said></p>
                  <p>She rose hastily to leave the room, but
                   <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> caught her hand—<said>You
                   won't go, I hope, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said> said
                   she, <said>till I have finished my long story?</said>
                  </p>
                  <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> sat down again, ashamed
                   of her own embarrassment, when she saw
                   that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was so calm and composed.
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this be art, innocence, or assurance,
                      thought she, I cannot tell; but
                      we shall see.                      
                  </p>
                  <p><persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName> now came in, with a 
                      half-unfolded newspaper, and a packet of 
                      letters in his hand. He came to apologize
                      to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> for having, by mistake,
                      broken the seal of a letter to her,
                      which had been sent under cover to him.
                      He had simply asked <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, whether
                      the <ecda:persGroup ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">ladies</ecda:persGroup> were at home, that he might not
                      have the trouble of going up stairs if they 
                      were out. <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Monsieur Champfort</persName> possessed,
                      in an eminent degree, the mischievous art
                      of appearing mysterious about the simplest
                      things in the world. 
                  </p>
                  <p><said>Though I was so thoughtless as to
                  break the seal before I looked at the direction
                  of the letter,</said> said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>,
                      
                      
                  <said>I assure you I went no farther than the
                  three first words; for I knew <quote rend="quotes">my dear 
                  niece</quote> could not possibly mean me.</said> He
                   gave <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> the letter, and left the
                   room. This explanation was perfectly
                   satisfactory to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; but <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
                   prejudiced by the hesitation of 
                   <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, could not help suspecting,
                   that this letter was merely the ostensible
                   cause of his lordship's visit.                      
                  </p>
                  <p><said>From my <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>, said <persName ref="#bp">miss
                  Portman</persName>, as she opened her letter. She
                  folded it up again after glancing over the 
                  first page, and put it into her pocket, colouring 
                  deeping.</said>                      
                  </p>  
                  <p>All of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> suspicions about
                   <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> epistolary counsels and
                   secrets instantly returned with almost the
                   force of conviction to her mind.
                  </p>  
                  <p><said>Miss Portman,</said> said she, <said>I hope
                  your politeness to me does not prevent
                  you from reading your letter? Some ceremonious
                  people think it vastly rude to
                  read a letter in company; but I am not
                  one of them: I can write whilst you read,
                  for I have fifty notes and more to answer.
                  So pray read your letter at your ease.</said>                      
                  </p>  
                  <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had but just unfolded her letter
                  again, when <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> returned,
                  followed by <persName ref="#champfort">Champfort</persName>, who brought with
                   him a splendid hammer-cloth.

                  <p><said>Very handsome, upon my word!</said>
                  said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> coldly, and she fixed
                  her eyes upon the fringe, which was black
                  and orange—<said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman's</persName> taste, I

                  </p>

                  <p><rs ref="#md" type="person">His lordship</rs> declared he did not know

                   was convinced that it was done on purpose.

                  </p>  
                  <p>Dissembling her displeasure, she praised

              your last. But you should never trust
              unnecessarily in this manner to the post
              —always, when you are obliged to send
              bank notes by post, cut them in two,
              and send half by one post and half by
              another. This is what is done by all prudent
              people. Prudence, whether in trifles
              or in matters of consequence can be learned
              only by experience (which is often too
              dearly bought)—or by listening, which costs
              nothing, to the suggestions of those who
              have a thorough knowledge of the world.                 
             </p>    
              <p rend="prequotes">A report has just reached me concerning
              you and <emph>a certain lord</emph>, which
              gives me the most heartfelt concern. I
              always knew, and told you, that you were
              <emph>a great favourite</emph> with the person in ques-
                  
                  
              tion. I depended on your prudence,
              delicacy, and principles, to understand
              this hint properly, and I trusted that you
              would conduct yourself accordingly. It 
              is too plain (from the report alluded to)
              that there has been some misconduct
              or mismanagement somewhere. The
              misconduct I cannot—the mismanagement
              I must attribute to you, my dear.
              For, let a man's admiration for any woman
              be ever so great, unless she suffer
              herself to be dazzled by vanity, or unless 
              she be naturally of an inconsiderate
              temper, she can surely prevent his partiality
              from becoming so glaring as to excite
              envy. Envy is always to be dreaded 
              by handsome young women, as being,
              sooner or later, infallibly followed by
              scandal—Of this I fear you have not
              been sufficiently aware, and you see the
              consequences—consequences which, to
              a female of genuine delicacy or of real
              good sense, must be extremely alarming.
              —Men of contracted minds and cold
              tempers, who are absolutely incapable
              of feeling generous passion for our sex,
              are often unaccountably ambitious to
              gain the reputation of being <emph>well</emph> with
                  
              
              any woman whose beauty, accomplishments,
              or connexions, may have brought
              her into fashion. Whatever affection
              may be pretended, this is frequently the
              <emph>ultimate</emph> and <emph>sole</emph> object of these selfish
               creatures. Whether or not the person
               I have in my eye deserves to be included
               in this class, I will not presume positively to determine; but you, who have
               personal opportunities of observation,
               may decide this point (if you have any
               curiosity on the subject) by oserving
               whether he most affects to pay his devoirs
               to you in public or in private. If
               the latter be the case, it is the most 
               dangerous: because a man even of the
               most contracted understanding has always
               sense, or instinct, enough to feel
               that the slightest taint in the reputation
               of the woman who is, or who is to be,
               his wife, would affect his own private
               peace, or his honour in the eyes of the
               world. A husband who has,  in a first
               marriage, been, as it is said, in constant
               fear both of matrimonial subjugation
               and disgrace, would, in his choice of a
               second lady, be peculiarly nice, and
               probably <emph>tardy</emph>. Any degree of favour
                  
                  
               that might have been shown him, any
               report that may have been raised, and
               above all, any restraint he might feel
               himself under from implied engagement,
               or from the discovery or reputation of
               superior understanding and talents in the
               object beloved, would operate infallibly
               against ter, to the confusion of all
               her plans, and the ruion at once of her
               reputation, her peace of mind, and her
               hopes of an establishment.—Nay, supposing 
               the best that could possibly happen
               —that, after playing with the utmost 
               dexterity this desperate game, the pool
               were absolutely your own; yet, if there
               were any suspicions of unfair play buzzed
               about amongst the by-standers, you
               would not in the main be a gainer; for,
               my dear, without character, what is even
               wealth, or all that wealth can bestow?—
               I do not mean to trouble you with stale
               wise sayings, which young people hate,
               nor musty morality, which is seldom
               fit for use in the world, or which smells
               too much of books to be brought into
               good company. This is not my way of
               giving advice;—but I only beg you to observe
               what actually passes before your
               
               
               eyes in the circle in which we live.—
               Ladies of the best families, with rank
               and fortune, and beauty and fashion,
               and every thing in their favour, cannot
               (as yet in this country) dispense with
               the strictest observance of the rules of
               virtue and decorum. Some have fancied 
               themselves raised so high above
               the vulgar as to be in no danger from
               the thunder and lightning of public
               opinion: but these ladies in the clouds
               have found themselves mistaken: they
               have been blasted, and have fallen nobody 
               knows where!—What is become
               of <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="lady">lady ―</ecda:anonPers>, and the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="countesss">countess of ―</ecda:anonPers>,
                and others I could mention, who were
                as high as envy could look?—I remember
                seeing the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="countess">countess of —</ecda:anonPers>, who
                  was then the most beautiful creature
                  my eyes ever beheld, and the most admired
                  that was ever heard of, come into
                  the <placeName>Opera-house</placeName>, and sit the whole night
                  in her box without any woman's speaking
                  or curtseying to her, or taking any
                  more notice of her than you would of
                  a post, or a beggar woman.—Even a
                  cornet cannot protect a woman, you
                  see, from disgrace: if she falls, she and it,
                  
                  
                  and all together are trampled under foot.
                  —But why should I address all this to
                  my dear niece? Whither have the terrour
                  and confusion I was thrown into by this
                  strange report about you and <rs ref="#md" type="person">lord ―</rs>
                  led me?—And yet one cannot be too
                  cautions—<quote rend="quotes" xml:lang="fr">Ce n'est que le premier <emph>mot</emph>
                  qui coute</quote>—Scandal never stops after <!-- does this have a source? -->
                  the first word, unless she be instantly
                  gagged bya dexterous hand. Nothing
                  shall be wanting on my part, but you
                  alone are the person who can do any
                  thing effectiual. Do not imagine that I
                  would have you quit <rs type="person" ref="#ld">lady ―</rs>; that is
                  the first idea, I know, that will come into
                  your silly little head, but put it out directly.
                  If you were upon this attack to quit
                  the field of battle, you yield the victory
                  to your enemies. To leave <rs ref="#ld" type="person">lady ―'s</rs>
                  house would be folly and madness. As 
                  long as she is your friend, or <emph>appears</emph>
                  such, all is safe; but any coolness on
                  her part would, in the present circumstances,
                  be death to your reputation.
                  And even if you were to leave her on
                  the best terms possible, the malicious
                  world would say that you left her on the
                  worst, and would assign as a reason the
                  
                  
                  
                  report alluded to. People who have not 
                  yet believed it, would then conclude that
                  it must be true; and thus, by your cowardice,
                  you would furnish an incontrovertible 
                  argument against your innocence.
                  I therefore desire that you will not, upon
                  any acocunt, think of coming home to me
                  at present: indeed, I hope your own good
                  sense would prevent you from wishing it,
                  after the reasons that I have given. Far
                  from quitting <rs type="person" ref="#ld">lady ―</rs> from false delicacy,
                  it is your business, from consideration
                  for her peace, as well as your own, to redouble
                  your attentions to her in private,
                  and, above all things, to appear as much 
                  as possible with her in public. I am
                  glad to hear her health is so far re-established,
                  that she <emph>can</emph> appear again in public
                  —her spirits, as you hint, will be
                  the better for a little amusement. Luckily,
                  you have it completely in your power
                  to convince her and all the world of the
                  correctness of your mind, I believe I
                  certainly should have fainted, my dear,
                  when I first heard this shocking report,
                  if I had not just afterward received a 
                  letter from <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName> which revived
                  me. His proposal at this crisis
                  
                  
                  
                  for you, my dear, is a charming thing.
                  You have nothing to do but to encourage
                  his addresses immediately,—the report
                  dies away of itself,—and all is just 
                  as your best friends wish. Such an establishment 
                  for you, my dear, is indeed
                  beyond their most sanguine expectations.
                  <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName> hints in his letter, that
                  my influence might be wanting with you
                  in his favour—But this surely cannot be.
                  As I have told him, he has merely mistaken
                  becoming female reserve for a want
                  of sensibility on your part, which would
                  be equally unnatural and absured. Do you
                  know, my dear, that <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>
                  has an estate of <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifteen thousand</measure> a year
                  in <placeName>Wiltshire</placeName>? and his <persName ref="#barton_0001">uncle Barton's</persName>
                  estate in <placeName>Norfolk</placeName> will, in due time, pay
                  his debts. Then, as to family—look in the 
                  list of baronets in your pocketbook; and
                  surely, my love, an old baronetage in actual
                  possession is worth something more
                  than the reversion of a new coronet—
                  supposing that such a thinkg could properly
                  be thought of, which Heaven forbid!
                  —So I see no possible objection to
                  <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! and I am
                  sure you have too much candour and
                  
                  
                  good sense to make any childish or romantic
                  difficulties. <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName> is not, I
                  know, a man of what you call genius. So
                  much the better, my dear!—Those men
                  of genius are dangerous husbands; they
                  have so many oddities and eccentricities
                  there is no managing them, though they
                  are mighty pleasant men in company
                  to enliven conversation. for example,
                  your favourite <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>. As it
                  is well knwon he is not a marrying man,
                  you never can have a thought of him.—
                  You are not a girl, to expose yourself
                  to the ridicule, &amp;c. of all your female
                  acquaintance by romance and nonsense.
                  I cannot conceive that a niece of mine
                  could degrade herself by a mean prepossession
                  for a man, who has never
                  made any declaration of his attachment
                  to her, and who, I am sure, feels no
                  such attachment. That you may not
                  deceive yourself, it is fit I should tell 
                  you, what otherwise it might not be so
                  proper to mention to a young lady, that
                  he keeps, and has kept a mistress for
                  some years; and those who are most intimately
                  in his confidence have assured
                  me, that, if ever he marries any body, he
                  
                  
                  will marry this girl; which is not impossible,
                  considering that she is, they say, 
                  the most beautiful young creature that
                  ever was seen, and he <quote rend="italic">a man of genius</quote>.
                  If you have any sense or spirit, I have said
                  enough.—So adieu!—Let me hear, by
                  return of the post, that every thing is
                  going on as it should do. I am impatient
                  to write to your <persName ref="#tollemache_0001">tollemache</persName> this
                  good news. I always foretold, that my
                  <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> would marry better than her sister,
                  or any of her <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">cousins</ecda:persGroup>, and take place
                  of them all. Are you not obliged to me
                  for sending you this winter to town to
                  <rs ref="#ld" type="person">lady ―</rs>? It was an admirable hit.
                  Pray tell <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, with my best
                  compliments, that our <rs ref="#luttridge _0001" type="person"><emph ana="#flora">aloe</emph> friend</rs> (her
                  ladyship will understand me) cheated a
                  <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">gentleman</ecda:anonPers> of my acquaintance the other 
                  day, at casino, out of <measure ana="#commodity #currency">seventy guineas</measure>.
                  He hates the sight of her odious red wig
                  as much now as we always did. I knew,
                  and told <persName ref="#ld">lady D―</persName>, as she will do me
                  the justice to remember, that <rs type="person" ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. ―</rs>
                  cheated at play.—What a contemptible
                  character!—Pray, my dear, do not forget
                  to tell <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, that I have a
                  charming anecdote for her, about another
                  
                  
                  
                  <rs type="person" ref="#hf"><emph>friend</emph></rs> of ours, who has lately gone over
                  to the enemy. Has her ladyship seen a
                  manuscript that is handed about as a great
                  secret, and said to be by <ecda:anonPers>―</ecda:anonPers>, a parallel
                  between <rs ref="#hf" type="person"><emph>our friend</emph></rs> and the <persName ref="#chevalier_deon_1728">chevalier
                  d'Eon</persName>? It is done with infinite wit and
                  humour, in the manner of <persName ref="#plutarch_46">Plutarch</persName>. I
                  would send a copy, but I am afraid my
                  frank would be too heavy if I began upon
                  another sheet.—So once more adieu, my
                  dear niece! Write to me without fail, and
                  mention <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>. I have written to
                  him to give my approbation, &amp;c.

           turned over the sheets of her aunt's 
           long epistle. She did not attempt to
           read it regularly through: some passages 
           here and there were sufficient to astonish
           and shock her extremely. <said>No bad
           news, I hope?</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           again looking up from her writing at <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
            who sat motionless, leaning her head
            upon her hand, as if deep in thought—
            
            
            <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> unfolded letter hanging
               from her hand. In the midst of the variety
               of embarrassing, painful, and alarming
               feelings excited by this letter, she had
               sufficient strength of mind to adhre to
               her resolution of speaking the exact truth
               to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>. When she was roused
               by her ladyship's question, <quote><said>No bad 
               news, I hope, miss Portman?</said></quote> she instantly 
               answered, with all the firmness 
               she could command:
           </p>     
           <p><said>Yes. <rs type="person" ref="#ss">My aunt</rs> has been alarmed by
           a strange report which I heard myself
           for the first time this morning from <persName ref="#ch">Mr.

           to him for having the courage to speak
           the truth to me.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p>Here she repeated what <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
             had said to her.
           </p>     
           <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> never raised her eyes
               whilst <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> spoke, but went on
               scratching out some words in what she 
               was writing. Through the mask of paint
               which she wore, no change of colour
               could be visible; and as <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> did not
               see the experssion of her ladyship's eyes
               she could not in the least judge of what
               was passing in her mind.               
           </p>     
                
                
          <p><said><persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> has acted like a man of

          <said>but it is a pity, for your sake, he did
          not speak sooner—before this report became
          so public—before it reached <placeName>Bath</placeName>,
          and <rs type="person" ref="#ss">your aunt</rs>. Though it could not surprise
          her much—she has such a perfect
          knowledge of the world,—and—</said>
          </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> uttered these broken
              sentences in a voice of suppressed anger;
              cleared her throat several times and at
              last, unable to speak, stopped short—and
              then began with much precipitation to put
              wafersinto several notes that she had been
              writing. So it has reached bath?—
              thought she—The report is public!—I
              never till now heard a hint of any such
              thing except from <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddey</persName>; but
              it has doubtless been the common talk of
              the town, and I am laughed at as a dupe
              and an idiot, as I am. And now, when
              the thing can be concealed no longer, she
              comes to me with that face of simplicity,
              and, knowing my generous temper, throws
              herself on my mercy, and trusts that her
               speaking to me with this audicious plainness
               will convince me of her innocence.
               <said>You have acted in the most prudent
               
               
               
               manner possible, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,</said> said her
              ladyship, as she went on sealing her notes,
              <said>by speaking at once to me of this strange,
              scandalous, absurd report. Do you act
              from your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope's</persName> advice, or entirely
              from your own judgment akd knowledge 
              of my character.</said>
          </p>      
          <p><said>From my own judgment and knowledge 
          of your character, in which I hope
          —I am not—I cannot be mistaken,</said> said
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, looking at her with a mixture of
          doubt and astonishment.
          </p>      
          <p><said>No—you calculated admirably—
          'twas the best, the only thing you could
          do—Only,</said> said <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs>, falling
          back in her chair with an hysteric laugh,
          <said>only the blunder of <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, and the
          entrance of <persName ref="#md">my lord Delacour</persName>, and the
          <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">hammer-cloth</ecda:commodity> with the orange and black
          fringe. Forgive me, my dear! for the soul
          of me I can't help laughing! it was rather
          unlucky; so awkward, such a contretemps!
          But you,</said> added she, wiping her
          eyes, and recovering from laughter, <said>you
          have such admirable presence of mind,
          nothing disconcerts you! You are equal to
          all situations, and stand in no need of such
          long letters of advice from your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stan-
          
          
          hope</persName>,</said> pointing to the two folio sheets
           which lay at <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> feet. 
          </p>      
          <p>The rapid, unconnected manner in
              which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> spoke, the hurry of
              her motions, the quick, suspicious, angry
              glances of her eye, her laugh, her unintelligible
              words, all conspired at this moment
              to give <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> the idea that her intellects
              were suddenly disordered. She was so
              firmly persuaded of her ladyship's utter
              indifference to <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, that she
              never conceived the possibility of her being
              actuated by the passion of jealousy—by 
              the jealousy of power—a species of jealousy
              which she had never felt, and could
              not comprehend. But she had sometimes
              seen <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> in starts of passion that
              seemed to border on insanity, and the idea
              of her losing all command of her reason
              now struck <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> with irresistible force
              —She felt the necessity for preserving her
              own composure; and with all the calmness
              that she could assume, she took up
              her <rs type="person" ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope's</rs> letter, and looked
              for the passage in which <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>
              and <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> were mentioned. If i
              can turn the course of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> 
              mind, thought she, or catch her attention,
              
              
              perhaps she will recover herself. <said>Here
              is a message to you, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!</said>
              cried she, <said>from my <rs ref="#ss" type="person">aunt Stanhope</rs>,
              about—<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>.</said>
          </p>     
          <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman's</persName> hand trembled as she
              turned over the pages of the letter. <said>I
              am all attention,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady D―</persName> with a
              composed voice; <said>only take care don't
              make a mistake: I am in no hurry, don't 
              read any thing <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> might not
              wish. It is dangerous to garble letters,
              almost as dangerous to snatch them out
              of a friend's hand, as I once did, you
              know—but you need not now be under
              the least alarm.</said>              
          </p>      
          <p>Conscious that this letter was not fit
              for her ladyship to see, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> neither
              offered to show it to her, nor attempted
              any apology for her reserve and embarrassment,
              but hastily began to read the
              message relative to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, her
              voice gaining confidence as she went on,
              as she observed that she had fixed <persName ref="#ld">lady
              Delacour's</persName> attention, who now sat listening
              to her, calm and emotionless. But
              when <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> came to the words,
              <quote>Do not forget to tell <persName ref="#ld">lady D―</persName>, that I
              have a charming anecdote for her about
              
              
              another <emph>friend</emph> of hers, who lately went
              over to the enemy,</quote>—her ladyship exclaimed
              with great vehemence,
          </p>      
           <p><said><emph>Friend!</emph>—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>!—Yes—
           like all other friends—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>!—
           What was she compared to?—'Tis too
           much for me—too much!</said>—and she put
           her hand to her head.
           </p>     
           <p><said>Compose yourself, my dear <emph>friend</emph>!</said>
            said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, in a calm gentle tone; and
               she went toward her with an intention of
               soothing her by caresses: but, at her approach,
               <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> pushed the table on
               which she had been writing from her with
               violence; started up, flung back the veil
               which fell over hre face as she rose, and
               darted upon <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> a look, which fixed
               her to the spot where she stood. It said,
               <said>Come not a step nearer, at your peril<sic>?</sic></said>
               <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> blood ran cold—she had no
               longer any doubt that this was insanity.
               She shut the pen-knife which lay upon the
               table, and put it in her pocket.
           </p>     
            <p><said>Cowardly creature!</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
             and her countenance changed to
             the expression of ineffable contempt—
             <said>what is it you fear?</said>
            </p>    
                
                
            <p><said>That you should injure yourself.—
            Sit down—For heaven's sake listen to me,
            to your friend, to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>!</said>                
            </p>    
            <p><said>My friend! my <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>!</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady
            Delacour</persName>, and she turned from her, and
            walked away some steps in silence; then
            suddenly clasping her hands, she raised
            her eyes to Heaven with a fervent but
            wild expression of devotion, and exclaimed—                
            </p>    
            <p><said>Great God of Heaven! my punishment
            is just. The death of <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> is
            avenged.—May the present agony of my
            soul expiate my folly!—Of guilt—deliberate
            guilt—of hypocrisy—treachery—I 
            have not—O never may I have—to repent!</said>                
            </p>    
            <p>She paused—her eys involuntariy returned
                upon <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>Oh <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>!—
                You! whom I have so loved! so trusted!</said>                
            </p>    
           <p>The tears rolled fast down her painted
            cheeks; she wiped them hastily away,
            and so roughly, that her face became a
            strange and ghastly spectacle. Unconscious
            of her disordered appearance, she
            rushed past <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who vainly attempted
            to stop her, threw up the sash, and
            
            
            stretching herself far out of the window, 
            gasped for breath. <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> drew
            her back, and closed the window, saying,
            <said>The roughe is all off your face, my dear
            <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!—you are not fit to be seen.
            Sit down upon this sofa, and I will ring
            for <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName>, and get some fresh rouge.
            Look at your face in the glass—you
            see—</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>I see,</said> interrupted <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
            looking full at <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>that she who I
            thought had the noblest of souls has the
            meanest!—I see that she is incapable of
            feeling.–<quote><emph>Rough! not fit to be seen!</emph>!</quote>—At
            such a time as this, to talk to me in this
            manner!—O niece of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>!—
            dupe!—dupe that I am!</said> she flung herself
            upon the sofa, and struck her forehead
            with her hand violently several times.
            Belinda, catching her arm, and holding it
            with all her force, cried in a tone of authority—
           </p>     
           <p><said>Command yourself, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!
           I conjure you, or you will go out of your
           senses; and if you do, your secret will be
           discovered by the whole world.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>Hold me not—you have no right,</said>
            cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, struggling to free her
               
            
            hand. <said>All powerful as you are in this
            house, you have no longer any power over
            me!—I am not going out of my senses!
            —You cannot get me into <placeName>Bedlam</placeName>, all
            powerful, all artful, as you are. You have 
            done enough to drive me mad—but I am
            not mad.—No wonder you cannot believe
            me—No wonder you are astonished at the
            strong expression of feelings that are foreign 
            to your nature—no wonder that you
            mistake the writhings of the heart, the
            agony of a generous soul, for madness!
            Look not so terrified, I will do you no injury.
            Do not you hear that I can lower
            my voice?–do not you see that I can be
            calm?—Could <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> herself—
            could <emph>you</emph>, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, speak in a
            softer, milder, more polite, more proper
            tone than I do now?—Are you pleased,
            are you satisfied?</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>I am better satisfied—a little better
           satisfied,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.               
           </p>     
           <p><said>That's well,—but still you tremble.
           There's not hte least occasion for apprehension
           —You see I can command myself,
           and smile upon you.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>O, do not smile in that horrid manner.</said></p>   
            
            
           <p><said>Why not?—Horrid!—Don't you
           love deceit?</said>               
           </p>         
            <p><said>I detest it from my soul.</said>                
            </p>        
            <p><said>Indeed!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, still 
            speaking in the same low, soft, unnatural
            voice—<said>Then why do you practise it,
            my love?</said>
            </p>        
            <p><said>I never practised it for a moment—I
            am incapable of deceit.—When you are
            <emph>really</emph> calm, when you can <emph>really</emph> command
            yourself, you will do me justice, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>;
            but now it is my business, if I
            can, to bear with you.</said>
           </p>        
           <p><said>You are goodness itself, and gentleness,
           and prudence personified.—You
           know how perfectly to <emph>manage</emph> a friend,
           whom you fear you have driven just to
           the verge of madness. But tell me, good,
           gentle, prudent <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, why need
           you dread so much that I should go mad?
           You know, if I went mad, nobody would
           mind, nobody would believe whatever I
           say—I should be out of your way sufficiently,
           shouldn't I?—And you would 
           have all the power in your own hands,
           would not you?—And would not htis be
           
           
           almost as well as if I were dead and
           buried?—No. Your calculations are better 
           than mine. The poor mad wife would
           still be in your way, would yet between
           you and the fond object of your secret
           soul—a coronet!</said>               
           </p>   
           <p>As she pronounced the word <mentioned rend="italic">coronet</mentioned>,
            she pointed to a coronet set in diamonds
            on her <ecda:commodity>watch-case</ecda:commodity>, which lay on the table.
            Then suddenly seizing the watch, she
            dashed it upon the marble hearth with
            all her force—<said>Vile bauble!</said> cried she,
            <said>must I lose my only friend for such a
            thing as you? Oh <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! do not you
            see that a coronet cannot confer happiness?</said>
           </p>
           <p><said>I have seen it long:—I pity you from
           the bottom of my soul,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
           bursting into tears.</p>
           <p><said>Pity me not. I cannot endure your
           pity, treacherous woman!</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           and she stamped with a look of
           rage—<said>most perfidious of women!</said>
           </p>    
          <p><said>Yes, call me perfidious, treacherous,
          —stamp at me—say, do what you will;
          I can and will bear it all—and patiently;
          for I am innocent, and you are mistaken
          
          
          and unhappy,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>You will
          love me when you return to your senses,
          then how can I be angry with you!</said>              
          </p>
          <p><said>Fondle me not,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           starting back from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> carresses—
           <said>Do not degrade yourself to no purpose
           —I never more can be your dupe—Your
           protestations of innocence are wasted on
           me—I am not so blind as you imagine—
           Dupe as you think me, I have seen much
           in silence. The whole world, you find,
           suspects you now.—To save your reputation,
           you want my friendship—you
           want—</said>
          </p>
         <p><said>I want nothing from you, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
         said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>—<said><quote rend="italic">You have suspected
         me long in silence</quote>—Then I have mistaken
         your character, I can love you no
         longer—Farewell for ever!—Find another
         —a better friend.</said>             
         </p>
         <p>She walked away from <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
            with proud indignation; but, before she
            reached the door, she recollected her
            promise to remain with this unfortunate
            woman.
         </p>
         <p>Is a dying woman, in the paroxysm of
             insane passion, a fit object of indignation?
             thought <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, and she stoped short.—
             
             
             —<said>No, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said> cried she,
             <said>I will not yield to my humour—I will
             not listen to my pride. A few words said
             in the heat of passion shall not make me
             forget myself or you. You have given
             me your confidence, I am grateful for it.
             I cannot—will not desert you—my promise
             is sacred.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Your promise!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           contemptuously, <said>I absolve you from
           your promise. Unless you find it <soCalled rend="italic">convenient</soCalled>
           to yourself to remember it, pray
           let it be forgotten; and if I must 
           die—</said>
         </p>
         <p>At this instant, the door opened suddenly,
          and little <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> came in singing—

         flutter, and never spoke to me—I'd lay
         my life this is, some way or other, <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr.
         Champfort's</persName> doings. But, good dear <persName ref="#bp">miss
         Portman</persName>, can you leave my poor lady
         when she wants you so much—and I'll
         take upon me to say, ma'am, loves you so
         much at the bottom of her heart? —Dear
         me, how your face is flushed!—Pray let
         me pack up these things, if it must be.
         But I do hope, if it be possible, that you
         should stay.—However, I've no business
         
         
         to speak. I beg pardon for being so impertinent;
         I hope you won't take it ill, it
         is only from regard to my poor lady I ventured
         to speak.</said>             
         </p>
        <p><said>Your regard to your lady deserves
        the highest approbation, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said> said
        <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>It is impossible that I should
        stay with her any longer. When I am
        gone, good <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, and when her health
        and strength decline, your fidelity and
        your service will be absolutely necessary
        to <rs type="person" ref="#ld">your mistress</rs>; and from what I have
        seen of the goodness of your heart, I am
        convinced that the more she is in want of
        you, the more <emph>respectful</emph> will be your
        attention.</said>    
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> answered only by her tears,
        and went on packing up in a great hurry.
        </p>
         <p>Nothing could equal <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
         astonishment, when she learnt from <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
         that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> was actually preparing
         to leave the house. After a moment's 
         reflexion, however, she persuaded
         herself that this was only a new artifice
         to work upon her affections; that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         did not mean to leave her; but that she
         would venture all lengths, in hopes of
         being at the last moment pressedd to stay.
         
         
         Under this persuasion, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> resolved
         to disappoint her expectations;
         she determined to meet her with that
         polite coldness, which would best become
         her own dignity, and which, without infringing
         the laws of hospitality, would
         effectually point out to the world, that
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was no dupe, and that <persName ref="#bp">miss
         Portman</persName> was an unwelcome inmate in her
         house. 
         </p>
          <p>The power of assuming gayety, when
           her heart was a prey to the most poignant
           feelings, she had completely acquired
           by long practice. With the promptitude
           of an actress she could instantly appear
           upon the sage, and support a character
           totally foreign to her own. The loud
           knocks at the door, which announced the
           arrival of company, were signals that
           operated punctually upon her associations;
           and to this species of conventional necessity
           her most violent passions submitted
           with magical celerity. Fresh rouged, and
           elegantly dressed, she was performing her
           part to a brilliant audience in her drawing-
           room, when <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> entered. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> beheld
           her with much astonishment, but
           more pity.

          will do no such cruel thing. I am, with
          all due humility, so confident of the irresistible

          defy <placeName>Oakly-mark</placeName> and all it's charms.—So,
          <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, instead of adieu, I shall

          </p>
          <p><said>Adieu, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
          with a look and tone which struck her
          ladyship to the heart. All her suspicions,
          all her pride, all her affected gayety vanish-
          
          
          ed; her presence of mind forsook her,
          and for some moments she stood motionless
          and powerless. Then recollecting 
          herself, she flew after <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> abruptly,
          stopped her at the head of the
          stairs, and exclaimed,
          </p>
          <p><said>My dearest <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, are you gone?—

          <p><said>Adieu!</said> repeated <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. It was
         all she could say; she broke from <persName ref="#ld">lady

         with the strongest feeling of compassion
         for this unhappy woman, but with an unaltered 
         sense of the propriety and necessity
         of her own firmness.

              <p><persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne Percival</persName> could not avoide
               suspecting, that something disagreeable
               had passed between <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and
               <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; but she was not troubled with

               who dined with her, to refrain from

              </p>  
              <p>The prejudice which <rs ref="#margaret_delacour_0001" type="person">this lady</rs> had conceived
              against her heroine, as being a niece
              of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> had lately been vanquished
              by the favourable representations
              of her conduct which she had heard from
              <rs ref="#md" type="person">her nephew</rs>, and by the kindness that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
              had shown to little <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>.

              <p><said>Madam,</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, addressing

              me, as one of <persName ref="#md">my lord Delacour's</persName> nearest
              relations now living, to return you my

              for the happiness of his family. 
              My little <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, I am sure, feels her
                  
              obligations towards you, and I rejoice that

              in person, my sense of what our family
              owes to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. As to the rest,
              her own heart will reward her. The praise
              of the world is but an inferior consideration.
              However, it deserves to be mentioned,
              as an instance of the world's candour,
              and for the singularity of the case,
              that every body agrees in speaking well
              even of so handsome a young lady as <persName ref="#bp">miss

              </p>       
              <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, with equal pleasure and surprise,
               observed that all this was said sincerely,
               and that the report, which she had 
               feared was public, had never reached <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs.
               Delacour</persName> or <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>.                  
              </p> 
              <p>In fact, it was known and believed only
               by those who had been prejudiced by the
               malice or folly of <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>.
               Piqued by the manner in which his addresses
               had been received by <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, he
               readily listened to the comfortable words
               of his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="valet">valet de chambre</ecda:anonPers>, who assured him
                  
               
               that he had it from the best possible authority
               (<persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> own gentleman,
               <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr. Champfort</persName>,) that his lordship was
                deeply <emph>taken</emph> with <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>—that the
                young lady managed every thing in the
                house—that she had been very prudent,
                to be sure, and had refused large presents
                —but that there was no doubt of her becoming
                <name>lady Delacour</name>, if ever his lordship
                should be at liberty. <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName> was the
                person who mentioned this to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence 
                Hervey</persName>, and <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName> was the person
                who hinted it to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>, in the
                very letter which he wrote to implore her 
                influence in favour of his own proposal.
                This manœuvring lady represented this
                report as being universally known and
                believed, in hopes of frightening her niece
                into an immediate match with the baronet.
                In the whole exten of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
                politic imagination, she had never forseen 
                the possibility of her niece's speaking
                the simple truth to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, and
                she had never guarded against this danger.
                She never thought of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mentioning
                this report to her ladyship, because
                she would never have dealt so openly, had
                she been in the place of her niece. Thus
                
                
                her art and falsehood operated against her
                own views, and produced consequences
                diametrically opposite to her expectations.
                —It was her exaggerations that made <persName ref="#ld">lady
                Delacour</persName> believe, when <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> repeated
                what she had said, that this report was 
                universally known and credited; her own
                suspicions were by these means again
                awakened, and her jealousy and rage were
                raised to such a pitch, that, no longer mistress
                of herself, she insulted her friend
                and guest. <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> was then obliged
                to do the very thing that <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
                most dreaded; to leave <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
                house and all it's advantages. As
                to <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> never
                thought of him from the moment she read
                her aunt's letter, till after she had left her
                ladyship; her mind was firmly decided
                upon this subject; yet she could not help
                fearing, that her aunt would not understand
                her reasons, or approve her conduct.
                She wrote to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> in the most
                kind and respectful manner; assured her
                that there had been no foundation whatever
                for the report, which had produced
                so much uneasiness; that <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>
                had always treated her with politeness and
                
                
                good nature, but that such thoughts or
                views as had been attributed to him, she
                was convinced had never entered his lordship's
                mind; that hearing of the publicity
                of this report had, however, <emph>much affected</emph>
                <persName ref="#ld">lady D―</persName>. <quote rend="quotes">I ahve, therefore,</quote> said
                <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <quote rend="quotes">thought it prudent to quit her

                I hope, my dear aunt, that you will not

                as it is entirely out of my power to return
                his partiality. Of his character, temper,
                and manners, I know enough to be convinced,
                that our union could tend only
                to make us both miserable. After what

               her own sentiments with firm sincereity,
               touched as slightly as she could,

               aunt, to whom she was under obligations.
               She was tempted to pass over in silence
               
               
               all that part of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> letter,
               which related to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>; but
               upon reflection, she determined to conquer
               her repugnance to speak of him, and 
               to make perfect sincerity the steady rule
               of her conduct. She therefore acknowledged
               to her aunt, that of all the persons 
               she had hitherto seen, this gentleman was
               the most agreeable to her; but at the
               same time she assured her, that the refusal 
               of <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName> was totally independent
               of all thoughts of <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
               —that, before she had received her aunt's
               letter, circumstances had convinced her
               that <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> was attached to another
               woman. She concluded by saying, that
               she had neither romantic hopes nor wishes,
               and that her affections were at her own
               command.

              <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> received the following angry

                and are now useless lumber on my hands;
                and she never could have had <persName ref="#joddrell_0002">Joddrell</persName>

                to me, and takes no manner of notice of
                me. But this is no matter, for he notice
                can be of no consequence now to any body.
                <persName ref="#levit_0002">Levit</persName> has run out of every thing he had in

                have the assurance to come to me in her

                <p>The regret which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> felt at having
                 grievously offended her aunt was somewhat
                 alleviated by the reflection, that
                 she had acted with integrity and prudence.
                 Thrown off her guard by anger, <persName ref="#ss">Mrs.
                 Stanhope</persName> had inadvertently furnished her
                 niece with the best possible reasons
                 
                 
                 against following her advice with regard
                 to <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>, by stating that her
                 site and cousins, who had married with
                 mercenary views, had made themselves
                 miserable, and had shown their aunt
                 neither gratitude nor respect.                   
                </p>
                <p>The tranquility of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mind was
                gradually restored by the society that she
                enjoyed at <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>. She found herself 
                in the midst of a large and cheerful family,
                with whose domestic happiness she could
                not forbear to sympathise. There was an
                affectionate confidence, an unconstrained 
                gayety in this house, which forcibly struck
                her, from it's contrast with what she had 
                seen at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>. She perceived,
                that between <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName> and <persName ref="#ap">lady
                Anne</persName> there was an union of interests,
                occupations, taste, and affection. She was
                at first astonished by the openness with
                which they talked of their affairs in her
                presence; that there were no family secrets,
                nor any of those petty mysteries which
                arise from a discordance of temper or
                struggle for power. In conversation,
                every person expressed without constraint
                their wishes and opinions; and whenever
                these differend, reason and the general
                
                good were the standards to which they
                appealed. The elder and younger part
                of the family were not separated from
                each other; even the youngest child in
                the house seemed to form part of the
                society, to have some share and interest
                in the general occupations or amusements.
                The children were were treated neither as
                slaves nor as playthings, but as reasonable 
                creatures; and the ease with which
                they were managed and with which
                they managed themsevles, surprised <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>;
                for she heard none of that 
                continual lecturing which goes forward
                in some houses, to the great fatigue and
                misery of all the parties concerned, and
                of all the spectators. Without force or any
                facetious excitements, the taste for knwledge,
                and the habits of application, were
                induced by example, and confirmed by
                sympathy. <persName ref="#henry_percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName> was a man of
                science and literature, and his daily pursuits
                and general conversation were in the 
                happiest manner of instructive and interesting
                to his family. His knowledge of the
                world, and his natural gayety of disposition,
                rendered his conversation not only
                useful, but in the highest degree amusing.
                
                
                From the merest trifles he could lead to
                some scientific fact, some happy literary
                allusion, or philosophical investigation.
                </p>
               <p><persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne Percival</persName> had, without any
                pedantry or ostentation, much accurate
                knowledge, and ataste for literature,
                which made her the chosen companion
                of her husband's understanding, as well
                as of his heart. He was not obliged to reserve
                his conversation for friends of his
                own sex, nor was he forced to seclude
                himself in the pursuit of any brance of
                knowledge; the partner of his
                most serious occupations; and her sympathy 
                and approbation, and the daily
                sense of her success in the education of
                their children, inspired him with a degree 
                of happy social energy, unknown to
                the selfish solitary votaries of avarice and
                ambition.                   
               </p> 
             <p>In this large and happy family there
                 was a variety of pursuits. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">One of the
                 boys</ecda:anonPers> was fond of chemistery, <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">another</ecda:anonPers> of
                 gardening; <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">one of the daughters</ecda:anonPers> had a
                 talent for painting, <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">another</ecda:anonPers> for music;
                 and all their acquirements and accomplishments
                 contributed to increase their 
                 
                 
                 mutual happiness, for there was no envy
                 or jealousy amongst them.                
             </p>   
             <p>Those who unfortunately have never
                 enjoyed domestic happiness, such as
                 we have just described, will perhaps
                 suppose the picture to be visionary and
                 romantic; there are others,—it is hoped
                 many others,—who will feel that it is
                 drawn from truth and real life. Tastes
                 that have been vitiated by the stimulus of 
                 dissipation might, perhaps, think these
                 simple pleasures insipid.                 
             </p>
             <p>Every body must ultimately judge of
                 what makes them happy, from the comparison
                 of their own feelings in different
                 situations. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was convinced by
                 this comparison, that domestic life was
                 that which could alone make her really 
                and permanently happy. She missed
                 none of the pleasures, none of the gay
                 company, to which she had been accustomed
                 at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>. She was
                 conscious at the end of each day, that
                 it had been agreeably spent; yet there
                 were no extraordinary exertions made to
                 entertain her, every thing seemed in it's
                 natural course, and so did her mind.
                 Where there was so much happiness, no
                 
                 
                 
                 want of what is called <distinct rend="italic">pleasure</distinct> was ever
                 experienced. She had not been at <placeName>Oakly-
                 park</placeName> a week, before she forgot that it 
                 was within a few miles of <placeName>Harrogate</placeName>, 
                 and she never once recollected her vicinity
                 to this fashionable water-drinking
                 place for a month afterward.                 
             </p>   
             <p><said>Impossible!</said> some young ladies will
                 exclaim. We hope other will feel, that it
                 was perfectly natural. But to deal fairly
                 with our readers, we must not omit to
                 mention a certain <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, who
                 came to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> during the first
                 week of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> visit, and who stayed
                 there during the whole succeeding month
                 of felicity. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> was a cerole;
                 he was about two-and-twenty; his person
                 and manners were striking and engaging;
                 he was tall, and remarkably
                 handsome; he had large dark eyes, an
                 aquiline nose, fine hair, and a manly sunburnt
                 complexion; his countenance was
                 open and friendly, and when he spoke
                 upon any interesting subject it lighted up,
                 and became full of fire and animation.
                 He used much gesture in conversation;
                 he had not yet the common manners of
                 young men who are, or who aim at
                 
                 
                 
                 
                 being thought, fashionable, but he was
                 perfectly at ease in company, and all that 
                 was uncommon about him appeared foreign.
                 He had a frank ardent temper,
                 incapable of art or dissimulation, and so
                 unsuspicious of all mankind, that he
                 could scarcely believe falsehood existed
                 in the world, even after he had himself
                 been it's dupe. He was in extreme
                 astonishment at the detection of any
                 species of baseness in a <emph>gentleman</emph>; for he
                 considered honour and generosity as 
                 belonging indefeasibly, of not exclusively,
                 to the priviliged orders. His notions of
                 virtue were certainly aristocratic in the
                 extreme, but his ambition was to entertain
                 such only as would best support and
                 dignify an aristocracy. His pride was
                 magnanimous, not insolent; and his social
                 prejudices were such as, in some degreee,
                 to supply the place of the power
                 and habit of reasoning, in which he was
                 totally deficient. One principle of philosophy
                 he practically possessed in perfection;
                 he enjoyed the present, undisturbed
                 by any unavailing regret for the past, or
                 troublesome solicitude about the future.
                 All the goods of life he tasted with epi-
                 
                 
                 curean zest; all the evils he braved with
                 stoical indifference. The mere pleasure 
                 of existence seemed to keep him in
                 perpetual good humour with himself and
                 others; and his never-failing flow of animal
                 spirits exhilerated even the most
                 phlegmatic. To persons of a cold and
                 reserved temper he sometimes appeared
                 rather too much of an egoist; for he talked 
                 with fluent enthusiasm of the excellent
                 qualities and beauties of whatever he loved,
                 whether it were his <ecda:fauna>dog</ecda:fauna>, his <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>, or his
                 <rs type="place">country</rs>: but this was not the egotism of
                 vanity; it was the overflowing of an affectionate
                 heart, confident of obtaining sympathy
                 from his fellow-creatures, because 
                 conscious of feeling it for all that existed.

             <p>He was as grateful as he was generous;
                 and, though high-spirited and impatient
                 of restraint, he would submit 
                 with affectionate gentleness to the voice
                 of a friend, or listen with deference to the
                 counsel of those in whose superior judgment
                 he had confidence. Gratitude, respect,
                 and affection, all conspired to give
                 <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> the strongest power over
                 his soul. <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> had been a guar-
                 
                 
                 dian and a father to him. His own
                 <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="merchant">father</ecda:anonPers>, an opulent merchant, on his death-
                 bed requested that his son, who was then
                 about eighteen, might be immediately sent
                 to <placeName>England</placeName> for the advantages of an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> 
                 education. <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, who
                 had a regard for the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="merchant">father</ecda:anonPers>, arising from
                 circumstances which it is not here necessary
                 to explain, accepted the charge of 
                 young <persName ref="#v">Vincent</persName>, and managed so well,
                 that his ward when he arrived at the age 
                 of twenty-one did not feel relieved from
                 any restraint. On the contrary, his attachment
                 to his guardian increased from 
                 that period, when the laws gave him full
                 command over his fortune and actions.
                 <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> had been at <persName>Harrowgate</persName>
                 for some time before <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> came
                 into the country; but as soon as he heard
                 of <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival's</persName> arrival, he left half
                 finished a game of billiards, of which, by
                 the by, he was extremely fond, to pay his
                 respects at <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>. At the first
                 sight of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, he did not seem much
                 struck with her appearance; perhaps,
                 from his thinking that there was too little
                 langour in her eyes, and too much colour
                 
                 
                 in her cheeks: he confessed that she was
                 graceful, but her motions were not quite
                 slow enough to please him.

              <p>It is somewhat singular that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
                  faithful friend, <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>,

             <p>He had a black servant of the name of
                 <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName>, who was extremely attached to
                 him; he had known <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> from a boy,
                 and had brought him over with him,
                 when he first came to <placeName>England</placeName>, because
                 the poor fellow begged so earnestly to go
                 with young <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>. <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> had lived with
                 him ever since, and accompanied him
                 wherever he went. Whilst he was at 
                 <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> lodged in the
                 same house with <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>. Some dispute
                 arose between their <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servant">servants</ecda:persGroup>, about
                 the right to a coach-house, which each
                 party claimed as exclusively their own.
                 The master of the house was appealed
                 to by <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName>, who sturdily maintained his
                 <distinct type="dialect">massa's</distinct> right; he established it, and rolled
                 his <distinct type="dialect">massa's</distinct> curricle into the coach-
                 house in triumph. <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who
                 heard and saw the whole transaction
                 
                 
                 
                 from her window, said, or swore, that
                 she would make <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> repent of, what
                 she called, his insolence. The threat
                 was loud enough to reach his ears, and
                 he looked up in astonishment to hear
                 such a voice from a woman; but an instant
                 afterwards he began to sing very
                 gayly, as he jumped into the curricle to
                 turn the cushions, and then danced himself
                 up and down by the springs, as if
                 rejoicing in his victory. As second and a
                 third time <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> repeated her threat,
                 confirming it by an oath, and then violently 
                 shut down the window and disappeared.
                 <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, to whom <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName>,
                 with much simplicity, expressed his aversion 
                 of the <quote rend="italic">man-woman</quote> who lived in the
                 house with them, laughed at the odd
                 manner in which the black imitated her
                 voice and gesture, but thought no more
                 of hte matter. Some time afterward,
                 however, <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba's</persName> spirits forsook him, he
                 was never heard to sing or to whistle,
                 he scarcely ever spoke even to his master,
                 who was much surprised by this sudden
                 change from gayety and loquacity to melancholy
                 tacurnity. Nothing could
                 draw from the poor fellow any explana-
                 
                 
                 
                 tion of the cause of this alteration in his
                 humour; and though he seemed excessively
                 grateful for the concern which his
                 master showed about his health, no kindness 
                 or amusement could restore him to
                 his wonted cheerfulness. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>
                 knwe he was passionately fond of
                 music; and having heard him once express
                 a wish for a <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">tambourine</ecda:commodity>, he gave
                 him one: but <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> never played upon it,
                 and his spirits seemed every day to grow
                 worse and worse. This melancholy lasted 
                 during the whole time he remained 
                 at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, but from the first day of
                 his arrival at <placeName>Oakly park</placeName> he began to
                 mend: after he had been there a week,
                 he was heard to sing, and whistle, and
                 talk as he used to do, and his mater
                 congratulated him upon his recovery. 
                 One evening his master asked him to go
                 back to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName> for his <ecda:commodity>tambourine</ecda:commodity>,
                 as little <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles Percival</persName> wished to hear
                 him play upon it. This simple request
                 had a wonderful effect upon poor <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName>;
                 he began to tremble from ehad to foot, his
                 eyes became fixed, and he stood motionless;
                 after some time, he suddenly clasped
                 
                 
                 his hands, fell upon his knees, and exclaimed:
             </p>   
             <p><said><distinct type="dialect">O, massa, <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> die! if <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> go back,

                 that stood upon his forehead. <said><distinct type="dialect">But me
                 will go, if massa bid—me will die</distinct>!</said>                 
             </p>   
           <p><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> began to imagine that the
               poor fellow was out of his senses. He
               assured him with the greatest kindness,
               that he would almost as soon hazard his
               own life, as that of such a faithful affectionate
               servant; but he pressed him to explain 
               what possible danger he dreaded
               from returning to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>. <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> was
               silent, as if afraid to speak—<said>Don't fear
               to speak to me,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> <said>I
               will defend you: if any body have injured
               you, or if you dread that any body
               will ijure you, trust to me, I iwll protect

            <p><said><distinct>Ah, massa, you no can! Me die, if
            me go back! Me no can say word more</distinct>;</said>
            and he put his finger upon his lips, and
            shook his head. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> knew that
            <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> was excessively superstitious; and
            convinced, that, if his mind were not already
            deranged, it would certainly become
            
            
            so, were any secret terror thus to prey
            upon his imagination, he assumed a very 
            grave countenance, and assured him, that
            he should be extremely displeased if he
            persisted in this foolish and obstinate
            silence. Overcome by this, <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> burst
            into tears, and answered.

             </p>   
             <p>This conversation passed before <persName ref="#bp">miss
             Portman</persName> and <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles Percival</persName>, who were
             walking in the park with <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>,
             at the time he met <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName>, and asked him
             to go for the <ecda:commodity>tambourine</ecda:commodity>. When he came
             to the words <quote><said><distinct type="dialect">me will tell all</distinct>,</said></quote> he made
             a sign that he wished to tell it to his
             master alone. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> and the little boy
             walked on then to leave him at liberty to speak;
             and then, though with a sort of reluctant
             horrour, <seg ana="#obeah #poison">he told that the figure of an old
             woman, all in flames, had appeared to
             him in his bed chamber at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>
             every night, and that he was sure she was
             one of the <ecda:anonPers ana="#obeah" a-gender="female" a-occupation="obeah_woman">obeah-woman</ecda:anonPers> of his own
             country, who had pursued him to <placeName>Europe</placeName>
             to revenge his having once, when he was

             contained some of her poisons.</seg>  The extreme

              Vincent</persName> burst out a laughing; but his
              humanity the next instant made him
              serious; for <seg ana="#obeah">the poor victim of superstitious
              terrour after having revealed what,
              according to the belief of his country, it
              is death to mention, fell senseless on the
              ground. When he came to himself, he
              calmly said, that he knew he must now
              die, for that the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" a-occupation="obeah_woman" ana="#obeah">obeah-women</ecda:persGroup> never forgave
              those that talked of them or their
              secrets; and, with a deep groan, he added,
              that he wished he might die before
              night, that he might not see <emph>her</emph>again.
              It was in vain to attempt to reason him
              out of the idea, that he had actually seen
              this apparition: his account of it was,
              that it first appeared to him in the coach-house
              one night, when he went thither in
              the dark—that he never afterward went
              to the coach-house in the dark—btu that
              the same figure of an old woman, all in
              flames, appeared at the foot of his bed
              every night whilst he stayed at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>;
              and that he was then persuaded she
              would never let him escape from her
              power, till she had killed him. That
              since he had left <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, however,
              she had not tormented him, for he had
              
              
              
              never seen her, and he was in hopes
              that she had forgiven him; but that now 
              he was sure of her vengeance for having
              spoken of the past.</seg>

             <p><seg><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> knew the astonishing

             of these witches.</seg> He almost gave poor
             <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> over for lost. The first person that
             he happened to meet after his conversation
             was <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, to whom he eagerly
             related it, because he had observed, that
             she ahd listened with much attention and 
             sympathy to the beginning of the poor
             fellow's story. The moment that she 
             heard of the flaming apparition, she recollected
             having seen a head drawn in 
             phosphorous, which <ecda:anonPers>one of the children</ecda:anonPers> 
             had exhibited for her amusement, and it
             occurred to her that, perhaps, some imprudent 
             or ill-natured person might have
             terrified the ignorant negro by similar 
             means. When she mentioned this to <persName ref="#v">Mr.
             
             
             Vincent</persName> he recollected the threat that
             had been thrown out by <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, the
             day that <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> had taken possession of the
             disputed coach-house; and from the character
             of this lady, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> judged that
             she would be likely to play such a trick,
             and to call it, as usual, fun or frolic. <persName ref="#bp">Miss
             Portman</persName> proposed that a figure should be
             drawn with phosphorous, as nearly as possible 
             to resemble that which <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> had described,
             and that it should be shown to
             him at night, to try whether it would excite
             his apprehensions. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> drew
             the figure of a frightful old woman on the
             wall, opposite to the foot of <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba's</persName> bed.
             In the morning he told his master that he
             had been again visited by the <seg ana="#obeah">obah-
             woman</seg>, and he exhibited all the signs of
             extreme terrour. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> then suggested
             that one of the children should show him
             the phosphorous, and should draw some
             ludicrous figure with it in his presence.
             This was done, and it had the effect that
             she expected. <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> familiarised by degrees
             with the ojbect of his secret horror,
             and convinced that no <seg ana="#obeah">obeah-woman</seg> was
             exercising over him her sorceries, recovered
             his health and spirits. His gratitude
             
             
             to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, who was the immediate
             cause of his cure, was as simple and touching
             as it was lively and sincere. This was 
             the circumstance which first turned <persName ref="#v">Mr. 
             Vincent's</persName> attention upon <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. Upon
             examining the room in which the negro
             used to sleep at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, the strong
             smell of phosphorous was perceived, and 
             part of the paper was burnt on the very
             spot where he had always seen the figure,
             so that he was now perfectly convinced
             that this trick had been purpously played
             to frighten him, in revenge for his having
             kept possession of the coach-house.
             </p>
             <p><persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, when she found herself detected,
             gloried in the jest, and told the story
             as a good joke wherever she went—triumphing
             in the notion, that it was she
             who had drive both <emph>master and man</emph> from
             <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>.
             </p>   
            <p>The exploit was, however, by no means
             agreeable in its consequences to her friend
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, who was now at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>.
             For reasons of her own, she was
             very anxious to fix <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> i nher
             society, and she was much provoked by
             <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke's</persName> conduct. The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">ladies</ecda:persGroup> came
             to high words upon the occasion, and an
             
             
             
             irreparable breach would have ensured, 
             had not <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, in the midst of her
             rage, recollected <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName> electioneering
             interest: and suddenly changing 
             her tone, she declared that <said direct="false">she was
             really sorry to have driven <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> 
             from <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>; that her only intention
             was to get rid of <rs type="person" ref="#juba_0001">his black</rs>; she would lay
             any wanger, that, with <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>
             assistance, they could soon get the gentleman 
             back again;</said>; and she proposed, as
             a certain method of fixing <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>
             in <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs Luttridge's</persName> society, to invite <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
             to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>.
            </p>   
           <p><said>You may be sure,</said> said <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>,
            <said>that she must by this time be cursedly
            tired of her visit to those stupid <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">good
            people</ecda:persGroup> at <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>, and never woman
            <emph>wanted</emph> an excuse to do any thing she
            liked: so trust to her own ingenuity to 
            make some decent apology to the <name>Percivals</name>
            for running away from them. As to <persName ref="#v">Vincent</persName>, you may be sure <persName ref="#bp">Belinda
            Portman</persName> is his only inducement for staying 
            with that precious family party; and
            if we have her, we have him. Now, we 
            can be sure of her, for she has just quarrelled
            with our dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>. I had
            
            
            the whole story from <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid">maid</ecda:anonPers>, who had
            it from <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>. <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> and
            she are at daggersdrawing, and it will be
            delicous to her to hear her ladyship handsomely
            abused. We are the declared 
            enemies of her enemy, so we must be her
            friends. Nothing unites folk so quickly, 
            and so solidly, as hatred of some common
            foe.</said>               
           </p>    
           <p>This argument could not fail to convince
           <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, and the next day
               <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> commenced her operations.
            She drove in her <mcr rend="italic">unicorn</mcr> to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>,
            to pay <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> a visit. She had no
            acquaintance either with <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> or
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, and she had always treated
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, when she met her in town, rather
            cavalierly, as an humble companion of 
            <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>. But it cost <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>
            nothing to change her tone: she was one
            of those ladies, who can remember or 
            forget people, be perfectly familiar, or
            strangely rude, just as it suits the convenience,
            fashion, or humour of the minute.

        <p><said>How do, dear creature?</said> cried she,
          stepping up to her, and shaking hands

          to see you, faith!—Been long here?—Tremendously
          hot to-day!</said>
        </p>        
        <p>She flung herself upon the sofa beside
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, threw her hat upon the table,
         and then continued speaking.
        </p>        
        <p><said>And how d'ye go on here, poor child?
        —God! I'm glad you're alone—Expected
        to find you encompassed by a whole host
        of the righteous. Give me credit for my 
        courange in coming to deliver you out of
        their hands. <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Luttridge</persName> and I had such
        compassion upon you, when we heard
        you were close prisoner here!—I swore

        of all the <ecda:fauna>dragons</ecda:fauna> in <name>Christendom</name>—So let
        me carry you off in triumph in my unicorn,
        and leave these good people to stare
        when theycome home from their sober
        walk, and find you gone. There's nothing
        I like so much as to make good
        people stare—I hope you're of my way
        o'thinking—You don't look as if you were,
        though—but I never mind young ladies'
        looks—always give the lie to their thoughts.
        —Now we talk o'looks—Never saw you
        look so well in my life—as handsome as
        an angel!—And so much the better for
        me.—Do you know, I've a bet of <measure ana="#commodity #currency">twenty
        guineas</measure> on your head—on your face, I

        me to make good my word, and I've 
        pledged myself to produce my beauty at
        the next ball, and to pit her against their
        belle for any money.—Most votes carry
        it.—I'm willing to double my bet since
        I've seen you again.—Come, had not we

       <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who had not been suffered to
           utter a word whilst <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> ran on in
           this strange manner, looked in unfeigned
           astonishment; but when she found herself 
           seized and dragged towards the door,
           she drew back with a degree of gentle 
           firmness that astonished <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>.
           With a smiling countenance, but a steady tone,
           she said, <said direct="false">that she was sorry <persName ref="#hf">Mrs.
           Freke's</persName> knight-errantry should not be
           exerted in a better cause, for that she

       </p>         
       <p><said>And will you make me lose my bet?</said>
       cried <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>. <said>O, at all events, you

       —But I'll not press it now, because you're
       frightened out of your poor little wits, I 
       see, at the bare thoughts of doing any
       thing out of rule by these good people.
       Well, well! it shall be managed for you
       —leave that to me.—I'm used to managing
       for cowards.—Pray tell me—You and
       <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> are off, I understand?—
       Give ye joy!—She and I were once great
       friends; that is to say, I had over
       
       
       her <quote source="galigai_statement">that power which strong minds

       be bad.</said>
       </p>         
       <p><said>The courage to be bad,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
       I believe, indeed, she does not
       possess.
       </p>         
       <p><persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> stared.—<said>Why, I heard
       you had quarrelled with her!</said>           
       </p>         
       <p><said>If I had,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>I hope
       that I should still do justice to her merits.
       It is said that people are apt to suffer
       more by their friends than their enemies.
       I hope that will never be the case with
       <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, as I confess that I have
       been one of her friends.</said>           
       </p>         
       <p><said>'Gad, I like your spirit—you don't 
       want courage, I see, to fight even for your
       enemies. You are just the kind of girl I
       admire—I see you have been prejudiced
       against me by <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>. But whatever
       stories she may have trumped up, the
       truth of the matter is this; there's no living
       with her she's so jealous—so ridiculously
       jealous—of that lord of hers, for
       whom all the time she hasn't the impudence
       to pretend to care more than I do
       
       
       
       for the sole of my boot,</said> said <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>,
       striking it with her whip, <said>but she hasn't
       the courage to give him tit for tat.—Now
       this is what I call weakness. Pray, how
       do she and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> go on together?
       —Are they out o'the hornbook of 
       platonics yet?</said>
       </p>         
       <p><said><persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> was not in town when I

       </p>         
      <p><said>Was not he?—Ho! ho!—He's off
      then!—Ay, so I prophesied. She's not
      the thing for him—He has some strength
      of mind—some soul—above vulgar prejudices
      —So must a woman be to hold
      him. He was caught at first by her
      grace and beauty, and that sort of stuff;
      but I knew it could not last—knew she'd
      dilly dally with <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName>, till he would turn
      upon his heel and leave her there.</said>          
      </p>          
      <p><said>I fancy you are entirely mistaken
      both with respect to <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> and <persName ref="#ld">lady
      Delacour</persName>.</said> <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> very seriously began
      to say; but <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> interrupted her,
      and ran on—
      </p>          
      <p><said>No! no! no! I'm not mistaken;
      <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> has found her out.—She's a <emph>very</emph>
      woman—<emph>that</emph> he could forgive her, and
      so could I—But she's a <emph>mere</emph> woman—
      
      
      and that he can't forgive—no more 
      can I.</said>          
      </p>          
      <p>There was a kind of drollery about
      <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, which, with some people,
      made the odd things she said pass for wit.
      Humour she really possessed; and when
      she chose it, she could be diverting to
      those who like buffonery in women. She 
      had set her heart upon winning <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
      over to her party. She began by flattery
      of her beauty; but as she saw that this
      had no effect, she tried next what could be
      done by insinuating that she had a high
      opinion of her understanding, by talking
      to her as an <foreign xml:lang="fr">esprit fort</foreign>.
      </p>          
      <p><said>For my part,</said> said she, <said>I own I

      </p>          
      <p><said>You forget,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>that it

      <p><said>You read I see!—I did not know
      you were a reading girl.—So did I once!
      but I never read now. Books only spoil
      the originality of genius. Very well for 
      those who can't think for themselves—
      
      
      
      But when one has made up one's opinions,
      there is no use in reading.</said>  
      </p>        
      <p><said>But to <emph>make</emph> them up,</said> replied <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
      <said>may it not be useful?</said>
      </p>        
      <p><said>Of no use upon earth to mids of a

     <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who did not choose to attend

      Freke</persName>, stretching out her hand to <persName ref="#v">Mr.
      Vincent</persName>.
       </p>
       <p>It has been remarked, that an antipathy
       subsists between creatures, who, 
       without being the same, have yet a
       strong external resemblance. <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Per-
       
       
       cival</persName> saw this instinct rising in <persName ref="#v">Mr Vincent</persName>,
       and smiled.
       </p>
       <p><said>Hail, fellow! well met, I say—Shake
       hands and be friends, man!—Though
       I'm not in the habit of making apologies,
       if it will be any satisfaction to you,
       I beg your pardon for frightening your
       poor devil of a <rs type="person" ref="#juba_0001">black</rs>.</said>           
       </p>
       <p>Then turning toward <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, she
        measured him with her eye, as a person
        whom she longed to attack. She thought,
        that if <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> opinion of the understanding
        of <emph>these <name>Pervicals</name></emph> could be lowered,
        she should rise in her opinion: accordingly,
        she determined to draw <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Pervical</persName>
        into an argument.
       </p>         
       <p><said>I've been talking treason, I believe,
       to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,</said> cried she, <said>for I've
       been opposing some of your opinions,
       <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.</said>           
       </p>       
       <p><said>If you opposed them all, madam,</said>
       said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Pervical</persName>, <said>I should not think
       it treason.</said>
       </p>       
       <p><said>Vastly polite!—But I think all our
       politeness hypocrisy. What d'ye say ot
       that?</said>           
       </p>       
      <p><said>You know that best, madam!</said>          
      </p>        
      <p><said>Then I'll go a step farther; for I'm
      
      
      determined you shall contradict me.—
      I think all virtue is hypicrisy.</said>          
      </p>        
      <p><said>It is my system,</said> pursued <persName ref="#hf">Mrs.
      Freke,</persName> <said>that shame is always the cause
      of the vices of women.</said>          
      </p>        
       <p><said>It is sometimes the effect,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr
       Percival</persName>; <said>and, as cause and effect are
       reciprocal, perhaps you ma, in some instances,
       be right.</said>           
       </p>       
      <p><said>O! I hate qualifying arguers—Plump
      assertion or plump denial for me—You
      shan't get off so—I say, shame is the 
      cause of all women's vinces.</said>          
      </p>        
      <p><said>False shame, I suppose you mean?</said>
       said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.
      </p>        
      <p><said>Mere play upon words!—All shame
       is false shame—We should be a great
       deal better without it. What say you,
       <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?—Silent—hey?—Silence
          that speaks.</said>
      </p>        
      <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman's</persName> blushes,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr.
      Vincent</persName>, <said>speak <emph>for</emph> her.</said>          
      </p>        
     <p><said><emph>Against</emph> her,</said>—said <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>—
      <said>Women blush because they understand.</said>   
     </p>         
      
      
      
      
      <p><said>And you would have them understand
      without blushing?</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.
     <said>So would I; for nothing can be
     more different than innocence and ignorance. 
     Female delicacy—</said>     
      </p>
     <p><said>This is just the way you men spoil 
     women,</said> cried <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, <said>by talking
     to them of the <quote rend="italic">delicacy of their sex</quote>, and
     such stuff. This <emph>delicacy</emph> enslaves the
     pretty delicate dears.</said>         
     </p>         
     <p><said>No; it enslaves us,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>.         
     </p>         
     <p><said>I hate slavery! <foreign xml:lang="fr">Vive la liberté</foreign>!</said>
      cried <persName ref="#hf">I'm a champion for
      the Rights of Woman.</persName>   
     </p>         
     <p><said>I am an advocate for their happiness,</said>
     said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, <said>and for their 
     delicacy, as I think it conduces to their
     happiness.</said>   
     </p>         
     <p><said>No, from observation.—Your most
     delicate women are always the greatest
     hypocrites; and, in my opinion, no hypocrite
     can or ought to be happy.</said>         
     </p>         
     <p><said>But you have not proved the hypocrisy,</said>
      said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>Delicacy is not
      
      
      
      I hope, an indisputable proof of it?—If
      you mean <emph>false</emph> delicacy—</said>
     </p>         
     <p><said>To cut the matter short at once,</said>
     cried <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, <said>why, when a woman
     likes a man, does she not go and tell him
     so honestly?</said>
     </p>         
     <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, surprised by this question
     from a woman, was too much abashed 
     instantly to answer.
     </p>         
    <p><said>Because she's a hypocrite. That is
    and must be the answer.</said>        
    </p>          
    <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, <said>because,
    if she be a woman of sense, she knows
    that by such a step she would disgust the
    object of her affection.</said>        
    </p>          
    <p><said>Cunning!—cunning!—cunning!—
    the arms of the weakest.</said>        
    </p>          
     <p><said>Prudence!—prudence! the arms of
     the strongest. Taking the best means
     to secure our own happiness without injuring
     that of others, is the best proof of
     sense and strength of mind, whether in
     man or woman. Fortunately for society,
     the same conduct in ladies which best secures
     their happiness most increases ours.</said>         
     </p>         
     <p><said><persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke beat the devil's tattoo for
     some moments, and then exclaimed—</persName></said>         
     </p>         
     <p><said>You may say what you will, but the
     
     
     
     
     present system of society is radically 
     wrong:—whatever is, is wrong.</said>
     </p>         
     <p><said>How would you improve the state
     of society;</said> asked <persName ref="#hp">Mr Percival</persName> calmly.         
     </p>         
     <p><said>I am not tinker general to the world,</said>
     said she. 
     </p>         
     <p><said>I am glad of it,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>;
      <said>for I have heard that tinkers often spoil
      more than they mend.</said>
     </p>         
     <p><said>But if you want to know,</said> said
      <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, <said>what I would do to improve
      the world, I'll tell you; I'd have
      your sex taught to say, Horns! horns! I 
      defy you.</said>   
     </p>         
      <p><said>This would doubtless be a great improvement,</said>
      said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>; <said>but
      you would not overturn society to attain
      it? would you? Should we find things
      much improved by tearing away what
      has been called the <quote source="#burke_reflections">decent drapery of
      life</quote>?</said>
      </p>        
      <p><said>Drapery, if you ask me my opinion,</said>
      cried <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, <said>drapery, whether
      wet or dry, is the most confoundedly indecent
      thing in the world.</said>  
      </p>        
      <p><said>That depends on <emph>public</emph> opinion, I
      allow,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>. <said>The <rs type="properAdjective">Lacedæmonian</rs>
      ladies, who were veiled only
      
      
      by public opinion, were better covered
      from profane eyes, than some <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
      ladies are in wet drapery.</said>          
      </p>        
      <p><said>I know nothing of the <rs type="properAdjective">Lacedæmonian</rs>
      ladies, I took my leave of them
      when I was a schoolboy—girl—I should 
      say. But, pray, what o'clock is it by
      you—I've sat till I'm cramped all over,</said>
      cried <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, getting up and stretching
      herself so violently that some part of 
      her habiliments gave way. <said xml:lang="fr">Honi sont
      qui mal y pense!</said> said she, bursting into
      a horse laugh.
      </p>        
      <p>Without sharing in any degree that 
      confusion which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> felt for her,
      she strode out of the room, saying, <persName ref="#bp">Miss
      Portman</persName>, you understand these things
      better than I do; come and set me to
     rights. 
      </p>        
       <p>When she was in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> room, she
        threw herself into an arm chair, and
        laughed immoderately.
       </p>     
       <p><said>How I have trimmed <persName ref="#hp">Percival</persName> this
       morning,</said> said she.
       </p>
       <p><said>I am glad you think so,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>;
       <said>for I really was afraid he had
       been too severe upon you.</said>
       </p>       
       <p><said>I only wish,</said> continued <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>,
           
           
       <said>I ony wish <rs type="person" ref="#ap">his wife</rs> had been by.
       Why the devil did she not make her appearance?—I  suppose the prude was
       afraid of my demolishing and unrigging
       her.</said>           
       </p>       
       <p><said>There seems to have been more
       danger of that for you than for any body
       else,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, as she assisted to
       said <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke's</persName> <emph>rigging</emph>, as she called it,
       to rights.
       </p>       
        <p><said>I do of all things, delight in hauling
        good people's opinions out of their
        musty drawers, and seeing how they look
        when they're all pulled to pieces before
        their faces. Pray, are those <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne's</persName>
        drawers or yours?</said> said <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>,
        pointing to a ghest of drawers.    
        </p>      
        <p><said>Mine.</said>            
        </p>      
        <p><said>I'm sorry for it; for, if they were hers
        to be punished for <emph>shirking</emph> me, by the
        Lord, I'd have every rag she has in the
        world out in the middle of the floor in
        ten minutes! You don't know me—I'm a
        terrible person when provoked—Stop at 
        nothing!</said>            
        </p>     
        <p>As <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> saw no other chance
         left of gaining her point with <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
         she tried what intimidating her would do.   
        </p>     
             
             
             
         <p><said>I stop at nothing,</said> repeated she,
          fixing her eys upon <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, to
          fascinate her by terrour. <said>Friend or foe!
          Peace or war! Take your choice.—
          Come to the ball at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, I win
          my bet, and I'm your sworn friend.—
          Stay away, I lose my bet, and am your
          sworn enemy.</said>
         </p>    
         <p><said>It is not in my power, madam,</said> said
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> calmly, <said>to comply with your
         request.</said>
         </p>    
         <p><said>Then you'll take the consequences,</said>
          cried <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>. She rushed past her,
          hurried down stairs, and called out,
         </p>    
         <p><said>Bid my blockhead bring my unicorn.</said>             
         </p> 
         <p>She, her unicorn, and her <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="groom">blockhead</ecda:anonPers>,
          were out of sight in a few minutes.
         </p>   
          <p>Good may be drawn from evil. <persName ref="#hf">Mrs
          Freke's</persName> conversation, though at the time
          it confounded <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, roused her, upon
          reflection, to examine by her reason the 
          habits and principles which guided her 
          conduct. She had a general feeling that
          they were right and necessary; but now,
          with the assistance of <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> and
          <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, she established in her own
          understanding the exact boundaries be-
          
          
          
          
          tween right and wrong upon many subjects.
          She felt a species of satisfaction and security,
          from seeing the demonstration of
          those axioms of morality, in which she had
          previously acquiesced. Reasoning gradually
          became as agreeable to her as wit;
          nor was her taste for wit diminished, it
          was only refined by this process. She
          now compared and judged of the value of
          the different species of this brilliant talent.
          </p>
          <p><persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke's</persName> wit, thought she, is like
          a noisy squib—the momentary terrour of 
          passengers—<persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>, like an elegant
          fire work, which we crowd to see, and
          cannot forbear to applaud—but <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne
          Percival's</persName> wit is like the refulgent moon, 
          we,

          </p>
          <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Percival</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>,
          <said>are you not afraid of making an enemy
          of <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, by declining her invitation
          to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>?</said>
         </p>   
         <p><said>I think her friendship more to be
         dreaded than her enmity,</said> replied <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>             
         </p>    
         <p><said>Then you are not to be terrified by
         an <seg ana="#obeah">obeah-woman</seg>?</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>.</p>   
             
             
             
         <p><said>Not in the least, unless she were to
         come in the shape of a false friends,</said> said
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.    
         </p>    
         <p><said>Till lately,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, <said>I
         was deceived in the character of <persName ref="#hf">Mrs.
         Freke</persName>. I thought her a dashing, free-
         spoken, free-heared sort of eccentric
         person, who would make a stanch
         friend, and a jolly companion. As a
         mistress, or a wife, no man of any taste
         could think of her. Compare that woman
         now with one of our creole ladies.</said>             
         </p>    
         <p><said>But why with a creole?</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr.
         Percival</persName>.             
         </p>    
          <p><said>For the sake of contrast in the first
          place—Our creole women are all softness,
          grace, delicacy—</said>              
          </p>   
          <p><said>And indolence,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.          
          </p>   
          <p><said>Their indolence is but a slight, and,
          in my judgment, an amiable defect; it
          keeps them out of mischief, ad it attaches
          them to domestic life. The activity
          of a <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> would never excite
          their emulation, and so much the better.</said>              
          </p>   
         <p><said>So much the better, no doubt,</said>
          said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>. <said>But is there no
          other species of activity, that might excite
          their ambition with propriety? With-
          
          
          
          
          out diminishing their grace, softness, or
          delicacy; might not they cultivate their
          minds? Do you think ignorance, as well
          as indolence, an amiable defect essential
          to the female character.</said>
         </p>    
          <p><said>Not essential. You do not, I hope,
          imagine that I am so much prejudiced in
          favour of my countrywomen, that I can
          neither see nor feel the superiority in
          <emph>some instances</emph> of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> cultivation?
          I speak only in general.</said>              
          </p>   
           <p><said>And in general,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne
           Percival</persName>, <said>does <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, wish to
           confine our sex to the bliss of ignorance?</said>

            <p><said>If it be bliss,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>,
            <said>what reason would they have for complaint?</said>    
            </p> 
            <p><said><emph>If</emph>,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>but that is a
            question which you have not yet decided.</said>                
            </p> 
             <p><said>And how can we decide it;</said> said
              <persName ref="#v">Mr Vincent</persName>. <said>The tastes and feelings
              of individuals must be the arbiters of
              their happiness.</said>   
             </p>
             <p><said>You leave reason quite out of the
             question, then,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, <said>and
             refer the whole to taste and feeling?
             So that, if the most ignorant person
             
             
             
             
             in the world assert that he is happier 
             than you are, you are bound to believe 
             him.</said>                 
             </p>
             <p><said>Why should not I?</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr Vincent</persName>.                 
             </p>
             <p><said>Because,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, <said>though
             he can judge of his own pleasures, he cannot
             judge of your; his are common to
             both, but yours are unknown to him.—
             Would you, at this instant, change places
             with that ploughman yonder, who is
             whistling as he goes for want of thought?
             or, would you choose to go a step higher
             in the bliss of ignorance, and turn savage?</said>                 
             </p>
             <p><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> laughed, and protested
                 that he should be very unwilling to give
                 up his title to civilized society; and that,
                 instead of wishing to have less knowledge,
                 he regretted that he had not more.                 
             </p>
            <p><said>I am sensible,</said> said he, <said>that I have
            many prejudices:—<persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> has
            made me ashamed of some of them.</said>                
            </p>
            <p>There was a degree of candour in <persName ref="#v">Mr
            Vincent's</persName> manner and conversation, which
            interested every body in his favour; <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
            amongst the rest. She was perfectly
            at ease in <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> company, because
            she considered him as a person who
            
            
            wished for her friendship, without having
            any desire to engage her affections. From
            several hints that dropped from him, from
            <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, and from <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, she
             was persuaded that he was attached to
             some <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-aig="creole">creole lady</ecda:anonPers>; and all that he said in
             favour of the elegant softness and delicacy
            of his countrywomen confirmed this opinion.
            </p> 
            <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> was not one of those
             young ladies, who fancy that every gentleman
             who converses freely with them will
             inevitably fall a victim to the power of
             their charms, and who see in every man a
             lover, or nothing.

         <p>His mother took him by the hand, as
         he was going to repeat the question, and
         leading him out of the room, desired him
         
         
         
         to show her the place where he found the

         <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, to <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> greatrelief,
         seemed not to take any notice of the
         child's question, nor to have any sympathy
         in his curiosity; she was intently
         copying <persName ref="#richard_westall_1765">Westal's</persName> sketch of <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne
         Percival</persName> and her <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">family</ecda:persGroup>; and she had
         been roused, by the first mention of <persName ref="#hd">Helena
         Delacour's</persName> name, to many painful
         and some pleasing recolections.—<said>What
         a charming woman; and what a charming
         family!</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> as he looked at
         the drawing, <said>and how much more interesting
         is this picture of domestic happiness,
         than all the pictures of shepherds
         and sheperdesses, and gods and goddesses,
         that were ever draw!</said>             
         </p>       
         <p><said>There cannot,</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vin-

         picture! O, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>! is it
         possible that you should not feel what you
         can paint so well?</said>             
         </p>       
         <p><said>Is it possible, sir,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
          <said>that you should suspect me of such
          wretched hypocrisy, as to effect to admire
          what I am incapable of feeling?</said>
         </p>       
         <p><said>You misunderstand—you totally
         misunderstand me—Hypocrisy!—No;
         there is not a woman upon earth whom 
         I believe to be so far above all hypocrisy,
         al affectation.—But I imagined—
         I feared—</said>             
         </p>       
          <p>As he spoke these words he was
              in some confusion, and hastily turned over
              the prints in a portfolio which lay upon
              the table. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> eye was caught by
              an engraving of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> in the character
              of the comic muse. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>
              did not know the intimacy that had subsisted
              between her ladyship and <persName ref="#bp">miss
              Portman</persName>—She sighed from the recollection
              of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and all of that
              had passed at the masquerade.
          </p>      
         <p><said>What a contrast!</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>,
          placing the print of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>  beside
          the picture of <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>. <said>What 
          
          
          a contrast!—Compare their pictures:—
          compare their characters:—compare—</said>
         </p>       
         <p><said>Excuse me,</said> interrupted <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>;
         <said><persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was once my friend, and
         I do not like to make a comparison so
         much to her disadvantage. I have never
         seen any woman who would not suffer
         by a comparison with <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>.</said>    
         </p>       
          <p><said>I have been more fortunate, I <emph>have</emph>
          seen one—one equally worthy of esteem
          —admiration—love.</said>              
          </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> voice faltered in pronouncing
          the word <mentioned>love</mentioned>; yet <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
          prepossessed by the idea that he was attached
          to some creole lady, simply answered,
          without looking up from her
          drawing, <said>You are indeed very fortunate,
          peculiarly fortunate. Are the <rs type="properAdjective">West-Indian</rs>
          ladies—</said>
          </p>      
           <p><said><rs type="properAdjective">West-Indian</rs> ladies!</said> interrupted <persName ref="#v">Mr. 
           Vincent</persName>. <said>Surely, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> cannot
           imagine that I am at this istant thinking
           of any <rs type="properAdjective">West-Indian</rs> lady!</said> <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
           looked up with an air of surprise.—
           <said>Charming <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>!</said> continued
            he, <said>I have learnt to admire <emph><rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> 
            beauty</emph>, <emph><rs type="properAdjective">European</rs></emph> excellence.—I have ac-
            
            
            
            quired new ideas of the female character—
            ideas—feelings that must henceforward
            render me exquisitely happy, or exquisitely
            miserable.</said>
           </p>     
            <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> had been too often called
             <said><quote rend="itaic">charming</quote></said>, to be much startled or delighted 
             by the sound: the word would
             have passed by unnoticed, but there was
             somethng so impassioned in <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> 
             manner, that she could no longer
             mistake it for common gallantry, and she 
             was in evident confusion.—Now for the
             first time the idea of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> as a
             lover came into her mind. The next
             instant she accused herslef of vanity, and
             dreaded that he should read her thoughts.
             <said><quote>Exquisitely miserable</quote>!</said> said she in a
             tone of raillery. <said>I should not suppose,
             from what I have seen of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>,
             that any thing could make him exquisitely
             miserable.</said>          
            </p>
            <p><said>Then you do not know my character
            —you do not know my heart.—It is in
            <emph>your</emph> power to make me exquisitely miserable.
            —Mine is not the cold hackneyed
            phrase of gallantry, but the fervid language
            of passion,</said> cried he, seizing her
            hand.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>At this instant <ecda:anonPers>one of the children</ecda:anonPers>
            came in with some flowers for <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>;
            and glad of the interruption, she hastily
            put up her drawings and left the room,
            obseving that she should scarcely have time to dress before dinner.—However,
            as soon as she found herself alone, she
            forgot how lte it was; and though she
            sat down before the glass to dress, she
            made no progress in the business, but
            continued for some time motionless, endeavouring
            to recollect and to understand
            all that had passed. The result of
            her reflections was the conviction, that
            her partiality for <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was
            greater, than she had till this moment
            suspected.—<said>I have told my <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>,</said>
            thought she, <said>that the idea of <persName ref="#ch">Mr
            Hervey</persName> had no influence in my refusal of
            <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>. Then why do I feel this alarm at
            the discovery of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> views?
            Why do I compare him with one whom
            I thought I had forgotten?—And yet,
            how are we to judge of character?—How
            can we form any estimate of what is
            amiable, of what will make us happy or
            
            
            miserable, but by comparison?—Am I to
            blame to perceiving superiority?—Am I
            to blame if one person be more agreeable,
            or seem to be more agreeable than another?
            —Am I to blame if I cannot love
            <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Before <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had answered these
                questions to her satisfaction, the dinner-
                bell rang. There happened to dine this
                day at <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival's</persName> a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">gentleman</ecda:anonPers> who
                had just arrived from <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>, and the
                conversation turned upon the sailors'
                practice of stilling the waves over the
                bar of <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> by throwing oil upon the
                water. <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles Percival's</persName> curiosity was
                excited by this conversation, and he
                wished to see the experiment. In the
                evening his father indulged his wishes. 
                The <ecda:persGroup>children</ecda:persGroup> were delighted at the sight, 
                and little <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName> insisted upon <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
                following him to a particular spot, where
                he was well convinced that she could see
                better than any where else in the world.
                <said>Take care,</said> cried <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>or you
                will lead your friend into the river,
                <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>.</said> The boy paused, and soon
                afterward asked his father several questions
                about swimming and drowning, and 
                
                
                bringing people to life after they had 
                been drowned. <said>Don't you remember,
                papa,</said> said he, <said><emph>that</emph> <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, who was
                almost drowned in the <placeName>Serpentine river</placeName> in
                <placeName>London</placeName>?</said>—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> coloured at hearing
                unexpectedly the name of the person of
                whom she was at that instant thinking,
                and the child continued—             
            </p>
            <p><said>I liked that <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> very much
            —I liked him from the first day I saw
            him. What a number of entertaining
            things he told us at dinner! We used to
            call him the good natured gentelman.—I
            like him very much—I wish he was
            here this minute. Did you ever see him,
            <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?—O yes, you must have 
            seen him; for it was he who carried <persName ref="#hd">Helena's</persName>
            <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna> to her mother, and he 
            used often to be at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>—was
            not he?</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>Yes, my dear, often.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>And did you not like him very much?</said>
            —This simple question threw <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
             into inexpressible confusion: but fortunately
             the crimson on her face was seen
             only by <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>. To <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
             great satisfaction, <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> forbore
                
                
                
                
              this evening any attempt to renew the
              conversation of the morning: he endeavoured
              to mix, with his usual animation
              and gayety, in the family society; and
              her embarrassment was much lessened,
              when she heard the next day at breakfast,
              that he was gone to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>. 
              <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne Percival</persName> too notice that she
                was this morning unusually sprightly.
            </p>
            <p>After breakfast, as they were passing
            though the hall to take a walk in the park,
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">one of the little boys</ecda:anonPers> stopped to look at a
                musical instrument which hung up against 
                the wall.
            </p>
            <p><said>What is this, mamma?—It is not a
            guitar, is it?</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>No, my dear, it is called a <distinct>banjore</distinct>;
            it is an <rs>African</rs> instrument, of which the
            negroes are particularly fond—<persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>
            mentioned it the other day to <persName ref="#bp">miss
            Portman</persName>, and I believe she expressed
            some curiosity to see one. <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> went
            to work immediately to make a banjore,
            I find.—Poor fellow, I dare say that he
            was very sorry to go to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, and
            to leave his <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> guitar half finished;
            especially as it was intended for an of-
            
            
            fering to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. He is the most 
            grateful affectionate creature I ever saw.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>But why, mamma,</said> said <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles
            Percival</persName>, <said>is <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> gone away? I
            am sorry he is gone, I hope he will soon
            come back.—In the mean time I must run
            and water my <ecda:flora>carnations</ecda:flora>.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>His sorrow for his friend <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName>
            departure does not seem to afect 
            his spirits much,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>.
            <said>People who expect sentiment from
            children of six years old will be disappointed,
            and will probably teach them
            affectation. Surely it is much better to
            let their natural affections have time to
            expand. If we tear the <ecda:flora>rosebud</ecda:flora> open, we
            spoil the flower.</said> <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> smiled at this
            parable of the <ecda:flora>rosebud</ecda:flora>, which, she said,
             might be applied to men and women, as
            well as to children.  
            </p>
            <p><said>And yet, upon reflection</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady
            Anne</persName>, <said>the heart has nothing in common
            with a <ecda:flora>rosebud</ecda:flora>. Nonsensical allusions
            pass off very prettily in conversation.
            —I mean, when we converse with partial
            friends: but we should reason ill, and
            conduct ourselves worse, if we were to
            
            
            
            trust implicitly to poetical analogies.
            Our affections,</said> continued <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>,
            <said>arise from circumstances totally independent
            of our will.</said>                
            </p>    
            <p><said>That is the very thing I meant to 
            say,</said> interrupted <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> eagerly.                
            </p>    
            <p><said>They are excited by the agreeable or
            useful qualities that we discover in things
            or in persons.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>Undoubtedly,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.                
            </p>
            <p><said>Or by those which our fancies discover,</said> 
             said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>.                
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was silent; but after a pause
             she said, <said>That it was certainly very dangerous,
             especially for women, to trust to 
             fancy in bestowning their affections. And 
             yet,</said> continued she, <said>it is a danger to
             which they are much exposed in society.
             Men have it in their power to assume the
             appearance of every thing that is amiable
             and estimable, and women have scarcely
             any opportunities of detecting the counterfeit.
             Without <quote source="#milton_paradise"><persName ref="#ithuriel_0001">Ithuriel's</persName> spear</quote>, how can
             they distinguish the good from the evil?</said>
              said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>This is a commonplace
              complaint, I know; the ready excuse that
              we silly young women plead, when we
              
              
              
              
              make mistakes for which our friends reproach
              us, and for which we too often reproach 
              ourselves.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>The complaint is commonplace precisely
            because it is general and just,</said> replied
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <said>In the slight and
            frivolous intercourse, which fashionable
            belles usually have with those fashionable
            beaux who call themselves thier lovers, it
            is surprising that they can discover any
            thing of each other's real character. Indeed
            they seldom do; and this probably
            is the cause why there are so many unsuitable
            and unhappy marriages. A woman
            who has an opportunity of seeing
            her lover in private society, in domestic 
            life, has infinite advantages; for if she has 
            any sense, and he has any sincerity, the
            real character of both may herhaps be developed.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>True,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> (who now suspected
            that <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> alluded to <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>;)
            <said>and in such a situation a woman
            would readily be able to decide, whether
            the man who addressed her would suit her
            taste or not; so she would be inexcusable
            if, either from vanity or coquetry, she disguised
            her real sentiments.</said>                 
            </p>
            
            
            <p><said>And will <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, who cannot,
            by any one to whom she is known, be
            suspected of vanity or coquetry, permit
            me to speak to her with the freedom of
            a friend?</said>                
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, touched by the kindness of
             <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne's</persName> manner, pressed her hand,
              and exclaimed, <said>Yes, dear <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, 
              speak to me with freedom, you cannot do
              me a greater favour. No thought of my
              mind, no secret feeling of my heart, shall
              be concealed from you.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>DO not imagine that I wish to encroach upon the generous openness of your
            temper,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>; <said>tell me when
            I go too far, and I will be silent. One
            who, like <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, has lived in the
            world, has seen a variety of characters,
            and probably has had a variety of admirers,
            must have formed some determinate
            idea of the sort of companion,
            that would make her happy, if she were
            to marry—unless,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>she
            has formed a resolution against marriage.</said>               
            </p>
            <p><said>I have formed no such resolution,</said>
            said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>Indeed, since I have seen
            the happiness which you and <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>
            enjoy in your own family, I have been,
            
            
            
            much more disposed to think that a union
            —that a union such as yours, would increase
            my happiness. At the same time,
            my aversion to the idea of marrying from
            interest, or convenience, or from any motives
            but esteem and love, is increased
            almost to horror. O, <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>! there 
            is nothing that I would not do to please
            the friends to whom I am under obligations,
            except sacrificing my peace of mind,
            or my integrity, the happiness of my life,
            by—</said>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName>, in a gentle tone, assured
            her, that she was the last person in the
            world, who would press her to any union
            which would make her unhappy. <said>You
            perceive that <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> has spoken to
            me of what passed between you yesterday.
            You perceive that I am his friend, but do
            not forget that I am also yours. If you
            fear <emph>undue influence</emph> from any of <ecda:persGroup>your relations</ecda:persGroup>
            in favour of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> large
            fortune, &amp;c. let his proposal remain a
            secret between ourselves, till you can decide,
            from further acquaintance with her,
            whether it will be in your power to return
            his affection.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>I fear, my dear <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>,</said> cried
                
             
             <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>that it is not in my power to
             return his affection.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>And may I ask your objections?</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>Is it not a sufficient objection, that I
            am persuaded I cannot love him.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>No; for you may be mistaken in that
            persuasion. Remember what we said a
            little while ago, about <quote rend="italic">fancy and spontaneous
            affections</quote>. Does <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> appear
            to you defective in any of the qualities,
            which you think essential to happiness?
            <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> has known him from
            the time he was a man, and can answer
            for his integrity and his good temper.
            Are these not the first points you would
            consider? They ought to be, I am sure,
            and I believe they are. Of his understanding
            I shall say nothing, because you
            have had full opportunities of judging of
            it from his conversation.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> appears to have a good
            understanding,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.                
            </p>
            <p><said>Then to what do you object?—Is
            there any thing disgusting to you in his
            person or manners?</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>He is very handsome, he is well bred,
            and his manners are unaffected,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
             <said>but—do not accuse me of caprice
             
             
             
             —altogether he does not suit my taste;
             and I cannot think it sufficient not to feel
             disgust for a husband—though I believe
             this is the fashionable doctrine.</said>    
            </p>
            <p><said>It is not mine, I assure you,</said> said
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <said>I am not one of those who
            think it <quote source="#sheridan_rivals">safest to begin with a little aversion</quote>;
            but since you acknowledge, that
            <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> possesses the essential good
            qualities that entitle him to your esteem,
            I am satisfied. We gradually acquire
            knowledge of the good qualities of those
            who endeavour to please us; and if they
            are really amiable, their persons become
            agreeable to us by degrees, when we became
            accustomed to them.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>Accustomed!</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, smiling,
            <said>one does grow accustomed even to disagreeable
            things certainly: but at this
            rate, my dear <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, I do not doubt
            but one might grow <emph>accustomed</emph> to <persName ref="#caliban_0001">Caliban</persName>.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>My belief in the reconciling power
            of custom does not quite go so far,</said> said
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <said>It does not extend to <persName ref="#caliban_0001">Caliban</persName>,
            or even to the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">hero</ecda:anonPers> of <title ref="#beauty_beast">La Belle et la
            Bête</title>; but I do believe, that, in a mind so
            well regulated as yours, esteem may cer-
            
            
            tainly in time be improved into love. I 
            will tell <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> so, my dear.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>No, my dear <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>! No; you
            must not, indeed you must not. You
            have too good an opinion of me—my mind
            is not so well regulated—I am much
            wealer, much sillier, than you imagine—
            than you can conceive,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.                
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName> soothed her with the most
             affectionate expressions, and concluded
             with saying: <said><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> has promised
             not to return from <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, to torment
             you with his addresses, if you be
             absolutely determined against him. He
             is of too generous, and perhaps too proud
             a temper, to persecute you with vain solicitations;
             and however <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> and
             I may wish that he could obtain such
             a wife, we shall have the common, or
             uncommon, sense and good nature to
             allow our friends to be happy their own
             way.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>You are very good; too god. But
            am I then to be the cause of banishing
            <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> from all his friends—from
            <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>?</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>Will he not do what is most prudent,
            to avoid the charming <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,</said>
            
            
            
            
            said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> smiling, <said>if he must not
            love her? This was at least the advice I
            gave him, when he consulted us yesterday
            evening. But I will not sign his write of
            banishment lightly. Nothing but the assurance
            that the heart is engaged, can be
            a sufficient cause for despair; nothing else
            could, in my eyes, justify you, my dear
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, from the charge of caprice.</said>
            </p>
            <p><said>I can give you no such assurance, I
            hope—I believe,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> in great
            confusion; <said>and yet I would not for the
            world deceive you; you have a right to
            my sincerity.</said> She paused; and <persName ref="#ap">lady
            Anne</persName> said with a smile, <said>Perhaps I can
            spare ou the trouble of telling me in
            words what a blush told me, or at least
            made me suspect, yesterday evening, when
            we were standing by the river-side, when
            little <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName> asked you—</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>Yes, I remember—I saw you look at 
            me.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>Undesignedly, believe me.</said></p>
            <p><said>Undesignedly, I am sure; but I was
            afraid you would think—</said>                
            </p>
            <p><said>The truth.</said></p>
            <p><said>No; but more than the truth. The
            truth you shall hear; and the rest I will
            
            
            leave to your judgment and to your kindness.</said>                
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> gave a full acocount of her
             acquaintance with <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>; of
             the variations in his manner towards
             her; of his excellent conduct with respect
             to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> (of this, by the by,
             she spoke at large). But she was more 
             concise when she touched upon the state 
             of her own heart; and her voice almost
             failed when she came to the history of the
             lock of beautiful hair, the <placeName>Windsor</placeName> incognita,
             and the picture of <persName ref="#vs">Virginia</persName>. She
             concluded by expressing her conviction of
             the propriety of forgetting a man, who
             was in all probability attached to another,
             and she declared it to be her resolution, to
             banish him from her thoughts. <persName ref="#ap">Lady
             Anne</persName> said <said>that nothing could be more
             prudent, or praiseworthy, than forming
             such a resolution—except keeping it.</said>—
             <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName> had a high opinion of <persName ref="#ch">Mr.
             Hervey</persName>; but she had no doubt, from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
             account, and from her own observations
             on <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, and from slight
             circumstances which had accidentally come
             to <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival's</persName> knowledge, that he was
             as <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> suspected, attached to <persName ref="#vs">Virginia
             
             
             
             St. Pierre</persName>. She wished, therefore, to confirm
             <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> in this belief, and to
              turn her thoughts towards one who, beside
              being deserving of her esteem and
              love, felt for her the most sincere affection.
              She did not, however, press the subject
              farther at this time, but contented herself
              with requesting, that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> would take
              three days (the usual time given for deliberation
              in fairy tales) before she would
              decided against <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>.
            </p>    
            <p>The next day they went to look at a 
             porter's lodge, which <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> had
             just built; it was inhabited by an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old
             man</ecda:anonPers> and <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">woman</ecda:anonPers>, who had for many 
             years been industrious tenants, but who,
             in their old age, had been reduced to
             poverty, not by imprudence, but by misfortune.
             <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName> was please d to see
             them comfortably settled in their new
             habitation; and whilst she and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
             were talking to the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">old couple</ecda:persGroup>, their
             grand-daughter, a pretty-looking girl of
             about eighteen, came in with a basket of 
             <ecda:food>eggs</ecda:food> in her hand. <said>Well, <persName ref="#lucy_0001">Lucy</persName>,</said> said
             <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>have you overcome your
             dislike to <persName ref="#james_jackson_0001">James Jackson</persName>?</said> The girl
             reddened, smiled, and looked at her
             
             
             <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">grandmother</ecda:anonPers>, who answered for her in
             arch tone, <said>O, yes, my lady! We
             are not afraid of <persName ref="#james_jackson_0001">Jackson</persName> <emph>now</emph>; we are
             grown very great friends. This pretty
             <ecda:commodity>cane chair</ecda:commodity> for my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">good man</ecda:anonPers> was his
             handiwork, and these <ecda:commodity>baskets</ecda:commodity> he made
             for me. Indeed, he's a most industrious,
             ingenious, good natured youth;
             and our <persName ref="#lucy_0001">Lucy</persName> takes no offence at his
             courtiner her now, my lady, I can assure
             you. That <ecda:commodity>necklace</ecda:commodity>,</said> added she in a
             half-whisper, pointing to a <ecda:commodity>necklace of
             <ecda:flora><rs type="properAdjective">Angola</rs> pease</ecda:flora></ecda:commodity> which the girl wore—<said>that
             <ecda:commodity>necklace</ecda:commodity> is a present of his, which is
             never off her neck now, my lady. So I 
             tell him he need not be discouraged,
             though so be she did not take to him at
             the first; for she's a good girl, and a
             sensible girl, I say it, though she's my
             own: and the eyes are used to a face 
             after a time, and then it's nothing. They
             say, <name>Fancy's</name> all in the love. Now in
             my judgment, fancy's little or nothing
             with girls that have sense. But I beg pardon
             for prating at this rate, more especially
             when I am so old as to have forgot
             all the little I ever knew about such
             things.</said>
            </p>    
            
            
            <p><said>But you have the best right in the
            world to speak about such things, and
            your <rs ref="#lucy_0001" type="person">grand-daughter</rs> has the best reason
            in the world to listen to you,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady
            Anne</persName>, <said>because, in spite of all the
            crosses of fortune, you have been an excellent and happy wife, at least ever since I
            can remember.</said>                
            </p>
             <p><said>And ever since I can remember, that's
             more; no offence to your ladyship,</said> said
             the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers>, striking his crutch against
             the ground. <said>Ever since I can remember,
             she has made me the happiest man
             in the world, in the whole parish,
             as every body knows, and I best of all!</said>
             cried he, with a degree of enthusiasm, that
             lighted up his aged countenance, and animated
             his feeble voice.
             </p>   
             <p><said>And yet,</said> said the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">honest dame</ecda:anonPers>, <said>if
             I had followed my fancy, and taken up
             with my first love, it would not ha' been
             with <emph>he</emph>, <persName ref="#lucy_0001">Lucy</persName>. I had a sort of a fancy
             (since my lady's so good as to let me 
             speak), I had a sort of fancy for an idle
             young man; but he, very luckily for me,
             took it into his head to fall in love with
             another young woman, and then I had leisure
             enough left me to think of your grand-
             
             
             
             father, who was not so much to my taste
             like at first. But when I found out his 
             goodness and cleverness, and, joined to
             all, his great tenderness for me, I thought
             better of it, <persName ref="#lucy_0001">Lucy</persName> (as who knows but you
             may do, though there shall not be a word
             said on my part to press you, for poor
             <persName ref="#james_jackson_0001">Jackson</persName>?) and my thinking better is the
             cause why I have been so happy ever
             since, and am so still in my old age. Ah,
             <persName ref="#luch_0001">Lucy</persName>, dear! what a many years that same
             old age lasts, after all! But young folks,
             for the most part, never think what's to
             come after thirty or forty at furthest. But
             I don't say this for you, <persName ref="#luch_0001">Lucy</persName>; for you
             are a good girl, and a sensible girl,
             though my own grand-daughter, as I said
             before, and therefore won't be run away
             with by fancy, which is soon past and
             gone—but make a prudent choice, that
             you won't never have cause to repent of.
             But I'll say a word more; I'll leave it
             all to yourself and <persName ref="#james_jackson_0001">James Jackson</persName>.</said>                 
             </p>   
             <p><said>You do right,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>;
             <said>Good morning to you! Farewel, <persName ref="#lucy_0001">Lucy</persName>!
             That's a pretty necklace; and is very becoming
             to you—fare ye well!</said>
             </p>   
             <p>She hurried out of the cottage with
                 
                 
             <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, apprehensive that the talkative
              <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old dame</ecda:anonPers> might weaken the effect of her
              good sense and experience by a further
              profusion of words.                 
             </p>   
             <p><said>One would think,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> with
             an ingenuous smile, <said>that this lesson
             upon the dangers of <emph>fancy</emph> was intended
             for me: at any rate, I may turn it to my
             own advantage!</said>                 
             </p>   
             <p><said>Happy those who can turn all the
             experience of others to their own advantage!</said>
             said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <said>This would
             be a more valuable privilege, than the
             power of turning every thing that is
             touched to gold.</said>
             </p>   
             <p>They walked on in silence for a few
               minutes; and then <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> , pursuing
               the train of her own thoughts, and
               unconscious that she had not explained
               them to <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, abruptly exclaimed,
               <said>But if I should be entangled, so as
               not to be able to retract!—and if it should
               not be in my power to love him at last,
               he will think me a coquette, a jilt perhaps;
               he will have reason to complain of me, if 
               I waste his time, and trifle with his affections.
               Then it is not better that I should
               avoid, by a decided reusal, all possibility
               
               
               of injury to <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, and of blame to
               myself?</said>
             </p>
             <p><said>There is no danger of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName>
             misunderstanding or misrepresenting you.
             The risk that he runs is by his voluntary
             choice; and I am sure that, if after further
             acquaintance with him you find it
             impossible to return his affection, he will
             not consider himself as ill-used by your
             refusal.</said>                 
             </p>   
             <p><said>But after a certain time—after the
             world suspects that two people are engaged
             to each other, it is scarcely possible
             for the woman to recede: when they 
             come within a certain distance, they are
             pressed to unite, by the irresistible force
             of external circumstances. A woman
             is too often reduced to this dilemma—
             Either she must marry a man she does not
             love, or she must be blamed by the world
             —either she must sacrifice a portion of
             her reputation, or the whole of her happiness.</said>
            </p>   
            <p><said>The world is indeed often too curious,
            and too rash in these affairs,</said> said
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <said>A young woman is not
            in this respect allowed sufficient time
            for freedome of deliberation. She sees,
            
            
            as <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> once said, <quote><said>the drawn
            sword of tyrant custom suspended over
            her head by a single hair</said></quote>.</said>
            </p>    
            <p><said>And yet, notwhithstanding you are
            so well aware of the danger, your ladyship
            would expose me to it,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.                
            </p>    
            <p><said>Yes. For I think the chance of
            happiness, in this instance, overbalances
            the risk,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <said>As we
            cannot alter the common law of custom,
            and as we cannot render the world less
            gossiping, or less censorious, we must not
            expect always to avoid censure; all we
            can do is, never to deserve it—and it would
            be absured to enslave ourselves to the 
            opinion of the idle and ignorant. To a
            certain point, respect for the opinion of the
            world is prudence! beyond that point, it
            is weakness. You should also consider
            that the <emph>world</emph> at <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> and in <placeName>London</placeName>
            are two different worlds. In <placeName>London</placeName>
            if you and <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> were seen often in
            each other's company, it would be immediately
            buzzed about, that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> 
            and <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> were going to be
            married; and if the match did not take
            place a thousand foolish stories might be
            told to account for it's being broken off.
            
            
            
            But here you are not surrounded by busy
            eyes and busy tongues. The butchers,
            bakers, ploughmen, and spinsters, who
            compose our world, have all the affairs of 
            their own to mind. Besides, their comments
            can have no very extensive circulation;
            they are used to see <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>
            continually here; and his staying
            with us the ermainder of the autumn will
            not appear to them any thing wonderful,
            or portentous.</said>
            </p>    
            <p>Their conversation was interrupted.
             <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> returned to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>—
             but upon the express condition, that he
             should not make his attachment public
             by any particular attentions, and that
             he should draw no conclusions in his
             favour from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> consenting to converse
             with him freely upon every common
             subject. To this treaty of amity <placeName ref="#ap">lady
             Anne Percival</placeName> was guarantee.

            never agree in their definition of the word

            complaints on the one hand of a breach
            of treaty, and, on the other, solemn protestations
            of the most scrupulous adherence
            to his compact. However this
            might be, it is certain that the gentleman
            gained so much by either truth or fiction,
            that, in the course of some weeks, he

          <p>One evening, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was playing
           with little <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles Percival</persName> at jack-

           and <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, who took an interest in
           every thing which entertained his children,
           were looking on at this simple game.
          </p>      
                
                
           <p><said><persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>condescending

           <p><said>Yes,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>; <said>for he is of

            <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>, who was anxious that she should
             win, though he was playing against her.
             <said>Take care! don't touch that knave!</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>I would lay a <measure ana="#currency #commodity">hundred guineas</measure> upon

           </p>     
           <p><said>Softly! softly, <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>!—No betting,

           </p>     
           <p><said>It was my fault—it was I who was

           <p><said>I am sure you are in the right now,</said>
            
            
            
            said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>; <said>and, what is better
            than my saying so, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> thinks
            so, as her smile tells me.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>You moved, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>!</said> cried
            <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles</persName>, <said>O, indeed! the king's head

            knew it was impossible that you could
            get that knave clear off without shaking
            the king. Now, papa, only look how
            they were balanced.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>I grant you,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, <said>I
           should have made an imprudent bet.
           So it is well I made none; for now I see
           the chances were ten to one, twenty to
           one, a hundred to one against me.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>It does not appear to me to be a
           matter of chance,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.
           <said>This is a game of address, not chance,
           and that is the reason I like it.</said>    
           </p>     
           <p><said>O papa! O <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>! look
           how nicely these are balanced. There!
           my breath has set them in motion.—
           Look, they shake, shake, shake, like
           the great rocking stones at <placeName>Birmham
           Craggs</placeName>.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>That is comparing small things to
           great, indeed!</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.               
           </p>     
           <p><said>By the by,</said> cried <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>,
               
           
           
           <said><persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> has never seen these wonderful
           rocking stones—Suppose we were
           to ride to see them to-morrow?</said>               
           </p>     
           <p>The proposal was warmly seconded by
             the <ecda:persGroup>children</ecda:persGroup>, and agreed to by every one.
             It was settled, that after they had seen
             <placeName>Birmham Craggs</placeName> they should spend the
               remainder of the day at <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">lord ―'s</ecda:anonPers>, a beautiful
              place in the neighbourhood.
           </p>     
           <p>The next morning was neither too hot
              nor too cold, and they set out on their
              little party of pleasure: the <ecda:persGroup>children</ecda:persGroup>
               went with their mother, to their great
               delight, in the <emph>sociable</emph>; and <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>,
               to his great delight, rode with <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.
               When they came within the sight of the
               <placeName>Craggs</placeName>, <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, who was riding
               with them, exclaimed—<said>What is that
               yonder on the top of one of the great
               rocking stones?</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>It looks like a statue,</said> said <persName ref="#v">Vincent</persName>.
             <said>It has been put up since we were here
             last.</said>  
           </p>     
            <p><said>I fancy it has got up of itself,</said> said
              <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>for it seems to be getting 
              down of itself. I think I saw it stoop.
              —O! I see now, it is a man who has
              got up there, and he seems to have a gun
              
              
              
              in his head, has not he? He is going 
              through his manual exercise for his diversion
              —For the diversion of the spectators
              below, I perceive—There is a party of
              people looking at him.</said>
            </p>    
            <p><said>Him!</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.                
            </p>    
            <p><said>I protest it is a woman!</said> said <persName ref="#v">Vincent</persName>.               
            </p>    
            <p><said>No, surely,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>: <said>It cannot
            be a woman!</said>                
            </p>    
           <p><said>Not unless it be <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>,</said> replied
             <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.  
           </p>     
           <p>In fact, it was <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who had
             been out shooting with a party of <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>,
             and who had scrambled upon this
             rocking stone, on the summit of which
             she went through the manual exercise at
             the word of command from her <ecda:anonPers>officer</ecda:anonPers>. As 
             they rode nearer to the scene of action,
             <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> heard the shrill screams of a
              female voice, and they descried amongst
              the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> a slight figure in a riding
              habit.
           </p>     
           <p><said><persName ref="#moreton_0001">Miss Moreton</persName>, I suppose?</said> said <persName ref="#v">Mr.

           </p>
           <p><said>Poor girl! what are they doing with
           her?</said> cried <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>They seem to be
           
           
           
           forcing her up to the top of the place,
           where she has no mind to go.—Look
           how <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> drags her up by the
           arm!</said>               
           </p>     
           <p>As they drew nearer, they heard <persName ref="#hf">Mrs.
           Freke</persName> laughing loud as she rocked this
           <rs ref="#moreton_0001" type="person">frightened girl</rs> upon the top of the
           stone.
           </p>     
           <p><said>We had better keep out of the way,
           I think,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; <said>for perhaps, as
           she has vowed vengeance against me, she
           might take a fancy to setting me upon that
           pinnacle of glory.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>She dare not,</said> cried <persName ref="#v">Vincent</persName>, his eyes
            flashing with anger: <said>you may trust to 
            us to defend you.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>Certainly!—But I will not run into 
           danger on purpose to give you the pleasure
           of defending me,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; and
           as she spoke, she turned her <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> another
           way.
           </p>     
           <p><said>You won't turn back, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?</said>
            cried <persName ref="#v">Vincent</persName> eagerly, laying his
            hand on her bridle.—<said>Good God,
            ma'am! we can't run away!—We came
            here to look at these rocking stones!—
            We have not half seen them. <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName>
            
            
            and the <ecda:persGroup>children</ecda:persGroup> will be here immediately.
            You would not deprive them of the pleasure
            of seeing these things!</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>I doubt whether they would have
           much pleasure in seeing <emph>some of these
           things!</emph> and, as to the rest, if I disappoint
           the children now, <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>
           will, perhaps, have the goodness to bring
           them some other day.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>Certainly,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>: <said><persName ref="#bp">miss
           Portman</persName> shows her usual prudence.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>The <ecda:persGroup>children</ecda:persGroup> are so good tempered,
           that I am sure they will forgive me,</said> continued
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; <said>and <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> will
           be ashamed not to follow their example,
           though he seems to be rather angry with
           me at present for obliging him to turn
           back—out of the path of danger.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>You must not be surprised at that,</said>
           said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, laughing; <said>for <persName ref="#v">Mr.
           Vincent</persName> is a lover and a hero. You
           know it is a ruled case, in all romances,
           that, when a lover and his mistress go out
           riding together, some adventures must befal 
           them. The <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> must run away with
           the lady, and the gentleman must catch
           her in his arms just as her neck is about to
           be broken. If the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> has been too ill
           
           
           
           trained for the heroine's purpose, <quote rend="quotes">some
           footpad, bandit fierce, or mountaineer,</quote> 
           some jealous rival must make his appearance
           quite unexpectedly at the turn of a
           road, and the lady must be carried off,
           robes flying! hair streaming like <persName ref="gottfried_burger_1747">Buerger's</persName>
           <persName ref="#leonora_0001">Leonora</persName>. Then her lover must come to
           her rescue just in the proper moment.—
           But if the damsel cannot conveniently be
           run away with, she must, at the last resource,
           tumble into a river to make herself
           interesting, and the hero must be at least
           half drowned in dragging her out, that she
           may be under eternal obligations to him,
           and at last be forced to marry him out of
           pure gratitude.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>Gratitude!</said> interrupted <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>:
           <said>He is no hero to my mind, who
           would be content with gratitude, instead
           of love.</said>

           <p><said>You need not alarm yourself: <persName ref="#bp">miss

           smiling. <said>Now it is really to be regretted,

           from the perilous height of one of those

           do not know her history. <persName ref="#moreton_0001">Miss Moreton</persName> 
           ran away from her <ecda:persGroup>friends</ecda:persGroup> to live with this
           <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who has led her into all kinds
           of mischief and absurdity. The girl is
           weak and vain, and believes that every 
           thing becomes her, which <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> assures
           her is becoming. At one time she
           was persuaded to go to a public ball with
           her arms as bare as <persName ref="#juno_0001">Juno's</persName>, and her feet as
           naked as <persName ref="#theresa_tallien_1773">madame Tallien's</persName>. At another
           time <persName ref="#moreton_0001">miss Moreton</persName> (who unfortunately
           had never heard the <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> prover, that
           <quote>half is better than the whole</quote>) was persuaded
           by <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> to lay aside her
           half boots, and to equip herself in men's
           whole boots; and thus she rode about the
           country, to the amazement of all the world.
           
           
           
           —These are trifles; but women who love
           to set the world at defiance in trifles, seldom
           respect it's opinion in matters of
           consequence. <persName ref="#moreton_0001">Miss Moreton's</persName> whole boots
           in the morning, and her bare feet in the
           evening, were talked of by every body,
           till she gave them more to talk of about
           her attachment to a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="soldier">young officer</ecda:anonPers>. <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. 
           Freke</persName>, whose philosophy is professedly
           latitudinarian in morals, laughed at the
           girl's prejudice in favour of the ceremony
           of marriage. So did the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="soldier" a-gender="male">officer</ecda:anonPers>; for <persName ref="#moreton_0001">miss
           Moreton</persName> had no fortune. It is suspected,
           that the young lady did not feel the dfficulty,
           which philosophers are sometimes
           said to find in suiting their practice to
           their theory. The <emph>unenlightened</emph> world
           reprobated the theory much, and the practice
           more. I am inclined, in spite of scandal,
           to think the poor girl was only imprudent:
           at all events, she repents her
           folly too late. She has now no friend upon
           earth but <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who is, in fact, her
           worst enemy, and who tyrranizes over her
           without mercy. Imagine what it is to be
           the butt of a buffoon!</said>

           <said>But had <persName ref="#moreton_0001">miss Moreton</persName> no relations,
           who could interfere to get her out of
           <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke's</persName> hands!</said>               
           </p>     
           <said><p>Her father and mother were old, and,
           what is more contemptible, old-fashioned:
           she would not listen to their advice,
           she ran away from them. Some of her
           relations were, I believe, willing that she
           should stay with <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, because
           she was a <choice><sic>dashnig</sic><corr>dashing</corr></choice> fashionable woman,
           and they thought it might be what is
           called <distinct rend="italic">an advantage</distinct> to her. She had one
           relation, indeed, who was quite of a different
           opinion, who saw the danger of
           her situation, and remonstrated in the
           strongest manner—but to no purpose.
           This was a cousin of <persName ref="#moreton_0001">miss Moreton's</persName>, a
           respectable clergyman. <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> was
           so much incensed by his <emph rend="italic">insolent interference</emph>,
           as she was pleased to call it, that
           she made an effigy of <persName ref="#moreton_0002">Mr. Moreton</persName>
           dressed in his canonicals, and hung the
           figure up as a scarecrow in a garden close
           by the high road. He was so much beloved
           and respected for his benevolence
           and unaffected piety, that <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> totally
           failed in her design of making him
           ridiculous; her scarecrow was torn to
           
           
           
           pieces by his <ecda:persGroup>parishoners</ecda:persGroup>; and though, in
           the true spirit of charity, he did all he
           could to moderate their indignation against
           his enemy, the lady became such an object 
           of detestation, that she was followed
           with hisses and groans whenever she appeared,
           and she dared not venture within
           <measure>ten miles</measure> of the <rs type="person">village</rs>.</p>
           <p><persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> now changed the mode
           of her persecution: she was acquainted
           with a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">nobleman</ecda:anonPers> from whom our clergyman
           expected a living, and she worked
           upon <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">his lordship</ecda:anonPers> so successfully, that he
           insisted upon having an apology made to
           the lady. <persName ref="#moreton_0002">Mr. Moreton</persName> had as much
           dignity of mind as gentleness of character;
           his forbearance was that of principle,
           and so was his formness: he refused to
           make the concessions that were required.
           His <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">noble patron</ecda:anonPers> bullied. Though he
           had a large <ecda:persGroup>family</ecda:persGroup> to provide fore, the clergyman
           would not degrade himself by any
           improper submission. The incumbent died,
           and the living was given to a more compliant
           friend.—So ends the history of one
           of <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke's</persName> numerous frolics.

           looked upon her as one of those thoughtless,

            they must end in malice. They defy the 
            world—the world in return excommunicates
            them—the female outlaws become
            desperate, and make it the business and
            pride of their lives to disturb the peace of
            their sober neighbours. Women who
            have lowered themselves in the public opinion

            praise <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> without blushing,
            and she could think even of his generosity
            without enthusiasm, though not without
            pleasure. By strength of mind, and timely
            exertion, she had prevented her prepossession
            from going into a passion that
            might have made her miserable. Proud of
            this conquest over herself, she was now
            disposed to treat <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> with more
                
                
            favour than usual. Self-complacency generally
            puts us in god humour with our

            <p>After spending some pleasant hours in

            </p>    
           <p><said>Yes, but my taste has quite changed.</said></p>     
           <p><said>I remember the time,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>,
           <said>when you thought it impossible
           that your taste should ever change; when
           you told me that taste, whether for the
           beauties of animate or inanimate nature,
           was immutable.</said>
           </p>
           <p><said>You and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> have taught
           me better sense. First loves are generally
           silly things,</said> added he, colouring a little
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> coloured also.
           </p>     
                
                
           <p><said>First loves,</said> continued <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>,
            <said>are not necessarily more foolish than
            others; but the chances are certainly
            against them. Proximity of time or place,
            a variety of accidental circumstances more
            than the essential merits of the object,
            often produce what is called first love.
            From poetry or romance, young people
            usually form their early ideas of love, before
            they have actually felt the passion;
            and the image which they have in their
            own minds of the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">beau ideal</foreign> is cast upon
            the first objects they afterward behold.
            This, if I may be allowed the expression,
            is <name><persName ref="#cupid_0001">Cupid's</persName> Fata Morgana</name>. Deluded mortals
            are in ecstasy whilst the illusion lasts,
            and in despair when it vanishes.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> appeared to be unconscious,
            that what he was saying was any way applicable
            to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. He addressed himself
            to <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> solely, and she listened
            at her ease.
           </p>     
           <p><said>But,</said> said she, <said>do not you think that
           this prejudice, as I am willing to allow it
           to be, in favour of first loves, may <emph>in our
           sex</emph> be advantageous? Even when a woman
           may be convinced that she ought not to
           indulge a <emph>first</emph> love, should she not pe pre-
           
           
           
           
           vented by delicacy from thinking of a second?</said>               
           </p>
           <p><said>Delicacy, my dear <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, is
           a charming word, and a still more charming
           thing, and <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> has probably 
           increased our affection for it; but even
           delicacy, like all other virtues, must be
           judged by the test of utility. We should 
           run into romance, and errour, and misery,
           if we did not constantly refer to this 
           standard. Our reasonings as to the conduct
           of life, as far as moral prudence is
           concerned, must depend ultimately upon
           facts. Now, of the numbers of people in
           this world, how many do you think have
           married their <emph>first loves</emph>? Probably not
           one out of ten.—Then, would you have
           nine out of ten pine all their lives in celibacy,
           or fret in matrimony, because they
           cannot have the persons who first struck
           their <emph>fancy</emph>?</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>I acknowledge this would not add
           to the happiness of society,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.               
           </p>     
           <p><said>Nor to it's virtue,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>.
            <said>I scarcely know an idea more
            dangerous to domestic happiness, than
            this belief in the unextinguishable nature
            
            
            of a first flame. There are people who
            would persuade us, that, though it may be
            smothered for years, it must break out at 
            ast, and blaze with destructive fury.—
            Pernicious doctrine! false as it is pernicious!
            —The struggles between duty
            and passion may be the charm of romance,
            but msut be the misery of real
            life. The woman who marries one man,
            and loves another, who, in spite of all
            that an amiable and estimable husband
            can do to win her confidence and affection,
            nourishes in secret a <emph>fatal</emph> prepossession
            for her first love, may perhaps, by
            the eloquence of a fine writer, be made
            an interesting heroine;—but would any
            man of sense or feeling choose to be troubled
            with such a wife?—Would not even
            the idea that women admired such conduct
            necessarily tend to diminish our
            confidence, if not in their virtue, at
            least in their sincerity? And would not
            this suspicion destroy our happiness?
            Husbands may sometimes have delicate
            feelings as well as their wives, though
            they are seldom allowed to have any by
            these unjust novel writers.—Now could a
            husband who has any delicacy be content
            
            
            to possess the person without the mind?
            —the duty without the love?—Could he
            be perfectly happy, if, in the fondest
            moments, he might doubt whether he
            were an object of disgust or affection?—
            whether the smiles of apparent joy were
            only the efforts of a suffering martyr?—
            Thank Heaven! I am not married to
            one of these charming martyrs. Let
            those live with them who admire them.
            For my part, I admire and love the
            wife, who not only seems but is happy
            —as I,</said> added <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> smiling,
            <said>have the fond credulity to believe. If I
            have spoken too long or too warmly upon
            the chapter of <emph>first loves</emph>, I have at least
            been a perfectly disinterested declaimer;
            for I can assure you, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, that
            I do not suspect <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName> of
            sighing in secret for some vision of perfection,
            any more than she suspects me
            of pining for the charming <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
            who, perhaps, you may have heard was my
            <emph>first love</emph>. In these days, however, so few
            people marry with even the pretence to
            love of any sort, that you will think I
            might have spared this tirade.—No; there
            are ingenuous minds which will never be
            
            
            
            enslaved by fashion or interest, though
            they may be exposed to be deceived by
            romance, or by the <emph>delicacy</emph> of their own
            imaginations.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><said>I hear,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> smiling, <said>I hear
           and understand the emphasis with which
           you pronoucne that word <mentioned rend="italic">delicacy</mentioned>. I see
           you have not forgotten, that I used it improperly
           half an hour ago, as you have
           convinced me.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p><said>Happy they,</said> said <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>,
           <said>who can be convinced in half an hour!
           There are some people who cannot be convinced
           ina whole life, and who end
           where they began, with saying—<said>This
           is my opinion—I always thought so, and
           always shall.</said></said>               
           </p>     
           <p><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> at all times loved <persName ref="#hp">Mr.
           Perciva</persName>; but he never felt so much affection
           for him as he did this evening,
           and his arguments appeared to him unanswerable.
           —Though <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had never
           mentioned to <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> the name of
           <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> till this day; and though
           he did not in the least suspect from her
           manner, that this gentleman ever possessed
           any interest in her heart; yet with
           her accustomed sincerity she had confess-
           
           
           ed to him, that an impression had been
           made upon her mind before she came to
           <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>.               
           </p>     
           <p>After this conversation with <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>,
           <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> perceived that he
            gained ground more rapidly in her favour;
            she became accustomed to consider
            him as a lover, and his company
            grew every day more agreeable to her
            taste: he was convinced that, as he possessed
            her esteem, he should in time secure
            her affections. 
           </p>     
           <p><said>In time,</said> repeated <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Perciva</persName>:
             <said>you must allow her time, or you
             will spoil all.</said>
           </p>     
           <p>It was with some difficulty that <persName ref="#v">Mr.
           Vincent</persName> restrained his impatience, even
           though he was persuaded of the prudence
           of his friend's advice. Things
           went on in this happy, but as he thought
           slow, state of progression till towrds the
           latter end of Septemner.               
           </p>
           <p>One fine morning <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>
            came into <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> room with a bridal
            favour in her hand—<said>Do you know,</said>
            said she, <said>that we are to have a wedding
            to-dau. This favour has just been sent to
            my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid">maid</ecda:anonPers>. <persName ref="#lucy_0001">Lucy</persName>, the pretty girl whom
            
            
            
            you may remember to have seen some 
            time ago in a <ecda:commodity>necklace</ecda:commodity> of <ecda:flora><rs type="properAdjective">Angola</rs> pease</ecda:flora>,
            is the bride, and <persName ref="#james_jackson_0001">farmer Jackson</persName> is the
            bridegroom. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> has let them
            a very pretty little farm in the neighbourhood,
            and—hark! there's the sound of
            music.</said>
           </p>   
           <p>They looked out of the window, and
           they saw a troop of villagers gayly dressed,
           going to the wedding. <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName>, who
           was always eager to promote innocent
           festivity, sent immediately to have a tent
           pitched in the park: and all the rural company
           were invited to a dance in the evening:
           it was a very cheerful spectacle.—
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> heard from all sides praises of 
           <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> generosity; and she could
           not be insensible to the simple but enthusiastic
           testimony which <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> bore to
           his master's goodness. <seg ana="#performance"><persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> had composed
           in his broken dialect, a little song
           in honour of his master, which he sang to
           his banjore with the most touching expression
           of joyful gratitude. In some
           of the stanzas, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> could distinguish
           that her own name was frequently repeated.
           <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName> called him, and desired
           to have the words of this song. They
           
           
           were a mixture of <name>English</name> and of his native
           language; they described in the strongest 
           manner what had been his feelings, whilst
           he was under the terrour of <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke's</persName>
           fiery <seg ana="#obeah">obeah woman</seg>, then his joy on being
           relieved from these horrours, with
           the delightful sensations of returning
           health;—and thence he suddenly passed
           to his gratitude to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, the person to
           whom he owed his recovery. He concluded 
           with wishing her all sorts of happiness,
           and, above all, that she might be
           fortunate in her love; which <persName ref="#juba_0001">Juba</persName> thought
           the highest degree of felicity. He had
           no sooner finished his song, which particularly
           touched and pleased <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
           than he begged his master to offer to her
           the little instrument, which he had made
           with much pains and ingenuity.</seg> She accepted
           the banjore with a smile that enchanted
           <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>; but at this instant
           they were startled by the sound of a carriage
           driving rapidly into the park. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> 
           looked up, and between the heads
           of the <ecda:persGroup>dancers</ecda:persGroup> she had just caught a glimpse of
           a well-known livery.—<said>Good heavens!</said>
           she exclaimed, <said><persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> carriage!
           —Can it be <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>?</said>
           </p>
                
                
           <p>The carriage stopped, and <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> 
            hastily jumped out of it. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> pressed
            forward to meet her; poor <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> was
            in great agitation:—<said>Oh, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman!</persName>!
            my <rs ref="#ld" type="person">poor lady</rs> is very ill—very ill indeed.
            She has sent me for you—here's her 
            letter. Dear <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, I hope you
            won't refuse to come?—She <emph>has</emph> been
            very ill, and <emph>is</emph> very ill; but she would
            be better, if she could see you again.
            But I'll tell every thing, ma'am, when we
            are by ourselves, and when you have read
            your letter.</said>
           </p>     
           <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> immediately accompanied
            <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> towards her house; and as
            they walked thither, she learned that
            <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had applied to the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="doctor" a-gender="male">quack</ecda:anonPers>
            in who she had such implicit faith, and
            had in vain endeavoured to engage him
            to perform for her the operation, to which
            she had determined to submit. He was            
            afraid to hazard it, and he prevailed upon
            her to give up the scheme, and to try
            some external remedy from which
            he promised wonders. No one knew 
            what his medicines were, but they affected
            her head in the most alarming manner.               
           </p>     
           <p>In her delerium she called frequently
               
           
           upon <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, sometimes accusing
           her of the basest treacher, sometimes
           addressing her as if she were present,
           and pouring forth the armest expressions.
           of friendship. <said>In her lucid intervals,
           ma'am,</said> continued <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, 
          <said xml:id="s019" next="s020">she for some weeks scarcely ever mentioned
          your name, nor could bear to hear
          me mention it. One day, when I was 
          saying how much I wished that you
          were with her again, she darted at me
          the most terrible look that I ever beheld.</said>               
           </p>
          <p><said prev="#s019" xml:id="s020"><said>When I am in my grave, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said>
          cried <rs type="person" ref="#ld">my lady</rs>, <said>it will be time enough
          for <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> again to visit this house,
          and you may then express your attachment
          to her with more propriety than at
          present.</said> These were my lady's own
          words—I shall never forget them—They
          struck and astonished me, ma'am, so much
          I stood like one stupified, and then left
          the room to think them over again by myself,
          and make sense of them if I could.—
          Well, ma'am to be sure, it then struck me
          like a flash of lightning, that my lady
          was jealous—and, begging your pardon
          ma'am, of you. This seemed to me the
          most unnatural thing in the world, consi-
          
          
          
          
          dering how easy my lady had always </said>
          seemed to be about <rs type="person" ref="#md">my lord</rs>; but it was
          now clear to me, that this was the cause
          of your leaving us so suddenly, ma'am.—
          Well, I was confident that <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr. Champfort</persName>
          was at the bottom of the business from
          the first; and now that I knew what
          scent to go upon, I went to work with
          fresh spirit to find him out; which was a
          thing I was determined upon, and what
          I'm determined upon I generally do,
          ma'am. So I put together things about
          <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> and my lord, that had
          dropped at odd times from <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="servant"><persName ref="#bp">Sir Philip Baddely's</persName>
          gentleman</ecda:anonPers>; and I, partly serious
          and partly flirting, which in a good cause
          is no sin, drew from him (for he pretends
          to be a little an admirer of mine, ma'am,
          though I never gave him the smallest encouragement)
          all he knew or suspected,
          or had heard reported, or whispered:—
          and out it came, ma'am, that <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr. Champfort</persName>
          was the original of all; and that he
          had told a heap of lies about some banknotes
          that my lord had given you, and
          that you and my lord were to be married
          as soon as my lady was dead; and I don't
          know what, which he maliciously circu-
          
          
          
          lated through <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant" a-gender="male"><persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName> gentleman</ecda:anonPers> to <persName ref="#pb">sir
          Philip</persName> himself, and so round again to my 
          lady. Now, <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant" a-gender="male"><persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName> man</ecda:anonPers> behaved like
          a gentleman upon the occasion, which I
          shall ever be free to acknowledge and remember:
          and when I represented things
          properly, and made him sensible of the
          mischief which he assured me was done,
          purely with ane eye to serve <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName> his
          master, he very candidly offered to assist
          me to unmask that villain <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>,
          which he could easily do with the assitance
          of a few bottles of <ecda:food>claret</ecda:food>, and a few
          fair words; which, though I can't abide
          hypocrisy, I thought quite allowable upon
          such an occasion. So, ma'am, when <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr.
          Champfort</persName> was thrown off his guard by
          the <ecda:food>claret</ecda:food>, <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant" a-gender="male"><persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName> gentleman</ecda:anonPers> began
          to talk of my lord and my lady, and
          <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>; and he observed that my
          lord and my lady were coming together
          more than they used to be since <persName ref="#bp">miss
          Portman</persName> left the house. To which
          <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> replied with an oath, like an
          unmannered reprobate as he is, and in
          his gibberish, <name>French</name> and <name>English</name>, which
          I can't speak; but the sense of it was
          this:—<said>My lord and my lady shall never
          
          
          come together if I can help it. It was to
          hinder this that I got <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> banished;
          for my lord was quite another man after
          she god <persName ref="#hd">miss Helena</persName> into the house; and
          I don't doubt but he might have been
          brought to leave off his <ecda:food>burgundy</ecda:food>, and
          set up for a sober regular man; which
          would not suit me at all. If my lady once
          was to get power over him again, I might
          go whistle—so (with another reprobate
          oath) my lord and my lady shall never
          come together again whilst I live.</said>              
          </p>      
          <p><said xml:id="s021" prev="#s020">Well, ma'am,</said> continued <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,
          <said xml:id="s022" next="#s023">as soon as I was in possession of this 
          precious speech, I carried it and a letter
          of <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant" a-gender="male"><persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName> gentleman</ecda:anonPers> vouching
          it, to my lady. My lady was thunderstruck,
          and so vexed, to have been, 
          as she said, a dupe, that she sent for <rs type="person" ref="#md">my
          lord</rs> directly, and insisted upon his giving
          up <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr. Champfort</persName>.—My lord demurred,
          because my lady spoke so high,
          and said <mentioned rend="italic">insist</mentioned>. He would have done it,
          I'm satisfied, of his own accord, with the
          greatest pleasure, if my lady had not as
          it were commanded it. But he answered
          at last, <said>My <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, I'm not
          a man to be governed by a wife—I shall
          
          
          keep or part with my own servants, in
          my own house, according to my own
          pleasure;</said> and saying so he left the room.
          I never saw my lady so angry as she was
          at this refusal of my lord to part with
          him. The house was quite in a state of
          distraction for some days. I never would
          sit down to the same table, ma'am, with
          <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr. Champfort</persName>, nor speak to him, nor
          look at him, and parties ran high above
          and below stairs.—And at last my lady,
          who had been getting better, took to her
          bed again with a nervous fever, which
          brought her almost to death's door; she
          having been so much weakened before
          by the quack medicines, and convulsions,
          and all her sufferings in secret. She
          would not see my lord on no account, and 
          <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> persuaded him her illness was
          pretence, to bring him to her purpose; 
          which was the more readily believed, because
          nobody was ever let into my lady's
          bedchamber but myself. All this time
          she never mentioned your name, ma'am; 
          but once, when I was sitting by her bed
          side, as she was asleep, she started suddenly,
          and cried out,—<said>O my dearest
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! are you come back to me?</said>—
          
          
          She awakened herself with the start; and
          raising herself quite up in her bed, she
          pulled back the curtains, and looked all 
          round the room. I'm sure she expected
          to see you; and when she found it was a
          dream, she gave a heavy sigh and sunk
          down upon her pillow. I then could not
          forbear to speak, and this time my lady
          was greatly touched when I mentioned
          your name:—she shed tears, ma'am, and
          you know it is not a little thing that can
          draw tears from my lady. But when I
          said something about sending for you, she
          answered, she was sure you would not return
          to her, and that she would never condescend
          to ask a favour in vain even from
          you. Then I replied that I was sure you
          loved her still, and as well as ever; and
          that the proof of that was, that <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>
          and <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> together, by all
          their wiles, could not draw you over to
          their party at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>, and that you
          had affronted <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> by defending
          her ladyship. My lady was all surprise
          at this, and eagerly asked how I came to
          know it.—Now, ma'am, I had it all by a
          post letter from <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName> maid</ecda:anonPers>,
          who is my cousin, and knows every thing
          
          
          that's going on. My lady from this moment 
          forward could scarce rest an instant
          without wishing for you, and fretting
          for you, as I knew by her manner. One
          day my lord met me on the stairs as I was
          coming down from my poor lady's room,
          and he asked me how she was, and why
          she did not send for a physician. <said>The 
          best physician, my lord, she could send
          for,</said> said I, <said>would be <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>; 
          for she'll never be will till that good
          young lady comes back again, in my
          humble opinion.</said></said>              
          </p>      
          <p><said prev="#s022" xml:id="s023" next="#s023"><said>And what should prevent that good
          young lady from coming back again? Not
          I, surely?</said> rejoined <rs type="person" ref="#md">my lord</rs>, <said>for I wish
          she were here with all my heart.</said></said>              
          </p>      
          <p><said xml:id="s024" prev="#s023"><said>It is not easy to suppose, <rs type="person" ref="#md">my lord</rs>,</said>
          said I, <said>after all that has passed, that the
          young lady would choose to return, or
          that my lady would ask her, whilst <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr.
          Champfort</persName> remains paramount in the
          house.</said>—<said>If that's all,</said> cried my lord,
          <said>tell your lady I'll part with <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>
          upon the spot; for the rascal has just had
          the insolence to insist upon it, that a
          pair of new boots are not too tight for
          me, when I said they were. I'll show
          
          
          
          him I can be master, and will, in my own
          house.</said>—Ma'am, my heart leaped for
          joy within me at hearing these words,
          and I ran up to <rs type="person" ref="#ld">my lady</rs> with them. I 
          easily concluded in my own mind, that
          my lord was glad of the pretence of the
          boots, to give up handsomely after his 
          standing out so long. To be sure, my
          lord's mightily jealous of being master,
          and mightily fond of his own way; but I
          forgive him every thing for doing as I
          would have him at last, and dismissing
          that prince of mischief-makers <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Mr.
          Champfort</persName>. My lady called for her
          writing-desk directly, and sat up in her
          bed, and with her trembling hand, as you
          see by the writing, ma'am, wrote a letter
          to you as fast as ever she could, and the
          postchaise was ordered. I don't know
          what fancy siezed her—but,—if you remember,
          ma'am, the hammercloth to her new
          carriage had orange and black fringe at first.
          She would not use it, till this had been
          changed to blue and white. Well, ma'am,
          she recollected this on a sudden, as I was
          getting ready to come for you; and she
          set the <ecda:persGroup>servants</ecda:persGroup> at work directly to take
          off the blue and white, and put on the
          
          
          
          black and orange fringe again, which
          she said must be done before your coming.
          And my lady ordered her own <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="footman" a-gender="male">footman</ecda:anonPers>
          to ride along with me; and I have
          come post, and ahve travelled night and
          day, and will never rest till I get back.
          But, ma'am, I won't keep you any longer
          from reading your letter, only to say
          that I hope to Heaven you will not refuse
          to return to my poor lady, if it be only to
          put her mind at ease before she dies.—
          She cannot have long to live.</said>
          </p>      
         <p>As <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> finished these words they
          reached the house, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> went to
          her own room to read <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> 
          letter. It contained none of her customary
          <quote rend="quotes"><foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">éloquence du billet</foreign></quote>, no sprightly
          wit, no real, no affected gayety; her mind
          seemed to be exhausted by bodily suffering,
          and her high spirit subdued. She expressed the most poignant anguish for
          having indulged such junust suspicions
          and intemperate passions. She lamented
          having forfeited the esteem and affection
          of the only real friend she had ever possessed
          —a friend of whose forbearance,
          tenderness, and fidelity, she has received
          such indisputable proofs. She concluded
          
          
          
          by saying, <quote rend="quotes">I feel my end fast approaching,
          and perhaps, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, your humanity
          will induce you to grant my last request,
          and to let you see me once more
          before I die.</quote>             
         </p>       
         <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> immediately decided to return
          to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—though it was with
          real regret that she thought of leaving
          <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName>, and the amiable and
          happy <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">family</ecda:persGroup> to whom she ahd become
          so much attached. The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">children</ecda:persGroup> crowded 
          round her when they heard that she was 
          going, and <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> stood in silent
          sorrow—but we spare our readers this parting
          scene. <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> promised to 
          return to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> as soon as she possibly
          could. <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> anxiously requested
          permission to follow her to town:
          but this she positively refued; and he 
          submitted with as good a grace as a lover
          can submit to any thing that crosses his
          passion.

             <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aware</hi> that her remaining in town
              at such an unusual season of the year
              would appear unaccountable to her fashionable
              acquaintance, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
              contrived for herself a characteristic excuse;
              she declared that there was no
              possibility of finding pleasure in any
              thing but novelty, and that the greatest
              novelty to her would be to remain a
              whole summer in town. Most of her
              <ecda:persGroup>friends</ecda:persGroup>, amongst whom she had successfully
              established a character for caprice,
              were satisfied that this was merely some
              new whim, practised to signalize herself
              by singularity. The real reason that detained
              her was her dependance upon
              the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="doctor">quack</ecda:anonPers>, who had repeatedly visited,
              and constantly prescribed for her. Convinced
              however by the dreadful situation
              
              
              to which is prescriptions had lately reduced
              her, that he was unworthy of her
              confidence, she determined to dismiss
              him: but she could not do this, as she
              had a considerable sum to pay him, till
              <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName> return, because she could not
              trust any one but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to let him up
              the private staircase into the boudoir.                 
             </p>   
             <p>During <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName> absence, her ladyship
              sufferend no one to attend her but a
              <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="maid" a-gender="female">maid</ecda:anonPers> who was remarkable for her stupidity.
              She thought that she could have
              nothing to fear from this girl's spirit of
              inquiry, for never was any human being 
              so destitute of curiosity. It was about
              noon when <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> and <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> arrived.
              <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> who had passed a restless
              night, was asleep. When she awoke,
              she found <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> standing beside her
              bed—
             </p>
             <p><said>Then it is all in vain, I see?</said> cried

           and she clasped her hands with ecstacy.

          <p><said>Shall I tell her, my lady, that you
          are awake?</said>

          my lord be told that I wish to speak with
          him—that I beg he will breakfast with me

           <p><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> in vain represented, that she
           ought not to hurry herself in her present
           weak state. Intent upon her own thoughts,
           she listened to nothing that was said,
           but frequently urged <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to be
           expeditious. She put on an unusual
           quantity of rouge; then looking at
           herself in the glass she said with a forced
           smile—
           </p>
           <p><said><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, I look so charmingly, that
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, perhaps, will be of <persName ref="#md">lord
           Delacour's</persName> opinion, and think that nothing
           is the matter with me. Ah, no!—
           She has been behind the scenes, she knows
           the truth too well!—<persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, pray did
           she ask you many questions about me?
           —Was not she very sorry to leave <placeName>Oakly-
           park</placeName>?—Were not they all extremely con-
           
           
           
           cerned to part with her?—Did she ask
           after <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>? Did you tell her that I
           insisted upon my lord's parting with
           <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>.</said>               
           </p>     
           <p>At the word <mentioned>Champfort</mentioned>, <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName>
            mouth opened eagerly, and she began to
            answer with her usual volubility. <persName ref="#ld">Lady

            various questions which, in the hurry of

            swiftly by <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, she threw open the
            door of her dressing-room. At the sight
            of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> she stopped short; and, totally
            overpowered, she would have sunk upon

            her in her arms, and supported her to
            a sofa. When she came to herself, and
            heard the soothing tone of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> voice,
            she looked up timidly in her face for a
            few moments without being able to speak.

           <p><said>And are you really here once more,

           And do you forgive me?—Yes, I <emph>see</emph> you

          of my suspicions! Of all tempers, that
          which appears to me, and I am sure to
          you, the most despicable, the most intolerable,
          is a suspicious temper. Mine 
          was once open, generous as your own

         you in thinking, that a suspicious tember
         is despicable and intolerable, but there is
         a vast difference between an acute fit of 
         
         
         jealous, as our friend <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName> would
         say, and a chronic habit of suspicion. The
         noblest natures may be worked up to suspicion
         by designing villany; and then a

        <p><said>That indeed would admit of no excuse,</said>
         said<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; <said>therefore you will

         something like affection for your <rs type="person" ref="#hd">little

         I mean your worst, to make me believe

        </p>        
        <p><said>That was quite another affair, my

        there is no hope of mistake with my poor
        husband. Your own sense must show you,
        that <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> is not a man to be
        loved.</said>            
        </p>        
        <p><said>That could not <emph>always</emph> have been your
        
        
        ladyship's opinion,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, with an
         arch smile. 
        </p>        
        <p><said>Lord, my dear!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
        a little embarrassed, <said>in the highest paroxysm
        of my madness, I never suspected
        that you could <emph>love</emph> <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>. I
        surely only hinted that you were in love
        with his coronet. That was absured enough 
        in all conscience. Don't make me more
        absured than I am.</said>
        </p>        
        <p><said>Is it then the height of absurdity to
        love a husband?</said>            
        </p>       
        <p><said>Love! Nonsense!—Impossible!—
        Hush!—Here he comes, with his odious
        creaking shoes. What man can ever
        expect to be loved who wears creaking
        shoes?</said>—pursued <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, as <persName ref="#md">lord
        Delacour</persName> entered the room, his shoes
        creaking at every step; and assuming an
        air of levity, she welcomed him as a
        stranger to her dressing-room. <said>No
        speeches, my lord! no speeches, I beseech
        you,</said> cried she, as he was beginning to
        speak to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. <said>Believe me
        that explanations always make bad worse.
        <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> is here, thank Heaven, and
        her!—And <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> is gone—Thank
        you—or your boots. And how let us
        
        
        sit down to breakfast, and forget as 
        soon as possible every thing that is disagreeable.</said>
        </p>
        <p>When <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had a mind to
        banish painful recollections, it was scarcely
        possible to resist the magical influence
        of her conversation and manners; yet <rs type="person" ref="#md">her
        lord's</rs> features never relaxed to a smile
        during this breakfast. He maintained an
        obstinate silence, and a profound solemnity
        —till at last, rising from table, he turned
        to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, and said,             
        </p>         
        <p><said>Of all the caprices of fine ladies, that
        which surprise me the most is the whim
        of keeping their beds without being sick.
        Now, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, youwould hardly 
        suppose that my <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, who has
        been so lively this morning, has kept her
        bed, as I am informed, a fortnight—Is not
        this astonishing?</said>            
        </p>        
        <p><said>Prodigiously astonishing, that my
        <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, like all the rest of the
        world, should be liable to be deceived by
        appearances,</said> cried <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs>. <said>Honour
        me with your attention for a few
        minutes, my lord, and perhaps I may increase
        your astonishment.</said>            
        </p>        
        <p><rs type="person" ref="#md">His lordship</rs>, struck by the sudden
            
            
         change of her voice from gayety to gravity,
         fixed his eyes upon her, and returned
         to his seat. She paused—then addressing
         herself to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>:—<said>My incomparable
         friend,</said> said she, <said>I will now give
         you a convincing proof of the unlimited
         power you have over my mind. My lord, 
         <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> has persuaded me to the
         step which I am now going to take. She 
         has prevailed upon me to make a decisive
         trial of your prudence and kindness. She
         has determined me to throw myself on
         your mercy.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Mercy!</said> repeated <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, and
         a confused idea, that she was now about to
         make a confession of the justice of some
         of his former suspicions, took possession
         of his mind: he looked aghast.            
        </p> 
       <p><said>I am going, my lord, to confide to
       you a secret of the utmost importance—
       a secret which is known to but three
       people in the world, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName>,
       and a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="doctor" a-gender="male">man</ecda:anonPers> whose name I cannot
       reveal to you.</said>           
       </p>  
        <p><said>Stop, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!</said> cried <rs type="person" ref="#md">his lordship</rs>,
        with a degree of emotion and energy
        which he had never shown till now.
        <said>Stop, I conjure, I  command you, ma-
        
        
        
        dama—I am not sufficiently master of myself
        —I once loved you too well to bear
        such a stroke. Trust me with no such
        secret—say no more—you have said
        enough, too much. I forgive you, that
        is all I can do; but we msut part <persName ref="#ld">lady
        Delacour</persName>!</said> said he, breaking from her
        with agony expressed in his countenance. 
        </p> 
        <p><said>The <rs ref="#md" type="person">man</rs> has a heart, a soul, I protest!
        —You knew him better than I did,
        <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. Nay, you are not gone 
        yet, my lord! You really love me, I find.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>No, no, no,</said> cried he vehemently.
        <said>Weak as you take me to be, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
        I am incapable of loving a woman
        who has disgraced me, disgraced herself,
        her family, her station, her high endowments,
        her—</said>
        </p> 
        <p><said>I meant not,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, <said>to
        trifle. I am satisfied. My lord, it is
        time that you should be satisfied. I <emph>can</emph>
        give you the most irrefragable proof that,
        whatever my have been the apparent
        levity of my conduct, you have had no
        serious cause for jealousy. But the
        
        
        proof will shock—disgust you.—Have
        you courage to know more?—Then follow
        me.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p>He followed her.—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> heard the
         boudoir door unlock.—In a few minutes
         they returned.—Grief, and horror, and
         pity were painted in <rs ref="#md" type="person">lord Delacour's</rs> countenance,
         as he passed hastily through the 
         room.
        </p> 
        <p><said>My dearest friend, I have taken your
        advice: would to Heaven I had taken it
        sooner!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
        <said>I have revealed to <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>
        my real situation. Poor man! he was
        shocked beyond expression. He behaved
        incomparably well. I am convinced that
        he would, as he said, let his hand be cut
        off to save my life. The moment his
        foolish jealousy was extinguished, his love
        for me revived in full force. Would you
        believe it? he has promised me to break
        with odious <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. Upon my
        charging him to keep my secret from her,
        he instantly, in the handsomest manner
        in the world, decared he would never see
        her more, rather than give me a moment's
        uneasiness. How I reproach myself for
        
        
        
        having been for years the torment of this
        man's life!</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>You may do better than reproach
        yourself, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!</said> said
        <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>: <said>you may yet live for years to
        be the blessing and pride of his life. I
        am persuaded, that nothing but your despair
        of obtaining domestic happiness has
        so long enslaved you to dissipation; and 
        now that you find a friend in your husband,
        now that you know the affectionate 
        temper of your little <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, you will
        have fresh views and fresh hopes; you will
        have the courage to live for yourself, and
        not for what is called the word.</said>    
        </p> 
        <p><said><mentioned>The world</mentioned>!</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         with a tone of disdain; <said>how long has
         that word enslaved a soul formed for
         higher purposes!</said> She paused, and looked
         up towards Heaven with an expression of
         fervent devotion, which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had once,
         and but once before seen in her countenance.
         Then, as if forgetful even that
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was present, she threw herself
          upon a sofa, and fell, or seemed to fall,
          into a profound reverie. <seg ana="#medical">She was roused
          by the entrance of <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, who came
            
            
         into the room to ask whether she would
         now take her laudanum. <said>I thought I
         had taken it,</said> said she, in a feeble voice;
         and as she raised her eyes and saw <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
         she added, with a faint smile,
         <said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>, I believe, has been laudanum
         to me this morning: but even that
         will not do long, you see; nothing will
         do for me now but <emph>this</emph>,</said> and she stretched 
         out her hand for the laudanum. <said>Is 
         not it shocking to think,</said> continued she,
         after she had swallowed it, <said>that in Laudanum
         alone I find the means of supporting
         existence?</said> </seg>  
        </p> 
        <p>She put her hand to her head, as if
         partly conscious of the confusion of her
         own ideas; and ashamed that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         should witness it, she desired <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to
         assist her to rise, and to support her to her
         bed-chamber. She made a sign to <persName ref="#bp">miss
         Portman</persName> not to follow her. <said>Do not
         take it unkindly, but I am quite exhausted,
         and wish to be alone,; for I am grown
         fond of being alone some hours in the
         day, and perhaps I shall sleep.</said>
        </p> 
       <p><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> came out of her lady's room
        about a quarter of am hour afterward, and
        said, that her lady seemed disposed to
        
        
        Sleep, but that she desired to have her
        book left by her bed-side. <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName>
        searched among several which lay upon 
        the table, for one in which a mark  was put.
        <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> looked over them along with <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,
        and she was surprised to find that
        they had almost all methodistical titles.
        <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> mark was in the middle
        of <title rend="italic" ref="#wesley_admonitions"><persName ref="#john_wesley_1703">Wesley's</persName> Admonitions</title>. Several
        pages in other books of the same description
        <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> found marked  
        with a pencil, with reiterated lines, which she
        knew to be her ladyship's customary mode
        of distinguishing passages that she particularly
        liked. Some were highly oratoricial,
        but most of them were of a mystical
        cast, and appeared to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> scarcely
        intelligible. She had reason the be astonished
        at meeting with such books in the 
        dressing-room of a woman of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
        character. During the solitude of
        her illness, her ladyship had first begun
        to think seriously on religious subjects,
        and the early impressions that had been
        ade on her mind in her childhood, by a
        methodistical mother, recurred. Her understanding,
        weakened perhaps by disease,
        and never accustomed to reason, was in-
        
        
        
        capable of distinguishing between truth
        and error; and her temper, naturally enthusiastic,
        hurried her from one extreme
        to the other—from thoughtless skepticism
        to visionary credulity. Her devotion was
        by no means stay or permanent; it
        came on by fits usually at the time when
        the effect of laudanum was exhausted, or
        before a fresh dose began to operate. In
        these intervals she was low-spirited—bitter
        reflexions on the manner in which she
        had thrown away her talents and her life 
        obtruded themselves; the idea of the untimely
        death of <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>, of which
        she reproached herself as the cause, returned;
        and her mind, from being a prey
        to remorse, began to sink in these desponding
        monments under the most dreadful
        susperstitious terrors–terrors the more
        powerful, as they were secret. Whilst the
        stimulus of laudanum lasted, the train of
        her ideas always changed, and she was 
        amazed at the weak fears and strange notions
        by which she had been disturbed;
        yet it was not in her power entirely to
        chase away these visions of the night, and
        they gained gradually a dominion over 
        her, of which she was heartily ashamed.
        
        
        She resolved to conceal this <emph>weakness</emph>, as
        in her gayer moments she thought it,
        from <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, from whose superior strength
        of understanding she dreaded ridicule or
        contempt. Her experience of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName>
        gentleness and friendship might
        reasonably have prevented or dispelled
        such apprehensions; but <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
        was governed by pride, by sentiment, by
        whim, by enthusiasm, by passion—by any
        thing but reaosn. 
       </p>  
       <p>When she began to revive after her fit
        of languor, and had been refreshed by
        opium and sleep, she rang for <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,
        and inquired for <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. She was much
        provoked when <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, by way of proving
        to her that <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> could not
        have been tired of being left alone, told
        her, that she had been in the dressing-
        room <quote rend="italic">rummaging over the books</quote>.
       </p>  
        <p><said>What books?</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.
         <said>I forgot that <emph>they</emph> were left there. <persName ref="#bp">Miss
         Portman</persName> is not reading them still, I suppose?
         Go for them, and let them be locked
         up in my own book-case, and bring me
         the key.</said>   
        </p> 
         <p><rs type="person" ref="#ld">Her ladyship</rs> appeared in good spirits
         when she saw <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> again. She rallied
             
             
             
         her upon the serious studies she had
         chosen for her morning's amusements.
         <said>Thoses methodistical books, with their
         strange quaint titles,</said> said she, <said>are however,
         diverting enough to those who, like
         myself, can find diversion in the height of
         human absurdity.</said>
         </p>
         <p>Deceived by the levity of her manner,
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> concluded that the marks of approbation
           in these books were ironical, and
           she thought no more of the matter; for
           <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> suddenly gave a new turn
             to the conversation by exclaiming,
         </p>
         <p><said>Now we talk of the height of human
         absurdity, what are we to think of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
         Hervey</persName>?</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>Why should we think ofh im at all?</said>
          said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.
         </p>
         <p><said>For two excellent reasons, my dear!
         because we cannot help it, and because he
         deserves it. Yes, he deserves it, believe
         me, if it were only for having written me
         these charming letters,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         opening a cabinet, and taking out
         a small packet of letters, which she put
         into <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> hands. <said>Pray read them,
         you will find them amazingly edifying, as
         well as entertaining. I protest I am only
         
         
         puzzled to know, whether I shall bind
         them up with <title ref="#sterne_sentimental"><persName ref="#laurence_sterne_1713">Sterne's</persName> Sentimental Journey</title>,
         or <title><persName ref="#james_fordyce_1720">Fordyce's</persName> Sermons for Young
         Women</title>. Here, my love, if you like description,</said>
         continued her ladyship opening 
         one of the letters, <said>here is a <rs ref="#ann_radcliffe_1764" type="properAdjective">Radcliffean</rs>
         tour along the picturesque coasts of <placeName>Dorset</placeName>
         and <placeName>Devonshire</placeName>.Why he went this
         tour, unless for the pleasure and glory of
         describing it, Heaven knows! Clouds and
         darkness rest over the tourist's private history;
         but this, of course, renders his letters
         more <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">piquantes</foreign> and interesting. All 
         who have a just taste either for literature
         or for gallantry, know how much we are
         indebted to the obscure for the sublime,
         and orators and lovers feel what felicity
         there is in the use of the fine figure of suspension.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Very good description indeed!</said> said
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, without raising her eyes from
          the letter or seeming to pay any attention
          to the latter part of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
          speech, <said>very good description, certainly!</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Well, my dear! but here is something
         better than <quote rend="italic" source="#pope_arbuthnot">pure descrption</quote>; here is
         sense for you: and pray mark the po-
         
         
         liteness of addressing sense to a woman
         —to a woman of sense, I mean—and
         which of us is not? Then here is sentiment
         for you,</said> continued <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs>,
         spreading another letter before <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>;
         <said>a story of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female"><placeName>Dorsetshire</placeName> lady</ecda:anonPers>, who had
         the misfortune to be married to a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">man</ecda:anonPers> as
         <emph>unlike</emph> <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, and as like <persName ref="#md">lord
         Delacour</persName>, as possible; and yet, O, wonderful!
         they make as happy a couple as
         one's heart could wish. Now, I am truly
         candid and good natured to admire this
         letter; for every word of it is a lesson to
         me, and evidently was so intended. But
         I take it all in good part, because, to do
         <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> justice, he describes the joys of
         domestic Paradise in such elegant language,
         that he does not make me sick.
         In short, my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, to finish my
         panegyric, as it has been seaid of some
         other epistles, if ever there were letters
         calculated to make you fall in love with
         the writer of them, these are they.</said>
         </p>
        <p><said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, folding
        up the letter which she was just going to 
        read, <said>I will not run the hazard of reading
        them.</said>
        </p> 
       <p><said>Why, my dear!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           
           
           
        
        with a look of mingled concern, reproach,
        and raillery, <said>have you actually given
        up my <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, merely on account
        of this mistress in the wood, this <persName ref="#vs">Virginia
        St. Pierre</persName>? Nonsense! Begging your 
        pardon, my dear, the man loves you. 
        Some entanglement, some punctilio, some
        doubt, some delicacy, some foly, prevents
        him from being just at this moment,
        where, I confess, he ought to be,—at your
        feet—and you, out of patience, which a
        young lady ought never to be if she can
        help it, will go amd marry—I know you
        will—some stick of a rival purely to provoke
        him.</said>           
       </p> 
       <p><said>If ever I marry,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> with a
        look of proud humility, <said>I shall certainly
        marry to please myself, and not to provoke
        any body else—and at all events I hope I
        shall never marry <emph>a stick</emph>.</said>           
       </p>  
       <p><said>Pardon me that word,</said> <choice><sic>laid</sic><corr>said</corr></choice> <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
       <said>I am convinced that you never will
       —but one is apt to judge of others by one's
       self. I am willing to believe that <persName ref="#v">Mr. 
       Vincent</persName>—</said>    
       </p>  
       <p><said><persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>! How did you know—</said>
        exclaimed <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.
       </p>  
       <p><said xml:id="s025" next="#s026">How did I know? Why, my dear, do
        
       
       
       you think I am so little interested about
       you, that I have not found out some of
       yoru secrets? And do you think that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
       could refrain from telling me, in her
       most triumphant tone, that <said><persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
       has not gone to <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> for
       nothing; that she has made a conquest of
       a <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, a <name>West Indian</name>, a ward, or
       lately a ward, of <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival's</persName>, the handsomest
       man that ever was seen, and the
       richest, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</said></said>           
       </p>  
       <p><said prev="#s025" xml:id="s026">Now, simple, I rejoiced at the news;
       for I took it for granted, you would never seriously
       think of marrying the man.</said>           
       </p> 
      <p><said>Then why did your ladyship rejoice?</said>          
      </p>   
      <p><said>Why? O, you novice at <name>Cupid's</name>
      chess-board! do you not see the next
      move? Check with tyour new knight,
      and the game is your own. Now, if
      your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName> saw your look at
      this instant, she would give you up for
      ever—if she has not done that already.
      In plain unmetaphorical prose, then, cannot
      you comprehend, my straight-forward
      <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, that if you make <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
      Hervey</persName> heartily jealous, let the impediments
      to your union be what they may,
      
      
      
      he will acknowledge himself to be heartily
      in love with you? I should make no scruple
      of frightening him within an inch of
      his life, for his good. <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip Baddely</persName>
      was not the man to frighten him; but
      this <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, by all accounts, is just
      the thing.</said>          
      </p>   
      <p><said>And do you imagine that I could use
      <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName> so ill?—And can you think
      me capable of such double dealing?</said>          
      </p>   
      <p><said>O! in love and war, you know, all
      strategems are allowable.—But you take
      the matter so seriously, and you redden
      with such virtuous indignation, that I dare
      not say a word more—Only—may I ask
      —are you absolutely engaged to <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>?</said>          
      </p>   
       <p><said>No. We have had the prudence to
       avoid all promises, all engagements.</said>           
       </p>  
       <p><said>There's my good girl!</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady
       Delacour</persName>, kissing her: <said>all may yet turn
       out well—Read those letters—Take
       them to your room, read them, read
       them; and depend upon it, my dearest
       <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>! you are not the sort of woman
       that will, that can be happy, if you make
       a mere match of convenience.—Forgive
       me, I love you too well not to speak the
       
       
       truth, though it may offend for a moment.</said>           
       </p>  
        <p><said>You do not offend, but you misunderstand
        me,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>Have patience
        with me, and you shall find that I
        am incapable of making a mere match of 
        convenience.</said>            
        </p> 
         <p>Then <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> gave <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
          a simple but full account of all that
          had passed at <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> relative to <persName ref="#v">Mr. 
          Vincent</persName>. She repeated the arguments by
          which <persName ref="#ap">lady Annd Percival</persName> had first prevailed
          upon her to admit of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName>
          addresses. She said, that she had been
          convinced by <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName>, that the omnipotence
          of a <emph>first love</emph> was an idea
          founded in folly, and realized only in
          romance; and that to believe that none
          could be happy in marriage, except with
          the first object of their fancy or their
          affections, who would be an errour pernicious
          to individuals and to society.—
          When she detailed the arguments used
          by <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> on this subject, <persName ref="#ld">lady
          Delacour</persName> sighed, and observed that <persName ref="#hp">Mr.
          Percival</persName> was certainly right, judging from
          <emph>his own experience</emph>, to declaim against the
          folly of <emph>first loves</emph>; <said>and for the same
          
          
          reason,</said> added she, <said>perhaps I may be
          pardoned if I retain some prejudice in
          their favour.</said> She turned aside her head
          to hide a starting tear, and here the conversation
          dropped. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, recollecting
          the circumstances of her ladyship's early
          history, reproached herself for having
          touched on this tender subject, yet at the
          same time she felt with increased force,
          at this moment, the justice of <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival's</persName>
          observations; for, evidently, the
          hold which this prejudice had kept in
          <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> mind had materially injured
          her happiness, by making her neglect,
          after her marriage, all the means of
          content that were in her reach. Her incessant
          comparisons between her <emph>first love</emph>
          and her husband excited perpetual contempt
          and disgust in her mind for her
          wedded lord, and for many years precluded
          all perception of his good qualities,
          all desire to live with him upon good
          terms, and all idea of securing that share
          of domestic happiness that was actually
          in her power. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> resolved at some
          future moment, whenever she could, with
          propriety and with effect, to suggest these
          reflections to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, and in the
             
             
          
          
          mean time she was determined to turn
          them to her own advantage. She perceived 
          that she should have need of her all her
          steadiness to preserve her judgment unbiassed
          by her ladyship's with and persuasive
          eloquence on the one hand, and on the
          other by her own high opinion of <persName ref="#ap">lady
          Anne Percival's</persName> judgment, and the anxious
          desire she felt to secure her approbation.
          The letters from <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> she read
          at night, when she retired to her own
          room; and they certainly raised not only
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> opinion of his talents, but her
          esteem for his character. She saw that
          he had, with great address, made use of
          the influence he possessed over <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
          to turn her mind to every thing
          that could make her amiable, estimable,
          and happy—she saw that <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, so
          far from attempting, for the samke of his
          own vanity, to retain his pre-eminence
          in her ladyships imagination, used on the
          contrary, <quote source="#wotton_happy" rend="quotes">his utmost skill</quote> to turn the
          tide of her affections toward her <rs ref="#md" type="person">her husband</rs>
          and <rs type="person" ref="#hd">her daughter</rs>. In one of his
          letters, and but in one, he mentioned
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. He expressed great regret at
           hearing from <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, that her
             
             
          
          friend <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> was no longer
          with her. He expatiated on the inestimable
          advantages and happiness of having
          such a friend—but this referred to <persName ref="#ld">lady
          Delacour</persName>, not to himself. There was an
          air of much respect and some embarrassment
          in all he said of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, but nothing
          like love. A few words at the end
          of this paragraph were cautiously obliterated,
          however; and, without any obvious
          link of connexioon, the writer began
          a new sentence with a general reflexion
          upon the folly and imprudence of forming
          romantic projects. Then he enumerated
          some of the various schemes he had
          formed in his early youth, and humourously
          recounted how they had failed, or
          how they had been abandoned. Afterward,
          changing his tone from playful wit
          to serious philosophy, he observed the
          changes which these experiments had
          made in his own character.

         <p><quote rend="quotes">My friend <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>,</quote> said he,
         <quote  rend="quotes">divides mankined into three classes.—
         Those who learn from the experience of
         others—They are happy men.—Those
         who learn from their own experience—
         They are wise men.—And, lastly, those
         
         
         
         who learn neither from their own nor
         from other people's experience—They are
         fools.—This class is by far the largest.

         However, were it in my power to choose
         my own character, I should, forgive me
         the seeming vanity of the speech, still be

         because they must depend for their
         pprogress on the experiments that we brave
         volunteers, at whose expense they are to
         live and learn, are pleased to try. There
         may be much safety in thus snugly
         fighting, or rather seeing the battle of
         life, behind the broad shield of a stouter

         <p>Though <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had been much
         fatigued by the exertion of her spirits
         during the day, she sat up at night to
         write to <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Her love and gratitude
         to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> interested her
         most warmly for her happiness, and she
         was persuaded that the most effectual

         her union with her <emph>first love</emph>. <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>,
         who had also the best opinion of
         <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and the most sincere
          friendship for him, thought she was likewise
          acting highly for his interest; and
          she felt that she had some merit in at
          once parting him from the train of her
          admirers, and urging him to be come a
          dull married man. Besides these generous
          motives, she was, perhaps, a little
          influenced by jealousy of the superior

          right of science and reason, have taken
          possession of the head, and a <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent</persName>, 
          their ci-devant ward and declared
          favourite, has laid close siege to the
          heart, of which he is in a fair way, I 
          think, to take possession by the right of
          conquest. As far as I can understand—
          for I have not yet seen <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">le futur</foreign>—he deserves
          my <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>: for, besides being as
          handsome as any hero of romance, ancient
          or modern, he has a soul in which
          
          
          
          neither spot or blemish can be found,
          except the amiable weakness of being
          desperately in love—a weakness which
          we ladies are apt to prefer to the most
          philosophic stoicism—a propose of philosophy
          —We may presume, that nonwithstanding
          <persName ref="#v">Mr. V―</persName> is a creole, he has
          been bred up by his guardian in the class
          of men who learn by the experience of
          others. As such, according to your system,
          he has a right to expect to be a
          <quote rend="italic">happy man</quote>, has not he? According to
          <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> system, I am sure that
          he has: for his thousands and tens of
          thousands, as I am credibly informed,
          pass the comprehension of the numeration
          table.</quote>

          <p>But these will weigh not a grain in
         the estimation of her truly disinterested
         and noble-minded niece. <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
          knows nothing of <persName ref="#v">Mr. Vincent's</persName> proposals;
          and it is well for him she does not, for
          her worldly good word would mar the

          Percival's</persName>—Their opinion is
          all in all with my friend. How they have
          contrived it I know not, but they have
          gained over <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mind a degree of 
              
              
          
          
          power almost equal to parental authority.
          So you may guess that the doubtful beam
          will not much longer nod from side to side.
          Indeed it seems to me scarcely necessary
          to throw in the sword of authority to turn
          the scale.

         <p>After <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had finished this
          letter, which she had no doubt would
          bring <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> immediately to town, she
          left it with <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, with orders to have
           it sent by the next post. Much fatigued,
          she then retired to rest, and was not visible
          the next day till dinner-time. When
          <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> returned the packet of <persName ref="#ch">Mr.

         <p><said>So, they have made a complete philosopher

         </p>
         <p><said>Rather to be lighted there, if possible,</said>
         said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; and she endeavoured
         to turn the conversation to what she
         thought must be more immediately interesting
         to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—her own
         health. She assured her, with perfect

         <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> sighed, and opened
         <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> letters one after another,
          looking over them without speaking,
          and without seeming well to know
          what she was about. <persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName>
             
             
             
         came into the room whilst these letters
         were still in her hand. He had been
         absent since the preceeding morning, and
         he now seemed as if he was just come
         home much fatigued. He began in a
         tone of great anxiety to inquire after
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> health. She was piqued
         at his having left home at such a time,
         and, merely bowing her head to him, she
         went on reading. His eyes glanced upon
         the letters which she held in her hand;
         and when he saw the well-known writing
         of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, his manner immediately
         altered, and, stammering out
         some commonplace phrases, he threw
         himself into an arm-chair by the fire-side,
         protesting that he was tired to death–
         that he was half dead—that he had been
         in a postchaise for three hours, which
         he hated—had ridden <measure>fifty miles</measure> since
         yesterday—and he muttered that he was
         a fool for his pains;—an observation,
         which, though it reached her ladyship's 
         ears, she did not think proper to contradict.
         </p>
         <p>His lordhip had then recourse to his
         watch, his never-failing friend in need,
         
         
         
         which he always pulled out with a particular
         jerk when he was vexed.             
         </p>
         <p><said>It is time for me to be gone—I shall
         be late at <persName ref="#studley_0001">Studley's</persName>.</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>You dine with <rs ref="#studley_0001" type="person">his lordship</rs>, then?</said>
         said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> in a careless tone.
         </p>
         <p><said>Yes; and his good <ecda:food>burgundy</ecda:food>, I 
         hope, will wind me up again,</said> said he,
         stretching himself, <said>for I am quite
         down.</said></p>
         <p><said>Quite down?—Then we may conclude 
         that my friend <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>  is
         not yet come to <placeName rend="italic">Rantipole</placeName>?...<placeName>Rantipole</placeName>,

         strange it may sound to your ears
         and mine, I can assure you the name has
         <emph>made fortune</emph> amongst a certain description
         of wits. And candour must allow
         that, if not elegant, it is appropriate; it
         gives a just idea of the manners and way
         of life in the place, for every thing at
         <placeName>Rantipole</placeName> is rantipole. But I am really
         concerned, my lord, you should have ridden
         yourself down in this way for nothing.
         Why did not you get better in-
         
         
         
         telligence before you set out? I am afraid
         you feel the loss of <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>. Why
         did not you contrive to learn for certain,
         my dear good lord, whether <persName ref="#luttridge_0001" rend="italic">the Luttridge</persName>\
         was at <placeName>Rantipole</placeName>, before you set out on
         this wild goose chace?</said></p>
         <p><said>My dear good lady,</said> replied <persName rend="#md">lord
         Delacour</persName>, assuming a degree of spirit
          which startled her as much as it became
          him, <said>why do you not get better intelligence
          before you suspect me of being
          a brute and a liar! Did not I promise
          you yesterday, that I would break with
          <persName rend="italic" ref="#luttridge_0001">the Luttridge</persName>, as you call her? and how
          could you imagine that the instant afterwards,
          just at the time I was wrung to
          the soul, as you know I was—how could
          you imagine I would leave you to go to
          <placeName>Rantipole</placeName>, or to any woman on earth?</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>O, my lord! I beg your pardon, I
         beg your pardon a thousand times,</said> cried
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, rising with much emotion;
          and, going towards him with a sudden
          impulse, she kissed his forehead.
         </p>
         <p><said>And so you ought to beg my pardon,</said>
          said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> in a faltering
          voice, but without moving his posture. 
         </p>
                 
                 
                 
         <p><said>You will acknowledge you left me,
         however, my lord? That is clear.</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>Left you! Yes, so I did; to ride all
         over the country in search of a house that 
         would suit you. For what else did you
         think I <emph>could</emph> leave you at such a time as
         this?</said>             
         </p>
         <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> again stooped, and leaned
          her arm upon his shoulder.
         </p>
         <p><said>I wish to Heaven, my dear,</said> said
          <rs ref="#md" type="person">his lordship</rs>, shrinking as he put away
           her hand, which still held <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName>
           letters—<said>I wish to Heaven, my
           dear, you would not hold those abominable
           perfumed papers just under my very
           nose. You know I cannot stand perfumes.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Are they perfumed? Ay; so every
         thing is that I keep in that cabinet of
         curiosities. Thank you, my dear <persName ref="#bp">miss

          rose to take the letters from her hand.
         <said>Will you have the goodness to put
         them back into their cabinet, if you can
         endure to touch them, if the perfume has
         not overcome you, as well as <rs type="person" ref="#md">my lord</rs>.
         After all, it is only ottar of <ecda:flora>roses</ecda:flora>, to which
         
         
         
         few peoples olfactory nerves have an antipathy.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>I have the honour to be one of the
         few,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#md">his lordship</rs>, rising from his
         seat with so sudden a motion as to displace
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> arm which leaned
         upon him. <said>For my part,</said> continued
         he, taking down one of the <persName ref="#aime_argand_1750">Argand's</persName> 
         lamps from the chimney piece, and trimming
         it, <said>I would rather a hundred to 
         one snuff up the oil of this cursed lamp.</said>             
         </p>
         <p>Whilst <rs type="person" ref="#md">his lordship</rs> applied himself to
          trimming the lamp with great earnestness,
          <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> negligently walked
          away to the farthest end of the room,
          where stood the cabinet, which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>   
          was trying to unlock.
         </p>
         <p><said>Stay, my love, it has a secret lock,
         which I alone can manage.</said></p>
         <p><said>O, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>!</said> whispered
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, holding her hand as she
          gave her the key, <said>I never can love or
          esteem you, if you use <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> ill
          now.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Ill now? Ill how? This lock is spoilt,
         I do believe,</said> said she aloud.             
         </p>
         <p><said>Nay, you understand me, <persName ref="#ld">lady Dela-
         
         
         
         cour</persName>! You see what is passing in his
         mind.</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>To be sure. I am not a fool, though
         he is. I see his is jealous, though he has
         had such <emph>damning proof</emph>—thatall's right
         —The man's a fool, that's all. Are you
         sure this is the key I gave you, my dear?</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>And can you think him a fool,</said> pursued
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> in a still more earnest whisper,   
          <said>for being more jealous of your mind
          than of your person? Fools have seldom so
          much penetration, or so much delicacy.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>But, Lord! what would you have
         me do? what would you have me say?
         That <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> writes better letters
         thane these?</said>             
         </p>
        <p><said>O no!—But show him these letters,
        and you will do justice to him, to
        yourself, to <persName ref="#ch">Cla—</persName>, to every body.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>I am sure I should be happy to do 
        justice to <emph>every body</emph>.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Then pray do this very instant, my

        you for it all my life.</said>            
        </p> 
         <p><said>Done!—for who can withstand that
         offer? Done!</said> said <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs>; then
         turning to <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, <said>My lord, will
         
         
         you come here and tell us what can be
         the matter with this lock?</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>If the lock be spoiled, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         you had better send for a locksmith</said>
         replied <rs type="person" ref="#md">his Lordship</rs>, who was
         still employed about the wick of the <persName ref="#aime_argand_1750">Argand</persName>.
         <said>I am no locksmith—I do not
         pretend to understand locks—especially

         </p>
         <p><said>But you will not desert us at our

         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, approaching him with a conciliatory
         smile. 
         </p>
         <p><said>You want the light, I believe, more
         than I do,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#md">his lordship</rs>, advancing
         with the lamp to meet her. <said>Well! 
         what is the matter with this confounded
         lock of yours, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>? I know
         I should be at <persName ref="#studley_0001">Studley's</persName> by this time—
         but how in the devil's name can you expect 
         me to open a secret lock when I
         do not know the secret, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>?</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>Then I will tell you the secret, <persName ref="#md">lord
         Delacour</persName>—that there is no secret at all
         in the lock, or in the letters. Here, if
         you can stand the odious smell of ottar of 
         <ecda:flora>roses</ecda:flora>, take these letters and read them,
         
         
         
         foolish man; and keep them till the
         shocking perfume is gone off.</said>             
         </p>
         <p><persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName> could scarcely believe
          his senses, he looked in <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
          eyes to see whether he had understood
          her rightly.
         </p>
         <p><said>But I am afraid,</said> said she, smiling,
         <said>that you will find the perfume too overcoming.</said></p>
         <p><said>Not half so overcoming,</said> cried he,
         seizing her hand, and kissing it often with
         eager tenderness—<said>not half so overcoming
         as this confidence, this kindness, this
         condescension from you.</said>
         </p>
        <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> will think us both a
         couple of old fools,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>,
         making a slight effort to withdraw her
         hand. <said>But she is almost as great a
         simpleton herself, I think,</said> continued
         she, observing that the tears stood in
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> eyes. 
        </p> 
        <p><said>My lord,</said> said a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">footman</ecda:anonPers> who
         came in at this instant, <said>do you dress?
         The carriage is at the door, as you ordered,
         to go to <persName ref="#studley_0001">lord Studley's</persName>.</said>
        </p> 
        <p><said>I'd see <persName ref="#studley_0001">lord Studley</persName> at the devil, sir,
        and his <ecda:food>burgundy</ecda:food> along with him, before
        
        
        
        I'd go to him to-day; and you may tell
        him so, if you please,</said> cried <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.            
        </p> 
       <p><said>Very well, my lord!</said> said the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">footman</ecda:anonPers>.            
        </p> 
        <p><said><rs type="person" ref="#md">My lord</rs> dines at home. They may
        put up the carriage. That's all,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady 
        Delacour</persName>. <said>Only let us have dinner
        directly,</said> added she, as the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">servant</ecda:anonPers> shut
        the door. <said><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> will be famished
        amongst us. There is no living
        upon sentiment.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>And there is no living with such
        belles, without being something more of
        a beau,</said> said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, looking at
        his splashed boots, <said>I will be ready for
        dinner before dinner is ready for me.</said>
        With activity very unusual to him, he
        hurriedout of the room to change his
        dress.
        </p> 
        <p><said>O day of wonders!</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#ld">lady
        Delacour</persName>. <said>And O night of wonders!
        if we can get him through the evening
        without the help of <persName ref="#studley_0001">lord Studley's</persName> <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>.
        You must give us some music, my good
        <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, and make him accompany you
        with his flute. I can tell you he has
        really a very pretty taste for music, and
        
        
        
        knows fifty times more of the matter than
        half the dilettanti, who squeeze the human
        face divine into all manner of ridiculous 
        shapes, by way of persuading you
        that they are in ecstacy! And, my dear,
        do not forget to show us the charming
        little portfolio of drawings that you have
        brought from <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName>. <persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName>
        was with me at <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName> in the
        days his courtship: he knows the
        charming views that you have been taking
        about <placeName>Knaresborough</placeName> and <placeName>Fountain's
        Abbey</placeName>, and all those places. I will answer
        for it, he remembers them a hundred 
        times better than I do. And, my love,
        I assure you he is a better judge of drawing
        than many whom we saw ogling
        <persName ref="#venus_0001">Venus</persName> rising from the sea, in the <name>Orleans'
        gallery</name>. <persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName> has let his talents
        go to sleep in a shameless manner;
        but really he has talents, if they could
        be wakened. By the by, pray make him
        tell you the story of <persName ref="#studley_0001">lord Studley's</persName> original
        <ecda:commodity><persName ref="#titian_1488">Titian</persName></ecda:commodity>: he tells that story with real
        humour. Perhaps you have not found it
        out, but <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> has a vast deal of
        drollery in his own way, and—</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Dinner's ready, my lady!</said>            
        </p> 
         
         
         <p><said>That is a pity!</said> whispered <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>;
         <said>for, if they had let me go on
         in my present humour, I should have 
         found out that <rs type="person" ref="#md">my lord</rs> has every accomplishment
         under the sun, and every requisite
         under the moon, to make the marriage
         state happy.</said>    
         </p>
         <p>With the assistance of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> portfolio
         and her harp, and the good humour
         and sprightliness of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> with,
         his lordship got through the evening much
         to his own satisfaction. he played on
         the flute, he told the story of <persName ref="#studley_0001">Studley's</persName>
         original <ecda:commodity><persName ref="#titian_1488">Titian</persName></ecda:commodity>, and he detected a fault
         that had escaped <persName ref="#hp">Mr. Percival</persName> in the perspective
         of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> sketch of <placeName>Fountain's
         Abbey</placeName>. The perception that his
         talents were <emph>called out</emph>, and that he appeared
         to unusual advantage, made him
         <emph>excellent company</emph>: he found that the
         spirits can be raised by self-complacencey
         even more agreeable than by <ecda:food>burgundy</ecda:food>.

        the globe beside her lady, and retired.

         to keep his promise of sending it to your
         <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>. She found out in some book
         that she was reading with him last summer,
         that <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna> are fond of this <ecda:flora>plant</ecda:flora>;
         and I wish,</said> added <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> in a timid
         voice, <said>that she were here at this instant
         to see them eat it.</said>
        </p>        
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> was silent for some minutes,
         and she kept her eyes steadily upon the
         <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna>. At length she said, <said>I never
         shall forget how well the poor little creature
         behaved about those <ecda:fauna>gold fishes</ecda:fauna>. I
         grew amazingly fond of her whilst she was
         
         
         with me. But you know, circumstanced
         as I was, after you left me, I could not
         have her at home.</said>
        </p>        
        <p><said>But now I am here,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
         <said>will she be any trouble to you? And
         will she not make your home more agreeable
         to you, and to <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, who
         was evidently very fond of her?</said>               
        </p>        
        <p><said>Ah, my dear!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         <said>you forget, and so do I at times, what
         I have to go through. It is in vain to
         talk, to think of making home, or any
         place, or any thing, or any person agreeable
         to me now. What am I? The outside
         rind ise left—the sap is gone. The
         <ecda:flora>tree</ecda:flora> lasts from day to day by miralcle—it
         cannot last long. You would not wonder
         to hear me talk in this way, if you knew
         the terrible time I had last night after we
         parted. But I have these nights constantly
         now.—Let us talk of something else.
         What have you there? A manuscript?</said>
        </p>        
        <p><said>Yes, a little journal of <persName ref="#edward_percival_0001">Edward Percival's</persName>,
        which he sent for the entertainment
        of <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>.</said>            
        </p>        
         <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> stretched out her hand
         for it. <said>The <rs type="person" ref="#edward_percival_0001">boy</rs> will write as like his
         <rs type="person" ref="#hp">father</rs> as possible,</said> said she, turning over
             
             
         the leaves. <said>I wish to have this poor
         girl with me—but I have not spirits. And
         you know, whenever <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> can
         find a house that will suit us, we shall
         leave town, and I could not take <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> 
         with me. But this may be the last opportunity
         I may ever have of seeing her;
         and I <emph>can</emph> refuse you nothing, my dear.
         So, will you go for her? She can stay
         with us a few days. <persName ref="#boucher_0001">Lady Boucher</persName>, that
         most convenient dowager, who likes going
         about, no matter where, all the morning,
         will go with you to <persName ref="#dumont_0001">Mrs. Dumont's</persName> academy
         in <placeName>Sloane street</placeName>. I would as soon
         go to a <ecda:fauna>bird</ecda:fauna> fancier's as to a boarding-
         school for young ladies. Indeed I am
         not well enough to go any where. So I
         will <sic>through</sic> myself upon a sofa, and read
         this child's journal. I wonder how that
         or any thing can interest me now.</said>

         <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who had been used to the variations
          of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> spirits, was not
          much alarmed by the despondent strain 
          in which she now spoke, especially when
          she considered that the thoughts of the
          dreadful trial this unfortunate woman was
          soon to go through, must naturally depress
          her courage. Rejoiced at the per-
          
          
          
          mission that she had obtained to go for
          <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> sent immediately
          to <persName ref="#boucher_0001">lady Boucher</persName>, who took her to <placeName>Sloane
          street</placeName>. 
         </p>       
         <p><said>Now, my dear considerate <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,</said>
          said <persName ref="#boucher_0001">lady Boucher</persName>, <said>I must beg
          and request that you will hurry <persName ref="#hd">miss Delacour</persName>
          into the carriage as fast as possible.
          I have not a moment to spare; for I am
          to be at a <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">china</ecda:commodity> at two, that I
          would not miss for the whole world.
          Well, what's the matter with the people?
          Why does not <persName ref="#james_0001">James</persName> knock at the door?
          Can't the man read? Can't the man see?</said>
          cried the purblined dowager. <said>Is not
          that <persName ref="#dumont_0001">Mrs. Dumont's</persName> name on the door
          before his eyes?</said>
         </p>       
         <p><said>No, ma'am, I believe this name is

         is the next door, tell the blind 
         dunce. Mercy on us! To waste one's 
         time in this way! I shall, sure as fate,
         be too late for the <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">china</ecda:commodity> auction. What
         upon earth stops us?</said>             
         </p>       
          <p><said>Nothing but a little covered cart, which
          stands at <persName ref="#dumont_0001">Mrs. Dumont's</persName> door. There,
          
          
          
          now it is going; and <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> is drawing
          it out of the way as fast as he can.</said>              
          </p>      
          <p><said>Open the coach-door, <persName ref="#james_0001">James</persName>!</said> cried
          <persName ref="#boucher_0001">lady Boucher</persName> the moment that they had
          drawn up. <said>Now my dear considerate
          <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, remember the auction, and
          don't let <persName ref="#hd">miss Delacour</persName> stay to change her
          dress or any thing.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> promised not to detain <rs type="person" ref="#boucher_0001">her ladyship</rs>
          a minute. The door at <persName ref="#dumont_0001">Mrs. Dumont's</persName> 
          was open, and a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant" a-gender="male">servant</ecda:anonPers> was assisting
          an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> to carry in some <ecda:flora>geraniums</ecda:flora>
          and <ecda:flora>balsams</ecda:flora> out of the covered cart
          which had stopped the way. In the hall
          a <choice><sic>cowd</sic><corr>crowd</corr></choice> of <ecda:persGroup>children</ecda:persGroup> were gathered round
          a high stand, on which they were eagerly
          arranging their <ecda:flora>flower</ecda:flora>-pots; and the busy
          hum of voices was so loud, that, when
          <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> first went in, she could
           neither hear the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant" a-gender="male">servant</ecda:anonPers>, nor make him
          hear her name. Nothing was to be heard 
          but <said>O, how beautiful! O, how sweet!
          That's mine! That's your's! The great

          No, indeed <persName ref="#pococke_0001">miss Pococke</persName>, that's for <persName ref="#hd">miss
          Delacour</persName>; the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> said so.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said rend="italic"><distinct type="dialect">Silence, silence, mesdemoiselles</distinct>!</said> cried
          
          
          
          
          the voice of a <rs ref="#dumont" type="person"><rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> woman</rs>, and all was
          silence. The <ecda:persGroup>little crowd</ecda:persGroup> looked towards
          the hall door; and from the midst of her
          <ecda:persGroup>companions</ecda:persGroup>, <persName ref="#hd">Helena Delacour</persName>, who now
          caught a glimpse of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, sprang forward,
          throwng down her <ecda:flora>white <placeName>Provence</placeName> 
          rose</ecda:flora> as she passed.</p>
          <p><said><persName ref="#boucher_0001">Lady Boucher's</persName> compliments, ma'am</said>
           said the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="servant">servant</ecda:anonPers> to <persName ref="#dumont_0001">Mrs. Dumont</persName>, <said>She's
           in an indispensible haste, and she begs you
           won't let <persName ref="#hd">miss Delacour</persName> think of changing
           her dress.</said>  
          </p>
          <p>It was the lst thing of which <persName ref="#hd">miss Delacour</persName>
           was likely to think at this instant.
           She was so much overjoyed, when she
           heard that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was come by her
           mamma's desire to take her home, that
           she would scarcely stay whilst <persName ref="#dumont_0001">Mrs. Dumont</persName>
           was tying on her straw hat, and exhorting
           her to let <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> know
           how it happened that she was <said>so far
           from fit to be seen.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Yes, ma'am; yes, ma'am, I'll remember;
          I'll be sure to remember,</said> said <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>
          tripping down the steps. But just
          as she was getting into the carriage she
          stopped at the sight of the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers>, and
          exclaimed,
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p><said>O, good <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers>! I must not forget
          you.</said>              
          </p>
          <p><said>Yes, indeed you must though, my
          dear <persName ref="#hd">miss Delacour</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#boucher_0001">lady Boucher</persName>,
          pulling her into the carriage. <said>'Tis no
          time to think of good old men now.</said>              
          </p>
          <p><said>But I must. Dear <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
          will you speak for me? I must pay—I
          must settle—and I have a great deal to
          say.</said>              
          </p>
          <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> desired the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> to
           call in <placeName>Berkley-square</placeName> at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>;
           and this satisfying all parties, they drove
           away.             
          </p>
          <p>When they arrived in <placeName>Berkley-square</placeName>,
           <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> told them that <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her lady</rs> was just
           gone to lie down. <persName ref="#edward_percival_0001">Edward Percival's</persName> 
           little journal, which she had been reading,
           was left on the sofa, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> gave it
           to <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, who eagerly began to look over
           it. <said>Thirteen pages! O, how good he
           has been to write so much for me!</said> said
           she; and she had almost finished read
           it before her mother came into the room.
          </p>
         <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> shrunk back as her
           daughter ran towards her; for she recollected
           too well the agony she had once suffered
           from an embrace of <persName ref="#hd">Helena's</persName> The
             
             
             
          little girl appeared more grieved than surprised
          at this; and after kissing her mother's
          hand, without speaking, she again
          looked down at the manuscript.
         </p> 
         <p><said>Does that engross your attention so
         entirely, my dear,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         <said>that you can neither spare one word nor
         one loo for your mother?</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>O mamma! I only tried to read
         because I thought you were angry with
         me.</said>             
         </p> 
         <p><said>An odd reason for trying to read,
         my dear!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> with a
         smile; <said>have you any better reason for
         thinking I was angry with you?</said>             
         </p> 
         <p><said>Ah, I know you are not angry now,
         for you smile,</said> said <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>; <said>but I
         thought at first that you were, mamma,
         because you gave me only your hand to
         kiss.</said>             
         </p> 
          <p><said>Only my hand—The next time, simpleton!
          I'll give you only my foot to kiss,</said>
          said <rs ref="#ld" type="person">her ladyship</rs>, sitting down and holding
          out her foot playfully.
          </p>
         <p><rs type="person" ref="#hd">Her daughter</rs> threw aside the book,
         and kneeling down kissed her foot, saying,
         in a low voice, <said>Dear mamma, I never
         was so happy in my life; for you never
         
         
         
         looked so very, <emph>very</emph> kindly at me before.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Do not judge always of the kindness
         people feel for you, child, by their looks;
         and remember that it is <emph>possible</emph> a person
         might have felt more than you could guess
         by their looks. Pray now, <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, you</said>
         who are such a good judge of physiognomy,
         should you guess that I was dying
         by my looks?
         </p> 
         <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#hd">little girl</rs> laughed, and repeated
         <said><emph>Dying</emph>?—O no, mamma.</said>
         </p>       
          <p><said>O no! because I have such a fine
          colour in my cheeks—Hey?</said>              
          </p>  
          <p><said>Not for that reason, mamma,</said> said
          <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, withdrawing her eyes from <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her
          mother's</rs> face.
          </p>  
          <p><said>What, then you know roughe already
          when you see it?—You perceive some difference,
          for instance, between <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> 
          colour and mine? Upon my word,
          you are a nice observer. Such nice observers
          are some times dangerous to have
          near one.</said>              
          </p>
          <p><said>I hope, mother,</said> said <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, <said>that
          you do not think I would try to find
          out any thing thaty ou wish, or that
          
          
          
          
          I imagined you wished, I should not
          know?</said>              
          </p>  
          <p><said>I do not understand you, child,</said>
          cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, raising herself suddenly
           upon the sofa, and looking full in
           <rs type="person" ref="#hd">her daughter's</rs> face.
          </p>  
          <p><persName ref="#hd">Helena's</persName> colour rose to her temples;
           but, with a firmness that surprised even
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, she repeated what she had said
           nearly in the same words.
          </p>
          <p><said>Do you understand her, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?</said>
           said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.
          </p>  
         <p><said>She expresses, I think,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
          <said>a very honourable sentiment, and one
          that is easily understood.</said>
         </p>
         <p><said>Ay, in general, certainly,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady 
         Delacour</persName>, checking herself; <said>but I
         thought that she meant to allude to something
         in particular—<emph>that</emph> was what I did 
         not understand. Undoubtedly my dear,
         you have just expressed a very honourable
         sentiment, and one that I should scarcely
         have expected from a child your age.</said>
             
         </p>
