                        with prudence and integrity. Her character,

                                   and consequently the most ridiculous manner,

                                   tittering, and flirting; full of the present
                                   moment, never reflecting upon the future;

                                   grows tired of them? If they have large

                                   to divert themselves for a season or two
                                   without doubt; they are sure to be sought

                                   in your education, and (which is the essential
                                   point) I have taken care that this

                                   You will always have the name of being very

                                   <emph>indisputable</emph>. I need say no more to you
                                   upon this subject, my dear. Even with
                                   your limited experience, you must have
                                   observed how foolish young people offend
                                   those who are the most necessary to their
                                   interests, by an imprudent indulgence of
                                   their vanity.

                 <p>It is sometimes fortunate, that the means,
                     which are taken to produce cerrtain effects
                     upon the mind, have a tendency directly
                     opposite to what is expected. <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
                     perpetual anxiety about her niece's
                     appearance, manners, and establishment,
                     had completely worn out <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> patience;
                     she had become more insensible to
                     the praises of her personal charms and accomplishments,
                     than young women of her
                     age usually are, because she had been so
                     much flattered and <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">shown off</distinct>, as it is called,
                     by her match-making aunt. Yet <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                     was fond of amusement, and had 
                     imbibed some of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> preju-

                     <fw type="pageNum">8</fw>
                     dices in favour of rank and fashion. Her
                     taste for literature declined in proportion
                     to her intercourse with the fashionable
                     world, as she did not in this society, perceive
                     the least use in the knowledge that 
                     she had acquired. Her mind had never 
                     been roused to much reflection; she had
                     in general acted but as a puppet in the
                     hands of others. To her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_00001">aunt Stanhope</persName>
                     she had hitherto paid unlimited, habitual,
                     blind obedience; but she was more free from affectation
                     and coquetry, than could have been expected,
                     after the course of documenting,
                     which she had gone through. She was 
                     charmed with the idea of her visit to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour</persName>, whom she thought the most
                     agreeable—no, that is too feeble an expression—
                     the most fascinating person she
                     had ever beheld. Such was the light in 
                     which her ladyship appeared, not only to
                     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but to all the world—that is to
                     say, all the world of fashion, and she knew
                     of no other.—The newspapers were full 
                     of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> parties, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
                     dresses, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> bon
                     mots: every thing, that her ladyship said,
                     was repeated as witty: every thing, that
                     <pb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum">9</fw>
                     her ladyship wore, was imitated as fashionable.
                     Female wit sometimes depends on
                     the beauty of it's possessor, for it's reputation;
                     and the reign of beauty is proverbially
                     short, and fashion often capriciously
                     deserts her favourites, even before nature
                     withers their charms. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
                     seemed to be the fortunate exception to
                     these general rules: long after she had
                     lost the bloom of youth, she continued to
                     be admired as a fashionable <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</foreign>; and
                     long after she had ceased to be a novelty
                     in society, her company was courted by 
                     all the gay, the witty, and the gallant.
                     To be seen in public with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
                     to be a visitor at her house, were privileges,
                     of which numbers were vehemently
                     ambitious; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> was congratulated
                     and envied by all her acquaintance, for being admitted as an inmate.
                     Howe could she avoid thinking herself singularly 
                     fortunate?
                 </p>
                 <p>A short time after her arrival at <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

                     the thin veil, with which politeness covers
                     domestic misery.—Abroad, and at home,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was two different persons.
                     Abroad she appeared all life, spirit, and 
                     <pb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum">10</fw>
                     good humour—at home, listless, fretful,
                     and melancholy; she seemed like a spoiled
                     actress off the stage, over stiumlated
                     by applause, and exhausted by the exertions
                     of supporting a fictitious character.
                     —When her house was filled with well-
                     dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights,
                     and resounded with music and dancing,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in the character of the
                     mistres of the revels, shone the soul and
                     spirit of pleasure and frolic—But the moment
                     the company retired, when the
                     music ceased, and the lights were extinguishing,
                     the spell was dissolved.                     
                 </p>
                 <p>She would sometimes walk up and down 
                     the empty magnificent saloon, absorbed in
                     thoughts seemingly of the most painful 
                     nature.

                        he imagined, that, as such, he was entitled
                        to be imprudent, wild, and eccentric. He
                        affected singularity, in order to establish
                        his claim to genius. He had considerable 
                        literary talents, by which he weas distinguished
                        at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>; but he was so
                        dreadfully afraid of passing for a pedant,
                        that when he came into the company of
                        the idle and the ignorant, he pretended to
                        disdain every species of knowledge. His
                        <ecda:fauna>cameleon</ecda:fauna> character seemed to vary in different
                        lights, and according to the different 
                        situations, in which he happened to
                        be placed. He could be all things to all
                        men—and to all women—He was supposed
                        to be a favourite with the fair sex;
                        and of all his various excellences and defects,
                        there were none, on which he valued
                        himself so much as his gallantry. he
                        was not profligate; he had a strong sense
                        <pb/>
                        <fw type="pageNum">18</fw>
                        of honour, and quick feelings of humanity;
                        but he was so easily led, or rather
                        so easily excited by his companions, and
                        his companions were now of such a sort,
                        that it was probable he would soon become
                        vicious. As to his connexion with <persName ref="#ld">lady
                        Delacour</persName>, he would have started with
                        horror at the idea of disturbing the peace
                        of a family; but in her family, he said,
                        there was not peace to disturb: he was
                        vain of having it seen by the world, that
                        he was distinguished by a lady of her wit
                        and fashion, and he did not think it incumbent 
                        on him to be more scrupulous or
                        more attentive to appearance, than her
                        ladyship. By <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> jealousy
                        he was sometimes provoked, sometimes 
                        amused, and sometimes flattered. He was
                        constantly of all her ladyship's parties, in
                        public and private; consequently he saw
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> almost every day, and every day
                        he saw her with increasing admiration of
                        her beauty, and with increasing dread of
                        being taken in, to marry a niece of <quote rend="quotes">the

                        to be partners in all the speculations,
                        though their names may not appear in the
                        firm. If he had not been prejudiced by
                        the character of her aunt, <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
                        would have thought <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> an undesigning
                        unaffected girl; but now he suspected
                        her of artifice in every word, look, and
                        motion; and even when he felt himself
                        most charmed by her powers of pleasing,
                        he was most inclined to despise her, 
                        for what he thought such premature
                        proficiency in scientific coquetry. He
                        had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond
                        the sphere of her attraction; but
                        frequently, when he found himself within
                        it, he cursed his folly, and drew back
                        with sudden terrour. His manner towards
                        her was so variable and inconsistent, that
                        she knew not how to interpret it's language.
                        Sometimes she fancied, that with
                        all the eloquence of eyes he said, <said><emph>I
                       adore you</emph>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>;</said> at other times she
                        imagined, that his guarded silence meant
                        to warn her, that he was so entangled by
                        <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, that he could not extricate
                        himself from her snares. Whenever
                        this last idea struck her, it excited, in the
                        most edifying manner, her indignation 
                        against coquetry in general, and against
                        <pb/>

                        her ladyship's in particular: she became
                        wonderfully clear-sighted to all the improprieties
                        of her ladyship's conduct. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                        newly acquired moral sense was so 
                        much shocked, that she actually wrote
                        a full statement of her observations, and 
                        her scruples to her<persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>, concluding 
                        by a request, that she might not
                        remain under the protection of a lady,
                        whose character she could not approve,
                        and whose intimacy might prehaps be
                        injurious to her reputation, if not to her 
                        principles.

                        in a very guarded style; she rebuked
                        her niece very seveely for her imprudence in
                        mentioning <emph>names</emph> in such a manner, in a
                        letter sent by the common post; assured
                        her that her reputation was in no danger;
                        that she hoped no niece of hers would set
                        up for a prude; a character more suspected
                        by men of the world, than even
                        that of a coquette; that the <rs type="person" ref="#ld">person</rs> alluded 
                        to was a perfectly fit chaperon for
                        any young lady to appear with in public,
                        as long as she was visited by the first
                        people in town; that as to any thing in

                        and her lord, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> should observe,
                        on these dangerous topics, a profound silence,
                        both in her letters and her conversation;
                        tht as long as the lady continued under
                        the protection of <rs type="person" ref="#md">her husband</rs>, the world
                        might whisper, but would not speak out;
                        that as to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> own principles,
                        she would be utterly inexcusable, if, after 
                        the education she had received, they
                        could be hurt by any bad examples; that
                        she could not be too cautious in her management 
                        of a man of <rs ref="#ch" type="person">―'s</rs> character;
                        that she could have no <emph>serious</emph> cause
                        for jealousy in the quarter she apprehended,
                        as marriage there could not be 
                        the object; and there was such a difference
                        of age, that no permanent influence
                        could probably be oobtained by the lady;
                        that the most certain method for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
                        Portman</persName> to expose herself to the ridicule 
                        of one of the parties, and to the total
                        neglect of the other, would be to betray
                        anxiety or jealousy: that, in short, if she
                        were fool enough to lose her own heart,
                        there would be little chance of her being

                        was evidently a man of gallantry rather

                    <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> fears of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, as a

                        the artful insinuations of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
                        with respect to her age, &amp;c. and in proportion
                        as her fears subsided, she blamed
                        herself for having written too harshly
                        of her ladyship's conduct. The idea that

                        friend, she ought not to propogate any

                        thought that she had been guilty of treachery,
                        and she wrote again immediately to

          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> opened her dressing-

           extremely out of humour at having been 
           kept waiting so long; and yet more so at
           the idea that her apellant jurisdiction

       <p><said>Stay, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,

           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>?—O yes, you must be the comic
           muse; and I, it seems, must be tragedy,
           because <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> has a passion for seeing

           my dear—so tragedy I needs must be—

       </p>
       <p>There was an air of extreme vexation
           in <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> countenance, as she
           pronounced these last words, in which evidently
           more was meant than meat the ear.
           Upon many occasions <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> had
           observed, that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> exercised despotic
           authority over her mistress; and she had
           seen, with surprise, that a lady, who would
           not yield an iota of power to her <rs ref="#md" type="person">her husband</rs>,
           submitted herself to every caprice of the
           most insolent of waiting-women. For some
           time <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> imagined that this submission
           was merely an air, as she had seen
           <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">some other fine ladies</ecda:persGroup> proud of appearing
           to be goverened by a favourite maid; but 
           she was soon convinced that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
           was in possession of some secret, which
           should for ever remain unknown. This
           idea had occurred to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> more
           than once; but never so forcibly as upon
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">30</fw>
           the present occasion. There had always
           been some mystery about her ladyship's
           toilette; at certain hours doors were bolted,
           and it was impossible for any body but
           <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to obtain admission. <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>
           at first imagined that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           dreaded the discovery of her cosmetic secrets,
           but her ladyship's rogue was so glaring,
           and her pearl powder was so obvious,
           that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was convinced there must be
           some other cause for this toilette secresy.
           There was a little cabinet beyond her bedchamber,
           which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> called her
           boudoir, to which there was an entrance by
           a back stair-case; but no one ever entered
           there but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>. One night, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, 
           after dancing with great spirit at a
           ball, at her own house, fainted suddenly:
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> attended her to her bed-
           chamber, but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> begged that her lady
           might be left alone with <emph>her</emph>, and she would
           by no means <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> to follow her
           into the boudoir.—All these things <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
           recollected in the space of a few seconds
           as she stood contemplating <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> and
           the dresses. The hurry of getting ready
           for the masquerade, however, dispelled
           these thoughts, and by the time she was
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">31</fw>
           dressed, the idea of what <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           would think of her appearance was uppermost
           in her mind. She was anxious to
           know, whether he would discover her in
           the character of the comic muse. <persName ref="#ld">Lady
           Delacour</persName> was discontented with her tragic
           attire, and she grew still moure out of humour
           with herself, when she saw <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.           
       </p> 
       <p><said>I protest <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> has made a perfect
       fight of me,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, as she
       got into her carriage, <said>and I'm positive
       my dress would become you a million of
       times better than your own.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> regretted that it was too
       late to change.</p>
        <p><said>Not at all too late, my dear,</said> said
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>; <said>never too late for women
         to change their minds, their dress, or their
         lovers. Seriously, you know, we are to
         call at my friend <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>—she sees
         masks too night—I'm quite intimate there;
         I'll make her let me ste up to her own 
         room, where no soul can interrupt us, and
         there we can change our dresses, and <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
         will know nothing of the matter.
         <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName> a faithful creature; and very
         fond of me; fond of power too—but who
         is not?—we must all hae our faults—one
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">32</fw>
         would not quarrel with such a good creature
         as <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> for a trifle.</said> Then suddenly
         changing her tone, she said <said>not a
         human being will find us out at the masquerade;
         for no one but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs Freke</persName> knows 
         that we are two muses. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> 
         swears he should know me in any disguise
         —but I defy him—I shall take special delight
         in puzzling him. <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> has
         told him, in confidence, that I'm to be the
         <persName ref="#widow_brady_0001">widow Brady</persName>, in man's clothes; now that's 
         to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> own character, so <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>
         will make fine confusion.</said>            
        </p>   
        <p>As soon as they got to <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> immediately
            went up stairs to exchange dresses.
            Poor <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, now she felt herself in
            spirits to undertake the comic muse, was
            rather vexed to be obliged to give up her
            becoming character; but there was no resisting 
            the polite energy of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> 
            vanity. Her ladyship ran as quick as
            lightning into a closet within the dressing-
            room, saying to <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName> woman</ecda:anonPers>,
            who attempted to follow with—<said>Can I do
            any thing for your ladyship?</said>—<said>No, No,
            no—nothing, nothing—thank ye, thank
            ye,—I want no assistance—I never let any
                <pb/>
                <fw type="pageNum">33</fw>
            body do any thing for me but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>;</said>
            and she bolted herself in the closet. In a
            few minutes she half opened the door,
            threw out her tragic robes, and cried,
            <said>Here, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, give me yours—
            quick—and let's see whether comedy or
            tragedy will be ready first.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Lord bless and forgive me,</said> said <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>
        woman</ecda:anonPers>, when <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
        at last threw open the door, when she was
        completely dressed—<said>but, if your la'ship
        has not been dressing all this time in that
        den, without any thing in the shape of a
        looking glass—and not to let me help! I
        that should have been so proud.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> put <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">half a guinea</ecda:commodity> into
            the <ecda:anonPers>waiting-maid's</ecda:anonPers> hand, laughed affectedly
            at her own <emph>whimsicalities</emph>, and declared,
            that she could always dress herself
            better without a glass than with one. All
            this went off admirably well with every
            body but <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>; she could not
            help thinking it extraordinary, that a person
            who was obviously fond of being waited 
            upon, would never suffer any person to
            assist her at her toilette except <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, a
            woman of whom she was evidently afraid.
            <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> quick eye saw curiosity
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">34</fw>
            painted in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> countenance, and for
            a moment she was embarrassed; but she
            soon recovered herself, and endeavoured to
            turn the course of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> thoughts,
            by whispering to her some nonsense about
            <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>—A cabalistical name,
            which she knew had the power, when
            pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> into confusion.            
        </p>
        <p>The first person they saw, when they
            went into the drawing-room at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            was this very <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who
            was not in a domino. He had laid a wager
            with <ecda:anonPers>one of his acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, that he could
            perform the part of the <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, such as
            he is seen in <persName ref="#henry_fuseli_1741">Fuseli's</persName> well known picture.
            For this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity
            in the invention and execution of
            a length of coiled skin, which he manœuvred
            with great dexterity, by means of internal
            wires; his grand difficulty had been
            to manufacture the rays that were to come
            from his eyes. He had contrived a set of
            phosphoric rays, which he was certain 
            would charm all the fair <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">daughters of <persName ref="#eve_0001">Eve</persName></ecda:persGroup>.
            He forgot, it seems, that phosphorus could
            not well be seen by candle light. When
            he was just equipped as a <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, his rays
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">35</fw>
            set fire to part of his <mcr rend="italic">italic</mcr>, and it was
            with the greatest difficulty that he was
            extricated. He escaped unhurt, but his
            <ecda:fauna>serpent's</ecda:fauna> skin was utterly consumed; nothing
            remained, but the melancholy spectacle
            of it's skeleton. He was obliged to
            give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade,
            but he resolved to be at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            that he might meet <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and
            <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. The moment that
            the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">tragic and comic muse</ecda:persGroup> appeared, he 
            invoked them with much humour and 
            mock pathos, declaring that he knew not
            which of them could best sing his adventure.
            After a recital of his misfortune
            had entertained the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">company</ecda:persGroup>, and after
            the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">muses</ecda:persGroup> had performed their parts to the
            satisfaction of the audience, and their own,
            the conversation ceased to be supported in
            masquerade character; <ecda:persGroup>muses and harlequins,
            gipsies and <name>Cleopatras</name></ecda:persGroup>, began to talk
            of their private acfairs, and of the news
            and the scandal of the day. 
        </p>
        <p>A <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">group of gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>, amongst whom 
            was <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, gathered round the
            tragic muse; as <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> had hinted
            that he knew she was a person of distinction,
            though he would not tell her name.
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">36</fw>
            He thought that he could not flatter her 
            ladyship more than by abusing <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
            After he had exercised his wit for 
            some time, without obtaining from the
            tragic muse one single syllable, he whispered,
            <said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, why this unnatural
            reserve? do you imagine, that, 
            through this tragical disguise, I have not
            found you out?</said>
        </p>
        <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#bp">tragic muse</rs>, apparently absorbed

        </p>
        <p><said>The devil a word can you get for your

        instant. <said>Why didn't you stick to t'<rs ref="#ld" type="person">other
        muse</rs>, who, to do her justice, is as errant
        a flirt as your heart could wish for.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>There's danger in flirting,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
            <said>with an errant flirt of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
            training. There's a kind of electricity
            about that <rs type="person" ref="#bp">girl</rs>. I have a sort of

            all over me.</said>            
        </p>  
        <p><said>Fore-warned is fore-armed,</said> replied
            <ecda:anonPers>his companion</ecda:anonPers>—<said>a man must be a novice

         —<said>There's no less than <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">six of her nieces</ecda:persGroup>, 
         whom she has <emph>got off</emph> within these four
         winters—Not a one of 'em now, that has
         not made a catch-match—There's the
         eldes of the set, <persName ref="#tollemache_0001">Mrs. Tollemache</persName>, what
         had she, in the devil's name, to set up 
         with in the world, but a pair of good eyes
         —Her aut, to be sure, taught her the
         use of them early enough—They might
         have rolled to all eternity, before they
         would have rolled me out of my senses;
         but you see, they did <persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache's</persName> business
         —However they are going to part
         now, I hear—<persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache</persName> was tired of her,
         before the honey-moon was over, as I
         foretold. Then there's the musical girl—
         <persName ref="#joddrell_0001">Joddrell</persName>, who has no more ear than a
         post, went and married her, because he
         had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in

         that he was one.</said>   
        </p>  
        <p>The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> joined in the general
            laugh—The <rs type="person" ref="#bp">tragic muse</rs> sighed—
        </p>     
        <p><said>Even were she at the <title ref="#sheridan_school">School for Scandal</title>,

             <fw type="pageNum">38</fw>
        <p><said>Far be it from her, to laugh at those

        said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, in a feigned voice—<said>What
        miseries spring from these ill-suited marriages!
        —The victims are sacrificed, before

        </p>
        <p><said>Yes: she was a mighty fine dancer,

            got poor <persName ref="#valleton_0001">Valleton</persName> to fight a duel
            about her place in a country dance, and
            then he was so pleased with himself for

         <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> made an effort to change her

         she had neither eyes, nose, mouth, nor legs:
         what <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> could do with her I
         often wondered; but she took courage,

         and she dashed herself into <persName ref="#tom_levit_0001">Tom Levit's</persName>

         own hands, and I hear, she's driving him
         and herself <emph>the road to ruin</emph>, as fast as
         they can gallop. As for this <persName ref="#bp">Belinda
         Portman</persName> 'twas a good hit to send her

          Her ladyship, though she would sacrifice

          to her vanity, whenever the power of

        —Or are they tears? for by the light of

        —What is the meanining of all this? You'd

        <p>To <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> the night appeared long
            and dull; the common place wit of <ecda:persGroup>chimney-

            <ecda:persGroup>harlequins</ecda:persGroup>; the graces of <ecda:persGroup>flower-girls</ecda:persGroup> and
            <ecda:persGroup><name>Cleopatras</name></ecda:persGroup> had not power to amuse her;
            for her thoughts still recurred to that conversation

        <p><said>Amazing you might well say, if you

         heaved a deep sigh, threw herself back
         in the carriage, let fall her mask, and was 
         silent—It was broad day-light, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         had a full view of her countenance,
         which was the picture of despair—She
         uttered not one syllable more, nor had
         <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> the courage to interrupt her
         meditations, till they came within sight
         of <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>; when <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> ventured
         to remind her, that she had resolved
         to stop there, and change dresses before

         Her ladyship sunk back into her former
         attitude; but after she had remained silent
         for some moments, she started up and 
         exclaimed—

        </p>   
        <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> astonishment at these words,
         and at the solemn manner in which they
         were pronounced, was inexpressible; she

        said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, in an emphatic tone.
        </p>
        <p>Not a word more passed, till they got

         bidding <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> follow her to her dressing-
         room. <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> was lighting the six
         wax candles on the dressing-table—<said>As I

         said <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to herself, as she fixed her

         <said>I'll be burnt, if I don't make my

        and taking one of the candles from 
        the table, she pressed on hastily with
        <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, through her dressing-room,
        through her bedchamber, and to the door
        of the mysterious cabinet.           
       </p>  
      <p><said><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, the key of this door,</said> cried
        she, impatiently, after she had, in vain,

       </p>      
       <p><said>Heavenly graciousness!</said>, cried <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,
       <said>is my lady out of her senses?</said>
       </p>   
        <p><said>The key—the key—quick, the key,</said>
         repeated <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, in a peremptory
         tone, she seized it as soon as <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">52</fw>
          drew it from her pocket, and unlocked the

        <p><said>Had I not best put <emph>the things</emph> to
        rights, my lady?</said> said <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, catching
         fast hold of the opening door.            
        </p>     
        <p><said>I'll ring when you are wanted, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said>
         said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>; and pushing
         open the door with violence, she rushed
         forward to the middle of the room, and
         turning back she beckoned to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> to
         follow her—<said>Come in, what is it you are
         afraid of?</said> said she.—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> went on,
         and the moment she was in the room,
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> shut and locked the door.
          The room was rather dark, as there was no 
          light in it, except what came from the
          candle, which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> held in her
          hand, and which burned but dimly.—
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, as she looked round, saw nothing
          but a confusion of linen rags—vials, some 
          empty, some full, and she perceived that
          there was a strong smell of medicines.
        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, whose motions were all
        precipitate, like those of a person whose
        mind is in great agitation, looked from 
        side to side of the room, without seeming
        to know what she was in search of. She 
        then, with a species of fury, wiped the
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">53</fw>
        paint from her face, and returning to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
        held the candle so as to throw the
        light full upon her livid features. Her
        eyes were sunk, her cheeks hollow—no
        trace of youth or beauty remained on her
        death-like countenance, which formed a
        horrid contrast with her gay fantastic dress.
        </p>     
       <p><said>You are shocked, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,</said>, said she,
         <said>but as yet you have seen nothing—look
         here,—</said> and baring one half of her bosom,
         she revealed a hideous spectacle.           
       </p>      
       <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> sunk back into a chair—<persName ref="#ld">lady

       her.          
       </p>      
        <p><said>Am I humbled, am I wretched enough?</said>
         cried she, her voice trembling with agony
         —<said>Yes, pity me, for what you have seen;
         and a thousand times more—my mind is eaten away
         like my body, by incurable disease—inveterate
         remores—remorse for a life of folly
         —of folly which has brought on me all
         the punishments of guilt.</said>
        </p>     
        <p><said><rs ref="#md" type="person">My husband</rs>,</said> continued she, and
          her voice suddenly altered from the tone
          of grief to that of anger—<said>My husaband

              <fw type="pageNum">54</fw>
          them—<ecda:persGroup>My own relations</ecda:persGroup> hate me—no

          never shall they see my sorrow—never
          shall they hear a complaint, a sigh from
          me. There is no torture which I could
          not more easily endure than their insulting
          pity. I will die, as I have lived, the envy
          and admiration of the world. When I
          am gone, let them find out their mistake;
          and moralise, if they wil, over my grave.</said>
          —She paused—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had no power to
           speak.
        </p>     
        <p><said>Promise, swear to me,</said> resumed <persName ref="#ld">lady

        hand, <said>that you will never reveal to any

        to whom I trusted every secret of my life,
        every thought of my hear.—Fool! idiot!
        Dupe that I was to trust to the friendship
        of a woman, whom I knew to be without 
        principle—but I thought she had honour;

        you who I thought would have supported

        would receive my last breath—you to desert
        me!—Now I am alone in the world—
        left to the mercy of an insolent waiting-

        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> hid her face on <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
          lap, and almost stifled by the violence of
          contending emotions, she at last gave vent
          to them, and sobbed aloud.
        </p>     
        <p><said>Trust to one,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, pressing
            her hand with all the tenderness which

            leave you at the mercy of an insolent waiting
            woman—trust to me.</said>            
        </p>     
        <p><said>Trust to you,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
            looking up eagerly in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> face;

            symptoms of artless feeling about you.
            This was what tempted me to open my
            mind to you, when I found that I had lost
            the only friend—but I will think no more 
            of that—if you have a heart, you must

            <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> appeared with a face of constrained

        <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, when she was left alone, immediately
            opened her shutters, and threw
            up the sash to refresh herself with the
            morning air. She felt excessively fatigued,
            and in the hurry of her mind, she could
            not think of any thing distinctly. She 
            took off her masquerade dress, and went
            to bed, in hopes of forgetting, for a few
            hours, what she felt indelibly impressed
            upon her imagination. But it was in vain
            that she endeavoured to compose herself
            to sleep; her ideas were in too great and
            painful confusion. For some time, whenever
            she closed her eyes, the face and form
            of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, such as she had just
            beheld them, seemed to haunt her; afterwards, 
            the idea of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and
            the painful recollection of the conversation
            she had overheard, recurred to her; the
            words, <said><quote>do you think I don't know that

            fice and affectation</quote>,</said> were fixed in her 
            memory. She recollected with the utmost 
            minuteness every look of contempt, which
            she had seen in the faces of the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">young
            men</ecda:persGroup>, whilst they spoke of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
            the match-maker. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mind, however,
            was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect:
            she seemed only to live over again
            the preceding night. At last the strange
            motley figures whish she had seen at the
            masquerade flitted before her eyes, and she
            sunk into an uneasy slumber.

             <fw type="pageNum">62</fw>
             woman who is known to play the fool, is
             always suspected of playing the devil—
             But I begin wehre I ought to end, with 
             my moral, which I dare say you are not
             impatient to anticipate—I never read or
             listened to a moral at the end of a story in
             my life—manners for me, and morals for
             those that like them.—My dear, you will
             be wofully disappointed, if in my story
             you expect any thing like a novel. I once
             heard a general say, that nothing was less
             like a review than a battle; and I can tell
             you, that nothing is more unlike a novel
             than real life. Of all lives, mine has been
             the least romantic. No love in it, but a
             great deal of hate. I was a rich heiress—I
             had, I believe, a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">hundred thousand pounds,
             or more</ecda:commodity>; and twice as many caprices—I
             was handsome and witty—or, to speak
             with that kind of circumlocution which
             is called humility, the world, the partial
             world, thought me a beauty, and a bel-
             esprit.—Having told you my fortune, need
             I add, that I, or it, had <rs type="persGroup">lovers</rs> in abundance
             —of all sorts and degrees—not to reckon
             those, it may be presumed, who died of
             concealed passions for me. I had sixteen
             declarations and proposals in form—then
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">63</fw>
             what in the name of wonder, or of common
             sense, which by the by is the greatest 
             of wonders—what in the name of common 
             sense made me marry <persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour</persName>?—
             Why, my dear, you,—no not <emph>you</emph>, but any
             girl who is not used to have a parcel of
             admirers, would think it the easiest thing
             in the world to make her choice; but let
             her judge by what she feels when a dexterous
             mercer or linen-draper produces pretty
             thing after pretty thing—and this is so
             becoming, and that will wear for ever—
             as he swears; but then that's so fashionable
             —the novice stands in a charming perplexity,
             and after examining, and doubting,
             and tossing over half the <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">goods</ecda:commodity> in the

             the young lady, in a hurry, pitches
             upon the very ugliest and worst thing that
             she has seen. Just so it was with me and

             I thought I should in time break him in.
             —From the specimens you have seen, you

             —I had almost gained my point, just

             <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, that he knew no more how

             who is conceit personified, took mortal

             always at hand to turn anger into malice,
             put it into <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort's</persName> head, to put it
             into my lord's head, that the world thought
             —<quote rend="italic"><said direct="false">My lady governed him</said></quote>. My lord
             took fire—They say the <ecda:fauna>torpedo</ecda:fauna>, the 
             coldest of cold creatures, sometimes gives
             out a spark—I suppose, when electrified
             with anger.—The next time that innocent
             I insisted upon my <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> doing
             or not doing—I forget which—the most
             reasonable thing in the world, my lord
             turns short round, and answers—<said>My
             <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, I am not a man to be governed
             by a wife</said>—And from that time 
             to this, the words <quote>I am not a man to be 
             governed by a wife</quote>—have been written
             in his obstinate face, as all the world who

              <fw type="pageNum">67</fw>
             can read the human countenance may 
             see.—My dear I laugh, but even in the
             midst of laughter there is sadness.—But
             you don't know what it is—I hope you
             never may—to have an obstinate fool for
             a bosom fiend.</p>
             <p>I at first flattered myself, that <rs type="person" ref="#md">my
             lord's</rs> was not an inveterate, incurable malady:
             but from his obvious weakness, I
             might have seen that there was no hope;
             for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous
             in proportion to the weakness of the
             patient.—My lord's case was desperate.—
             Kill or cure, was my humane or prudent
             maxim.—I determined to try the <seg ana="#poison">poison 
             of jealousy</seg>, by way of an alternative.—I 
             had long kept it in petto as my ultimate 
             remedy. I fixed upon a proper subject—
             a man with whom I thought that I could
             coquette to all eternity, without any danger
             to myself—a certain <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>—
             as empty a coxcomb as you would wish to
             see.—The world, said I to myself, can
             never be so absurd to suspect <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
             with such a man as this, though
             her lord may, and will, for nothing is too 
             absured for him to believe.—Half my theory
             proved just—that is saying a great deal
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">68</fw>
             for any theory. My lord swallowed the 
             remedy that I had prepared for him, with
             an avidity, and a bonhommie, which it did
             me good to behold—my remedy operated
             beyond my most sanguine expectations.—
             The poor man was cured of his obstinacy,
             and became stark mad with jealousy.—
             THen indeed I had some hopes of him;
             for a madman can be managed, a fool cannot.
             In a month's time, I made him
             quite docile. With a face longer than the
             <rs type="person" ref="#heraclitus_535">weeping philosopher's</rs>, he came to me one
             morning, and assured me, <said direct="false">he would do
             every thing I pleased, provided I would
             consult my own honour, and his, and give
             up <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>.</said></p>   
             <p><quote><said>Give up!</said></quote>—I could hardly forbear
             laughing at the expression.—I replied,
             <said direct="false">that as long as my lord treated me with
             becoming respect, I had never in thought
             or deed given him just cause of complaint;
             but that I was not a woman to be insulted,
             or to be kept, as I had hither to been, in 
             leading-strings, by a husband.</said> My lord,                 
             flattered, as I meant he should be with the
             idea, that it was possible he should be

             strings, fell to making protestations—<said direct="false">he
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">69</fw>
             hoped his future conduct would prove, &amp;c.</said>
             —Upon this hint, I gave the reins to my
             imagination, and full drive I went into a
             fresh career of extravagance; if I were
             checked, it was <quote rend="italic">an insult</quote>, and I began directly
             to talk of <quote rend="italic">leading-strings</quote>. This riduculous
             game I played successfully enough,
             for some time, till at length, though naturally
             rather slow at calculations, he actually
             discovered that if we lived at the rate of
             <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty thousand</measure> a year, and had only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten 
             thousand</measure> a year to spend, we should, in
             due time, have nothing left. This notable
             discovery he communicated to me one
             morning, after a long preamble. When
             he had finished prosing, I agreed, that it 
             was demonstrably just, that he should retrench
             his expenses; but that it was equally
             unjust and impossible, that I could make
             any reformation in my civil list.—That 
             <distinct type="mentioned">economy</distinct> was a word which I had never
             heard of in my life, till I married his lordsip:
             that, upon second recollection, it 
             was true, I had heard of such a thing as 
             national economy; and that it would be 
             a very pretty, though rather hackneyed
             topic of declamation for a maiden speech
             in the <orgName>house of lords</orgName>. I therefore advised
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">70</fw>
             him to reserve all he had to say upon this
             subject for the noble <ecda:anonPers>lord upon the wool-
             sack</ecda:anonPers>; nay, I very graciously added, that
             upon this condition, I would go to the
             house myself to give his arguments and
             eloquence a fair hearing, and that I would
             do my best to keep myself away.—This
             was all mighty playful and witty; but it 
             happened that my <persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour</persName>, who never
             had any great taste for wit, could not this
             unluckily morning at all relish it. Of course
             I grew angry, and reminded him, with an
             indelicacy which his want of generosity
             justified, that an heiress, who had brought
             a hundred thousand pounds into his family,
             had some right to amuse herself, and that
             it was not my fault if elegant amusements
             were more expensive than others.</p>
             <p>Then came a long criminating and recriminating
            chapter. It was, <said direct="false">My lord,
            your <rs type="properAdjective">Newmarket</rs> blunders.</said>—<said direct="false">My lady,
            your cursed <emph>theatricals</emph></said>—<said direct="false">My lord, I have
            surely a right</said>—<said direct="false">and my lady, I have
            surely as good a right.</said>                 
             </p>
          <p>But, my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, however we
              might pay one another, we could not pay
              all the world with words. In short, after
              running through <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">thousands, and tens of 
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">71</fw>
              thousands</ecda:commodity>, we were actually in distress
              for <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>. Then  came selling of lands
              and I don't know what devices, for raising
              <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, according to the mode of <rs type="persGroup">lawyers
              and attorneys</rs>. It was quite indifferent to 
              me how they got <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, provided they
              did get it.—By what art these <rs type="persGroup">gentlemen</rs>
              raised <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, I never troubled myself to
              inquire; it might have been the black art,
              for any thing I know to the contrary. So I signed
              all the papers they brought to me; and I
              was mighty well pleased to find, that by so
              easy an expidient as writing <quote rend="quotes"><persName ref="#ld">T. C. H. 
              Delacour</persName></quote>, I could command money at
              will.—I signed, and signed, till at last I 
              was with all due civility informed that my
              signature was no longer worth a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">farthing</ecda:commodity>;
              and when I came to inquire into the cause
              of this phenomenon, I could no wise understand
              what my <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour's</persName> lawyer</ecda:anonPers>
              said to me. He was a prig, and I had 
              not patience either to listen to him, or to
              look at him. I sent for an <ecda:anonPers>old uncle</ecda:anonPers> of
              mine, who used to manage all my <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>
              matters before I was married: I put the
              <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> and the <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> into a room together
              with their parchments, to fight the matter
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">72</fw>
              out, or to come to a right understanding
              if they could.—The last it seems was quite
              impossible.—In the course of half an hour,
              out comes my <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> in such a rage! I
              never shall forget his face—all the bile in
              his body had gotten into it—he had literally 
              no whites to his eyes. <said>My dear
              uncle,</said> said I, <said>What is the matter?—
              Why you are absolutely gold stick in
              waiting.</said>             
          </p>
          <p><said>No matter what I am, child,</said> said the
            <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers>, <said>I'll tell you what you are with all 
            your wit—a dupe—'tis a shame for a woman
            of your sense to be such a fool, and
            to know nothing of business—and if you
            knew nothing yourself, could you not send
            for me?</said>              
          </p>
         <p><said>I was too ignorant to know that I 
         knew nothing,</said> said I; <choice><sic></sic><corr/></choice>but I will not
         trouble you with all the said Is and said
         hes. I was made to understand, that if 
         <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> were to die the next day, I
         should live a beggar.—Upon this I grew
         serious, as you may imagine. My <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers>
         assured me that I had been grossly imposed
         upon by my lord and his <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> ,
         and that I had been swindled out of my 
         senses, and out of my dower. I repeated
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">73</fw>
         all that my <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> said, very faithfully, to
         <persName ref="md">lord Delacour</persName>: and all that either he or
         his <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> could furnish out by way of
         answer was, that <quote><said direct="false">necessity had no law</said></quote>.
         Necessity, it must be allowed, though it
         might be the mother of law, was never
         with my lord the mother of invention.
         Having now found out that I had a good
         right to complain, I indulged myself in
         it most gloriously. In short, my dear, we
         had a comfortable family quarrel—love
         quarrels are easily made up—but of money
         quarrels there is no end.—From the moment
         these money quarrels commenced,
         I began to hate <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>—before I
         had only despised him—You can have
         no notion to what meanness extravagance
         reduces men.—I have known <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>
         shirk, and look so shabby, and tell
         so many lies to people about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
         guineas</measure>—a <measure ana="#currency #commodity">hundred guineas</measure>! What do I
         say? About <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">five</measure>!—O, my
         dear, I cannot bear the thoughts of it!—
         But I was going on to tell you, that my 
         good <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers>, and all <rs type="persGroup">my relations</rs>, quarrelled
         with me for having ruined myself, as 
         they said—but I said, they quarrelled with
         me for fear I should ask them for some of
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">74</fw>
         their <quote rend="quotes" source="#shakespeare_caesar"><hi rend="allcaps">vile trash</hi></quote>.—Accordingly I abused
         and ridiculed them, one and all; and
         for my pains, all my acquaintance said
         that, <said><persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was a woman of a
         vast deal of spirit.</said> 
         </p>
         <p>We were relieved from our money
            embarrassments by the timely death of a
            <ecda:anonPers>rich nobleman</ecda:anonPers>, to whose large estate my
            <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> was heir at law. I was intoxicated
            with the idle compliments of all
            my acquaintance, and I endeavoured to
            console myself for misery at home, by
            gayety abroad. Ambitious of pleasing universally,
            I became the worst of slaves—a
            slave to the world.—Not a moment of my
            time was at my own disposal—not one of my
            actions; I may say, not one of my
            thoughts, was my own—I was obliged to
            find things <quote rend="quotes">charming</quote> every hour, which
            tired me to death: and every day it was
            the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation.
            You wonder to hear me speak
            in this manner, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, but one must
            speak the truth sometimes; and this is
            what I have been saying to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>
            continually—continually, for these ten 
            years past. Then why persist in the same
            kind of life, you say?—Why, my dear,
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">75</fw>
            because I could not stop—I was fit for
            this kind of life, and for no other—I could
            not be happy at <emph>home</emph>, for what sort of a
            companion could I have made of <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>?
            By this time he was tired of his 
            <ecda:fauna>horse <name ana="#flora #food">Potato</name></ecda:fauna>, and his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Highflier</name></ecda:fauna>, and
            his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Eclips</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Goliah</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Jenny
            Grey</name></ecda:fauna>, &amp;c. and he had taken to hard
            drinking, which soon turned him, as you
            see, quite into a beast.—I forgot to tell
            you, that I had <rs type="persGroup">three children</rs> during the
            first five years of my marriage. The first
            was a <ecda:anonPers>boy</ecda:anonPers>; he was born dead; and my 
            lord, and all his <rs type="persGroup">odious relations</rs>, laid the
            blame upon me; because I would not be
            kept prisoner half a year by an <ecda:anonPers>old mother</ecda:anonPers> 
            of his, a vile <name ref="#cassandra_0001">Cassandra</name>, who was always
            prophesying, that my <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> would
            not be born alive.—My second child was a
            <ecda:anonPers>girl</ecda:anonPers>, but a poor, dimunitive, sickly thing.
             —It was the fashion at this time for <rs type="persGroup">fine
             mothers</rs> to suckle their own <rs type="persGroup">children</rs>—so
             much the worse for the poor <rs type="persGroup">brats</rs>.—Fine 
             nurses never made fine children. There 
             was a prodigious rout made about the
             matter; a vast deal of sentiment and sympathy,
             and compliments and inquiries; but
             after the novelty was over, I became hear-
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">76</fw>
             tily sick of the business; and at the end
             of about three months my poor <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> was
             sick too—I don't much like to think of it
             —it died.—If I had put it out to nurse,
             I should have been thought by my <rs type="persGroup">friends</rs>
             an unnatural mother—but I should have
             saved it's life. I should have bewailed
             the loss of the <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers> more, if <rs type="persGroup"><persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> 
             relations</rs> and <rs type="persGroup">my own</rs> had not made
             such lamentations upon the occasion, that
             I was stunned.—I couldn't or wouldn't
             shed a tear, and I left it to the <ecda:anonPers>old dowager</ecda:anonPers>
             to perform in public, as she wished,
             the part of chief mourner, and to comfort
             herself in private, by lifting up her hands
             and eyes, and railing at me as the most
             insensible of mothers. All this time I
             suffered more than she did; but that is
             what she shall never have the satisfaction 
             of knowing. I determined, that if ever
             I had another child, I would not have the
             barbarity to nurse it myself. Accordingly,
             when my third child, a <rs type="person">girl</rs>, was
             born, I sent it off immediately to the
             country, to a <ecda:anonPers>stout, healthy, broad-faced
             nurse</ecda:anonPers>, under whose care it grew and flourished;
             so that at three years old, when it
             was brought back to me, I could scarcely
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">77</fw>
             believe the chubby little thing was my own
             child. The same reasons, which convinced
             me I ought not to nurse my own child,
             determined me <foreign xml:lang="fr">à plus forte raison</foreign>, not to
             undertake it's education. <persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName>
             could not bear the child because it was not
             a boy. The girl was put under the care 
             of a <ecda:anonPers>governess</ecda:anonPers>, who plagued my heart
             out with her airs and tracasseries for
             three or four years; at the end of which
             time, as she turned out to be <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName>
             mistress in form, I was obliged—in 
             form—to beg she would leave my house,
             and I put her pupil in better hands, I
             hope, at a celebrated academy for young
             ladies. There she will, at any rate, be
             better instructed than she could be at 
             home.—I beg your pardon, my dear, for 
             this digression on nursing and schooling,
             but I wanted only to explain to you why
             it was, that when I was weary of the 
             business, I still went on in a course of 
             dissipation. You see I had nothing at 
             home, either in the shape of husband or
             children, to engage my affections. I believe
             it was this <quote rend="quotes" source="#cowper_god">aching void</quote> in my heart,
             which made me, after looking abroad some
             time for a bosom friend, take such a pro-
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">78</fw>
             digious fancy to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>. She was
             just then coming into fashion—she struck
             me the first time I met her, as being
             downright ugly; but there was a wild
             oddity in her countenance which made
             one stare at her, and she was delighted to
             be stared at—especially by me—so we
             were mutually agreeable to each other—I
             as starer, and she as staree. <persName ref="#harriot_freke">Harriot Freke</persName>
             had, without comparison, more assurance
             than any man or woman I ever saw. She
             was downright brass—but of the finest
             kind—<rs type="properAdjective">Corinthian</rs> brass—She was one of
             the first who brought what I call <mcr rend="italic">harum 
             scarum</mcr> manners into fashion. I told you
             that she had assurance—<emph>impudence</emph> I
             should have called it, for no other word is
             strong enough—Such things as I have
             heard <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> say!—You will not
             believe it; but her conversation at first absolutely
             made me, like an old-fashioned
             fool, wish I had a fan to play with. But
             to my astonishment, all this <emph>took</emph> surprisingly
             with a set of fashionable young men.
             I found it necessary to <emph>reform</emph> my manners.
             If I had not taken heart of grace,

             cated—<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> sprightly elegance
             —allow me to speak of myself in the style
             in which the newspaper writers talk of me
             —<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> sprightly elegance was
             but pal—not to say <emph>faded</emph> pink, compared 
             with the scarlet of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke's</persName> dashing
             audacity. As my rival, she would on certain
             ground have beaten me hollow; it was
             therefore good policy to make her my 
             friend. We joined forces, and nothing
             could stand against us. But I have no
             right to give myself credit for good policy 
             in forming this intimacy; I really followed 
             the dictates of my heart of my imagination.
             There was a frankness in <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName>
             manner, which I mistook for artlessness of
             character. She spoke with such unbounded
             freedom on certain subjects, that I gave
             her credit for unbounded sincerity on all
             subjects. She had the talent for making the
             world believe <emph>that</emph> virtue to be invulnerable
             by nature, which disdained the common
             outworks of art for it's defence. I, 
             amongst other, took it for granted, that
             the woman who could make it her sport to
             <quote source="#pope_lady">touch the brink of all we hate</quote>, must have
             a stronger head than other people.—I
             have since been convinced, however, of my
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">80</fw>
             mistake.—I am persuaded that few can
             touch the brink without tumbling headlong
             down the precipice—Don't apply this, my
             dear, <emph>literally</emph>, to the person of whom we
             were speaking. I am not base enough to
             betray her secrets, however I may have
             been provoked by her treachery. Of her
             character and history you shall hear
             nothing, but what is necessary for my own
             justification. The league of amity between
             us was scarcely ratified, before my <persName ref="#md">lord
             Delacour</persName> came with his wise remonstrating
             face, to beg me to <quote><said>consider what was
             due to my own honour and his</said></quote>.—Like
             the <rs type="person" ref="#ephraim_jenkinson_0001">cosmogony-man</rs> in the <title ref="goldsmith_vicar"><rs type="person" ref="#charles_primrose_0001">vicar of

             cant phrase, which had once stood him in
             stead.—<said>Do you think, my lord,</said> said I, 
             <said>that because I gave up <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> to
             oblige you, I shall give up all common
             sense, to suit myself to your taste?—<persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot

             is obvious, my lord.</said>—Pertness
             in dialogue, my dear, often succeeds better
             with my lord than wit.—I therefore

             for <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>. I, of course, repeated
             her every word which had passed between
             my husband and me. She out
             Heroded <persName ref="#herod_the_great_74">Herod</persName> upon the occasion; and
             laughed so much at what she called my 
             folly in <emph>pleading guilty</emph> in the <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
             cause, that I was downright ashamed of
             myself, and purely to prove my innocence,
             I determined, upon the first convenient
             opportunity, to renew my intimacy with
             the colonel. The opportunity which I so
             ardently desired of redeeming my independence,
             was not long wanting.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
             as my stars (which you know are always 
             more in fault than ourselves) would have
             it, returned just at this time from the
             continent, where he had been with his
             regiment; he returned with a <seg ana="#injury">would 
             across his forehead, and a black fillet
             which made him look something more
             like a hero, and ten times more like a 
             coxcomb, than ever.</seg>—He was in fashion
             at all events, and amongst other ladies,
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>—odious <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>!
             smiled upon him.—The Colonel, however,
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">82</fw>
             had taste enough to know the difference 
             between smile and smile; he laid himself
             and his <ecda:flora>laurels</ecda:flora> at my feet, and I carried
             him and them about in triumph. Wherever
             I went, especially to <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>,
             envy and scandal joined hands to attack 
             me, and I heard wondering and whispering
             wherever I went. I had no object in view
             but to provoke my husband, therefore conscious
             of the purity of my intentions, it
             was my delight to brave the opinion of the
             wondering world. I gave myself no concern
             about the effect my coquetry might
             have upon the object of this flirtation—
             poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>!—heart, I took it for granted,
             he had none—how should a coxcomb
             come by a heart?—Vanity I knew he
             had in abundance, but this gave me
             no alarm, as I thought that if it should
             ever make him forget himself—I mean
             forget what was due to me—I could, by
             one flash of my wit, strike him to the 
             earth, or blast him for ever. One night
             we had been together at <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>
             —she amongst other good things, kept a
             faro bank—and I am convinced,c hated
             —Be that as it may, I lost an immensity
             of money, and it was my pride to lose
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">83</fw>
             with as much gayety as any body else
             could win; so I was, or appeared to be
             in uncommonly high spirits, and <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
             had his share of my good humour. We
             left <placeName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</placeName> together early; about
             half past one. As the colonel was going
             to hand me to my carrige, a smart-looking
             young man, as I thought, came up
             close to the coach door, and stared me
             full in the face: I was not a woman to be
             disconcerted at such a thing as this, but
             I really was startled when the young fellow
             jumped into the carriage after me: I
             thought he was mad: I had only courage
             enough to scream.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> seized hold
             of the intruder to drag him out, and out 
             he dragged the youth, exclaiming in a
             high tone—<said>What is the meaning of all
             this, sir?—Who the devil are you?—My
             name's <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>:—who the devil are
             you?</said> The answer to this was a convulsion
             of laughter. By the laugh, I knew
             it to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>.—<said>Who am I!
             only a <name>Freke</name>!</said> cried she—<said>shake hands.</said>
             I gave her my hand, into the carriage 
             she sprang, and desired the Colonel to
             follow her: <persName>Lawless</persName> laughed, we all
             laughed, and drove away. <said>Where do
                 <pb/>

             the gallery of the <orgName>House of Commons</orgName>;
             almost squeezed to death these four hours;
             but I swore I'd hear <persName ref="#richard_sheridan_1751">Sheridan's</persName> speech
             to-night, and I did—Betted fifty guineas
             I would, with <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, and ahve
             wone.—Fun and <name>Freke</name> for ever, huzza!</said>
             <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> was mad with spirits, and so
             noisy and unmanageable, that, as I told
             her, I was sure she was drunk.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
             in his silly way, laughed incessantly, and
             I was so taken up with her oddities, that, 
             for some time, I did not perceive we were
             going the <name>Lord</name> knows where; till, at last,
             when the 'larum of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> voice ceased
             for an instant, I was struck with the strange
             sound of the carriage. <said>Where are we?
             Not upon the stones, I'm sure;</said> said I;
             and putting my head out of the window, I
             saw we were beyond the turnkpike.—<said>The
             <ecda:anonPers>coachman's</ecda:anonPers> drunk as well as you, <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>,</said>
             said I; and was going to pull the 
             string to stop him, but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> had hold
             of it.—<said>The man is going very right,</said>
             said she, <said>I've told him where to go.—
             Now don't fancy that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> and I are
             going to run away with you.—All this is 
             unnecessary now-a-days, thank <name>God</name></said>—
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">85</fw>
             To this I agreed, and laughed for fear
             of being ridiculous.—<said>Guess where you
             are going,</said> said <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>.—I guessed and
             guessed, but could not guess right; and
             my merry companions were infinitely diverted
             with my perplexity and impatience,
             more especially, as I believe, in spite of
             all my efforts I grew rather graver than 
             usual. We went on to the end of <placeName>Sloane-
             street</placeName>, and quite out of town; at last we
             stopped.—It was dark, the <ecda:anonPers>footman's</ecda:anonPers> flambeau
             was out, I could only just see by the
             lamps, that we were at the door of a lone,
             odd looking house.—The house door
             opened, and an <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> appeared with
             a lantern in her hand.             
         </p>
         <p><said>Where is this farce, or freak, or whatever
         you call it, to end?</said> said I, as <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
         pulled me into the dark passage along
         with her.

         <p><said xml:id="s009" prev="#s008">Alas! my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady

         <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> swore at the colonel, for the veriest
         <emph>spoil-sport</emph> she had ever seen, and she
         whispered to me—<said>the reason he laughs
         is, because he is afraid of our suspecting
         the truth of him, that he believes <foreign xml:lang="fr">toute de

         that.</said>—The <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers>, whose cue I
         found was to be dumb, opened a door at
         the top of a narrow staircase, and pointing
         to a tall figure, completely enveloped
         in fur, left us to our fate. I will not 
         trouble you with a pompous description
         of all the mummery of the scene, my dear,
         as I despair of being able to frighten
         you out of your wits. I should have been

             <fw type="pageNum">87</fw>
         downright angry with <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> for
         bringing me to such a place, but that I
         knew women of the first fashion had been 
         with <persName ref="#mrs_w_0001">Mrs. W―</persName>before us—some in
         somber sadness—some by way of frolic—
         So as there was no fear of being ridiculous,
         there was no shame, you know, and
         my conscience was quite at ease. <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
         had no conscience, so she was always 
         at ease; and never more so than in male
         atire, which she had been told became 
         her particularly. She supported the character 
         of a young rake with such spirit
         and <emph>truth</emph>, that I am sure no common
         conjurer could have discovered any thing
         feminine about her. She rattled on with
         a set of nonsensical questions; and among
         other things, she asked, <said>How soon will

         shocked me, in spite of all my real and all
         my assumed levity. O that I had, at this

         —There was a tone of contempt in the
         last words, which piqued me to the quick;
         and, however strange it may seem, I was
         now anxious to convince <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> that
         I was not afraid of myself—False shame
         made me act, as if I had no shame—You
         would not suspect me of knowing any
         thing of false shame, but depend upon it,
         my dear, many, who appear to have as
         much assurance as I have, are secretly it's
         slaves.—I moralize, because I am come to
         a part of my story, which I should almost
         be glad to omit—but I promised you, that
         there should be no sinse of omission. It
         was light, but not broad daylight, when
         we got to <placeName>Knightsbridge</placeName>. <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> encouraged,
         for I cannot deny it, by the 
         levity of my manner, was in higher and more familiar
         spirits than I ever saw him.—<persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>
         desired me to set her down at her <ecda:anonPers>sister's</ecda:anonPers>   
         who lived in <placeName>Grosvenor Place</placeName>.—I did so,
         and I beg you to believe, that I was in an
         agony to get rid of my colonel at the 
         same time; but you know, I could not,
         before <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>, absolutely say to
         him—<said>Get out!</said>—Indeed, to tell things
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">90</fw>
         as they were, it was scarcely possible to
         guess by my manner, that I was under
         any anxiety—I acted my part so well, or
         so ill.—As <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> jumped out of
         the coach, a <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crowed in the area of
         her <ecda:anonPers>sister's</ecda:anonPers> house, <said>There!</said> cried <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>,
         <said>do you hear the <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crow, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour?</persName>—</said>
         <said>Now it's to be hoped your fear
         of goblins is over—else I would not be
         so cruel, as to leave the pretty dear all
         alone.</said>—<said>All alone,</said> answered I—<said>your
         friend the colonel is much obliged to you
         for making nobody of him.</said>—<said>My friend
         the cololnel,</said> whispered <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>, leaning
         with her bold masculine arms folded upon
         the coach door—<said>My friend the colonel is
         much obliged to me, I'm sure, for remembering  
         what the cunning, or the knowing
         woman told us just now, that you and he are
         —or are to be—one and the same person.
         So when I said I left you alone, I
         was not guilty of a bull, was I?</said>—I had
         the grace to be heartily ashamed of this
         speech, and called out in utter confusion
         —<said>to <placeName>Berkeley Square</placeName>.―But where shall 
         I set you down, colonel<sic>!</sic>—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>, good
         morning—don't forget you are in man's 
         clothes.</said>—I did not dare to repeat the 
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">91</fw>  
         question of <said>where shall I set you down,
         colonel?</said> at this instant, because <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
         gave me such an arch sneering look, as
         much as to say—still afraid of yourself!—
         We drove on—I'm persuaded that the 
         confusion which, in spite of all my efforts,
         broke through my affected levity, encourated 
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was natrually a coxcomb
         and a fool, to believe that I was
         actually his—else he never could have
         been so insolent.—In short, my dearh, before
         we had got through the turnpike gate,
         I was downright obliged to say to him—
         <said>Get out!</said>—which I did with a degree 
         of indignation, that quite astonished him.
         —He muttered something about ladies
         knowing their minds—and I own, though
         I went off with flying colours, I secretly
         blamed myself as much as I did him, and 
         I blamed <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> more than I did either.
         —I sent for her the next day as soon as I 
         could, to consult her. She expressed such
         astonishment, and so much concern, at 
         this catastrophe of our night's frolic, and
         blamed herself with so many oaths, and
         execrated <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> for a coxcomb so much
         to the ease and satisfaction of my conscience,
         that I was confirmed in my good
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">92</fw>
         opinion of her, and indeed felt for her the
         most lively affection and esteem—for observe,
         with me esteem ever followed affection,
         instead of affection following esteem.
         —Wo be to all, who in morals preposterously
         put the cart before the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>!—But
         to proceed with my history—all fashionable
         historians stop to make reflections,
         supposing that no one else can have the 
         sense to make any. My <emph>esteemed</emph> friend
         agreed with me, that it would be best for 
         all parties concerned to hush up this business;
         that as <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was going out of
         town in a few days, to be elected for a
         borough, we should get rid of im in the
         best way possible, without <quote>more last
         words</quote>—that he had been punished sufficiently
         on the spot, and that to punish
         twice for the same offence, once in private
         and once in public, would be contrary to
         the laws of <name>Englishmen</name> and <name>Englishwomen</name>,
         and in my case would be contrary to
         the evident dictates of prudence—because
         I could not complain, without calling up
         <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> to call <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> out—This
         I could not do without acknowledging
         that his lordship had been in the right,
         in warning me about his <quote rend="italic">honour and my
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">93</fw>
         own</quote>, which old phrase I dreaded to hear
         for the ninety-ninth time; besides, <persName ref="#md">lord
         Delacour</persName> was the last man in the world
         I should have chosen for my knight—
         though unluckily he was my lord—Besides,
         all things considered, I thought the
         whole story might not tell so well in the 
         world for me, tell it which way I would
         —We therefore agreed, that it would be
         most expedient to hold our tongues. We 
         took it for granted, that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> would
         hold his, and as for my people, they knew
         nothing, I thought, or if they did, I was
         sure of them. How the thing got abroad,
         I could not at the time conceive, though
         now I am well acquainted with the baseness
         and treachery of the woman I called
         my friend.—The letter was known and
         talked of every where the next day, and
         the story was told especially at the odious
         <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>, with such exaggerations
         as drove me almost mad.—I was
         enraged, inconceivably enraged with <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
         from whom I imagined the reports originated.

          </p>
          <p>But we think that a duel concerning
           ourselves must be more extraordinary 
           than any other. We hear of men being
           shot in duels about nothing every day,
           so it is really a weakness in me to think
           so much about poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless's</persName> death, as
           <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> said to me at the time.—
           She expected to see me show sorrow in
           <emph>public</emph>—but very fortunately for me, she
           roused my pride—which was always 
           stronger than my reason; and I behaved
           myself upon the occasion as became a fine
           lady.—There were some things, however,
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">97</fw>
           I could hardly stand.—You must know
           that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, fool and coxcomb as he
           was, had some magnanimity, and showed
           it—as some people do from whom it is
           least expected—on his deathbed. The

           <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.</said>—This he said to his mother
            —who—to complete my misery—is
            one of the most respectable women in
            <placeName>England</placeName>, and was most desperately fond
            of <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was an only son.—She
            never has recovered his loss.—Do you
            remember asking me who a tall elderly
            lady in mourning was, that you saw getting 
            into her carriage one day, at <placeName><placeName>South-

            at the time.—I meet her every now and
            then—to me a spectre of dismay.—But
            as <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> said, certainly such a
            man as poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was a useless being
            in society, however he may be regretted
            by a doating mother.—We should see
            things in a philosophical light if we can.—
            I should not have suffered half as much as
            I did, if he had been a man of a stronger

            understanding; but he was a poor, vain,
            weak creature, that I actually drew on
            and duped with my own coquetry, whilst
            all the time I was endeavouring only to
            plague <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.—I was punished
            enough by the airs his lordship doubly 
            gave himself, upon the strength of his
            valour and his judgment—they roused me
            completely—and I blamed him with all
            my might, and got an enormous party of
            <rs type="persGroup">my friends</rs>, I mean my acquaintance,
            to run him down full cry, for having
            fought for me—It was absurd—It was

            being a great faro-player, was a great
            dabbler in politics; for she was almost as
            fond of power as of money: she talked
            loud and fluently, and ahd, somehow or
            other, partly by intriguing, partly by relationship,
            connected herself with <rs type="persGroup">some of
            the leading men in <orgName>parliament</orgName></rs>.—There

            —At the first news of an election, out
            comes a flaming advertisement from <persName ref="#luttridge_0002">Mr.

            new scene for me; but I piqued myself
            on the versatility of my talents, and I laid
            myself out to please all the squires, and, 
            what was more difficult, all the squires'
            ladies in <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. I was ambitious to
            have it said of me, <said>that I was the finest

            —O ye <name>*****shireians</name>, how hard did I

            before the election, enabled us to sustain
            the expence of my apotheosis.—The day
            of election came—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> and I
            made our appearance on the hustings,
            dressed in splendid party uniforms; and
            before us, our knights and squires held
            <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">two enormous panniers full of ribands and
            cockades</ecda:commodity>; which we distributed with a
            grace that won all hearts, if not all votes.
            —<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> thought the panniers
            would carry the election; and forthwith
            she sent off an express for a pair of pannier
            twice as large as ours. I took out
            my pencil, and drew a caricature of <quote>the <ecda:fauna>ass</ecda:fauna> 
            and her panniers</quote>: wrote an epigram at
            the bottom of it; and the epigram and
            the caricature were soon in the hands of
            half <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. The verses were as bad
            as impromptus usually are, and the drawing
            was not much better than the writing,
            but the <emph>good will</emph> of the critics supplied
            all my deficiencies; and never was more
            praise bestowed upon the pen of <persName ref="#edmund_burke_1729">Burke</persName>,
            or the pencil of <persName ref="#joshua_reynolds_1723">Reynolds</persName>, than was lavished

            —My dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, if you will not
             quarrel with the quality, you may have
             what quantity of praise you please.—
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I hoped and expected,
             was beyond measure enraged at the
             sight of the caricature and epigram.—
             She was, besides being a gamester and
             a politician—what do you think?—an
             excellent shot!—She wished, she said, to
             be a man, that she might be qualified to
             take proper notice of my conduct.—The
             same kind friends who shewed her my 
             epigram, repeated to me her observation
             upon it. <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> was at my elbow,
             and offered to take any <emph>message</emph> I might
             think proper to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. I scarcely
             thought her in earnest, till she added,
             that the only way left, now-a-days, for a
             woman to distinguish herself, was by
             spirit; as every thing else was grown
             <said>cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men</said>—
             That she knew <ecda:anonPers>one of the cleverest young
             men</ecda:anonPers> in <placeName>England</placeName>, and a man of fashion
             into the bargin, who was just going to
             publish a treatise <title>upon the Propriety
             and Necessity of Female Duelling</title>; and
             that he had demonstrated beyond a possibility
             of doubt, that civilized society could
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">102</fw>
             not exist half a century longer without
             this necessary improvement. I had prodigious 
             deference for the masculine superiority,
             as I thought it, of <persName ref="#hf">Harriot's</persName> understanding.
             She was a philosopher, and
             a fine lady—I was only a fine lady—I had
             never fired a pistol in my life; and I was
             a little inclined to cowardice; but <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> 
             offered to bet any wager upon the
             steadiness of my hand, and assured me
             that I should charm all beholder in male
             attire—In short, as my second, if I would
             furnish her with proper credentials, she
             swore she would undertake to furnish me
             with clothes, and pistols, and courage, and
             every thing I wanted.—I sat down to pen
             my challenge. When I was writing it,
             my hand did not tremble <emph>much</emph>—not more
             than my <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> always does.
             The challenge was very prettily worded—
             I believe I can repeat it.

             all I know is, it was not half as
             neatly worded as my note; but the essential
             part of it was, that she accepted 
             my challenge <emph>with pleasure</emph>, and should
             do herself the honour of meeting me at
             six o'clock the next morning—that <persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">miss

             upon the occasion—and that pistols were
             the weapons she preferred. The place of
             appointment was behind an old barn, about
             <measure>two miles</measure> from the town of <placeName>*****</placeName>. The
             hour was fixed to be early in the morning,
             to prevent all probability of interruption.
             In the evening, <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> and I
             rode to the ground. There were several 
             bullets sticking in the posts of the Barn:

              be no physical, and less moral necessity
              for my fighting this duel, but I did not
              venture to reason on a point of honour
              with my spirited second. I bravadoed to

              night, when <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> was undressing me,
              I could not forbear giving her a hint,
              which I thought might tend to preserve
              the <rs type="person" ref="george_III_england_1738">king's</rs> peace, and the peace of the
              county. I went to the ground in the 
              morning, in good spirits and with a safe
              conscience. <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> was in admiration of
              my <quote rend="quotes" source="gray_bard"><ecda:fauna>lion</ecda:fauna>-port</quote>: and to do her justice,
              she conducted herself with great coolness
              upon the occasion; but then it may be 
              observed, that it was I who was to stand
              fire, and not she. I thought of poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
              a billion of times at least, as we were 
              going to the ground; and I had my presentiments,
              and my confused notions of
              poetic justice—but poetic jutice, and all
              other sorts of justice, went clear out of
              my head, when I saw my antagonist and
              her friend actually pistol in hand, waiting

              O, those laws of honour!—I was upon
              the point of making an apology, in spite
              of them all, when, to my inexpressible
              joy, I was relieved from the dreadful alternative
              of being shot through the head, 
              or of becoming a laughing-stock for life,
              by an incident, less heroic I'll grant you,

              I am credibly informed, and internally
              persuaded, always find the clearness of

              large herd of <ecda:fauna>squeaking, grunting pigs</ecda:fauna>.—
              The person was clad in splendind regimentals,
              and he was armed with a long
              pole, to the end of which hung a bladder,
              and his <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> were frightened, and they ran
              squeaking from one side of the road to the
              other; and the <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver in regimentals
              in the midst of the noise, could not without
              difficulty make his voice heard; but at 
              last he was understood to say, that a bet
              of a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred guineas</measure> depended upon his
              being able to keep these <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> a head of a
              flock of <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> that were following them,
              and he begged the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> to give him and 
              his <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> fair play.—At the news of this 
              wager, and at the sight of the gentleman

              turned <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver, the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> were in raptures,

          <said xml:id="s014" prev="#s013"><p><persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> shouted in a stentorean
              voice, which actually made your <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver
              start: she explained to him in <name>Frenc</name>
              our distress, and the cause of it. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>

              He answered <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> in <name>French</name>—<said>To
              attempt your rescue by force would be
              vain—but I will do better, I will make a

              our hero, addressing himself to the sturdy

              —<said>Huzza, my boys! <placeName>Old England</placeName> for

          </p>
          <p>As he spoke, the <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> officer</ecda:anonPers>, with
              whom <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> had laid the
              wager, appeared at the turn of the lane—
              his <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> half flying—half hobbling up
              the road before him.—The <ecda:anonPers><name>Frenchman</name></ecda:anonPers>
              waved a red streamer over the heads of
              his flock—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> shook a pole, from the 
              top of which hung a bladder full of <ecda:flora>beans</ecda:flora>.
              The <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> grunted—the <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> gobbled,
              and the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> shoulted—eager for the fame
              of <placeName>Old England</placeName>, the crowd followed <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
              with loud acclamations.—The
              <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> officer</ecda:anonPers> was followed with groans
              and hisses.—So great was the confusion,
              and so great the zeal of the patriots, that
              even the pleasure of ducking the female
              duellists was forgotten in the general enthusiasm.
              —All eyes and hearts were intent
              upon the race—and now the <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna>
              got foremost—and now the <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna>.—But
              when we came within sight of the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>-
              pond, I heard <ecda:anonPers>one man</ecda:anonPers> cry—<said>don't forget
              the ducking.</said>—How I trembled! but our
              knight shouted to his <rs type="persGroup">followers</rs>—<said>For the

          </p> 
            <p>The whole fury of the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> was by 
               this speech conducted away from us.—
               <said>On, on, mu boys, into town, to the market-
               place; whoever gains the market-
               place first, wins the day.</said>—Our general
               shook the rattling bladder in triumph, over
               the heads of <quote source="#burke_reflections">the swinish multitude</quote>, as 
               we followed in perfect security in his train
               into the town.             
          </p>
          <p><rs type="persGroup">Men, women, and children</rs>, crowded

             <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> to us; we were close to him.—
             <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> pushed her way into a
              <ecda:anonPers>milliner's</ecda:anonPers> shop, I could not get in after
              her, for a <ecda:fauna>frightened pig</ecda:fauna> turned back suddenly,
              and almost threw me down. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
              Hervey</persName> caught me, and favoured my
              retreat into the shop. But poor <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
              lost his bet by his gallantry. Whilst he
              was manœuvring in my favour, the <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna>
              got several yards ahead of the <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna>,
              and reaching the market-place first, won
              the race.

               <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> represented to the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs>, that he
               was a prisoner on his parole, and that it 
               would be unlike <name>Englishmen</name>, to insult a
               prisoner.—So he got off without being
               pelted, and they both returned in safety
               to the house of <persName ref="#general_y_0001">General―</persName>, where
               they were to dine, and where they entertained
               a large party of officers with the
               account of this adventure.             
           </p>   
           <p><persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName> and I rejoiced in our
               escape, and we thought that the whole
               business was now over—but in this we 
               were mistaken. The news of our duel,
               which had spread in the town, raised such
               an uproar as had never been heard, even
               at the noisiest election.—Would you believe
               it? The fate of the election turned
               upon this duel.—The common people,
               one and all, declared, that they would not
               vote either for <persName ref="#luttridge_0002">Mr. Luttridge</persName> or <persName ref="#freke_0002">Mr.
               Freke</persName>, because <mcr rend="italic">as how</mcr>—But I need not
               repeat all the <emph>platitudes</emph> that they said.—
               In short, neither <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #textile">ribands</ecda:commodity> nor <ecda:food ana="#commodity #circulation">brandy</ecda:food> could
               bring them to reason. With true <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
               pig-headedness, they went every man of

               forsooth, was a proper behaved woman.              
           </p>   
           <p>The only thing I had to console me
               for all this, was <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> opinion,
               that I looked better in man's clothes,
               than my friend <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>.—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
               was charmed with my spirit and grace,
               but he had not leisure at that time to
               attach himself seriously to me, or to any
               thing.—He was then, I guess, about
               nineteen or twenty; he was all vivacity,
               persumption, and paradox; he was enthusiastic
               in support of his opinions, but
               he was at the same time the most candid
               man in the world; for there was no set 
               of tenets which could be called exclusively
               his; he adopted in liberal rotation
               every possible absurdity, and to do him
               justice, defended each in it's turn with the
               most ingenious arguments that could be
               devise,d and with a flow of words which
               charmed the ear if not the sense.—His
               essay on female duelling was a most extraordinary
               performance; it was handed
               about in manuscript till it was worn out,
               he talked of publishing it, and dedicating 
               it to me. However, this scheme, amongst
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">116</fw>
               a million of others, he <emph>talked of</emph>, but never
               put into execution.—Luckily for him,
               many of his follies evaporated in words.—
               I saw but little either of him or his follies
               at this time.—All I knew about him is,
               that after he had lost his bet of a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
               guineas</measure> as a <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver, by his knight
               errantry in rescuing the female duellists
               from a <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs>, he wrote a very charming
               copy of verses upon the occasion; and
               that he was so much provoked by the
               stupidity of <rs type="persGroup">some of his brother officers</rs>,
               who could not understand the verses, that
               he took a disgust to the army, and sold
               his commission. He set out upon a tour
               to the continent, and I returned with <persName ref="#hf">Harriot
               Freke</persName> to <placeName>London</placeName>, and forgot the existence
               of such a person as <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
               for three or four years.—Unless people
               can be of some use, or unless they are
               actually present, let them be ever so 
               agreeable or meritorious, we are very apt
               to forget them.—One grows strangely
               selfish by living in the world.—'Tis a
               perfect cure for romantic notions of gratitude,
               and love, and so forth.—If I had
               lived in the country in an old manor
               house, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> would have
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">117</fw>
               doubtless reigned paramount in my imagination,
               as the deliverer of my life, &amp;c.
               But in <placeName>London</placeName> one has no time for thinking
               of deliverers. And yet what I did
               with my time I cannot tell you—'Tis
               gone, and no trace left—One day after
               another went, I know not how—Had I
               wept for every day I lost, I'm sure I
               should have cried my eyes out before this
               time.—If I had enjoyed any amusement
               in the midst of this dissipation, it would
               all have been very well; but I declare to
               you in confidence, I have been tired to
               death.—Nothing can be more monotonous
               than the life of a hacknied fine lady
               —I question whether a <ecda:fauna>dray-horse</ecda:fauna>, or a
               <ecda:fauna>horse in a mill</ecda:fauna>, would willingly exchange
               places with one—if they could know as 
               much of the matter as I do.—You are
               surprised at hearing all this from me. My 
               dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, how I envy you!—You are
               not yet tired of every thing.—<mcr rend="italic">The world</mcr>
               has still the gloss of novelty for you—But
               don't expect that can last above a season.
               —My first winter was certainly entertaining
               enough.—One begins with being 
               charmed with the bustle and glare, 
               and what the <name>French</name> call <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">spectacle</foreign>; this is

               <fw type="pageNum">118</fw>
               over, I think, in six months.—I can but
               just recollect having been amused at the
               Theatres, and the Opera, and the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>,
               and <placeName>Ranelagh</placeName>, and all those places,
               for their own sakes.—Soon, very soon we 
               go out to see people, not things.—Then
               we grow tired of seeing people—
               and then we go o out, merely because we
               can't stay at home.—A dismal story, and
               a true one.—Excuse me fore showing you
               the simple truth; well dressed falsehood
               is a personage much more <emph>presentable</emph>.—
               I am now come to an epoch in my history,
               in which there is a dearth of extraordinary
               events—What shall I do?—Shall I
               invent—I would if I could—but I cannot
               —Then I must confess to you, that during
               these last four years I should have died
               of ennui if I had not been kept alive by
               my hatred of <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, and of my

               Luttridge</persName> the most—for a woman can
               always hate a woman more than she can 
               hate a man, unless she has been in love
               with him—which I never was with poor
               <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.—Yes! I certainly hate
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">119</fw>
               <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> the most—I cannot count
               the number of extravagant things I have
               done on purpose to eclipse her.—We have
               had rival routs, rival concers, rival galas,
               rival theatres—she has cost me more than
               <emph>she's</emph> worth—But then I certainly have
               mortified her once a month at least.—
               My hatred to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, my dear,
               is the remote cause of my love for you

               is really a clever woman, she knows

               and acquaintance to her own advantage.
               —To serve lovers, is a thankless office,
               compared with that of serving <emph>haters</emph>—
               polite haters I mean.—It may be dangerous,
               for aught I know, to interpose in the 
               quarrels of those who hate their neighbours,
               not only with all their souls, but
               with all their strength–the barbarians
               fight it out, kiss, and are friends.—The
               quarrels which never come to blows are
               safer for a go-between; but even these
               are not to be compared to such as never
               come to words—Your true silent hatred is
               that which lasts for ever. The moment it 
               was known that <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> and I had
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">120</fw>
               came to the resolution never to speak to
               one another, your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName> began to
               minister to my hatred so, that she made
               herself quite agreeable. She, one winter,
               gave me notice that my adversary had
               set her heart upon having a magnificent
               entertainment, on a particular day. On 
               that day, I determined, of course, to have
               a rival gala.–<ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> maid</ecda:anonPers> had a
               lover, a <ecda:anonPers>gardener</ecda:anonPers>, who lived at <placeName>Chelsea</placeName>;
               and the <ecda:anonPers>gardener</ecda:anonPers> had an <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>, which was
               expected soon to blow. Now, a plant that
               blows but once in a hundred years is
               worth having. The <ecda:anonPers>gardener</ecda:anonPers> intended to
               make a public exhibition of ot; by which
               he expected to gain about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
               guineas</measure>.—Your <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>'s maid</ecda:anonPers> got
               it from him, for me, for <measure ana="#currency #commodity">fifty</measure>; and I had
               it whispered about, that an <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> in full
               blow, would stand in the middle of one of
               <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> supper tables.—The difficulty 
               was to make <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> fix upon
               the very day we wanted; for you know 
               we could not possibly put off the blowing
               of our <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>.—Your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName> managed
               the thing admirably, by m eans of
               a <emph>common friend</emph>, who was not a suspected
               person with the <name>Luttridges</name>—in short, my
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">121</fw>
               dear, I gained my point—every body
               came from <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName> to me, or to
               my <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>.—She had a prodigiously fine
               supper, but scarcely a soul staid with her;
               they all came to see, what could be seen
               but once in a hundred years.—Now, the
               <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>, you know, is of a cumbersome
               height for a supper ornament.—My
               saloon luckily has a dome, and under the
               dome we placed it.—Round the huge
               china vase in which it was planted, we
               placed the most beautiful, or rather the 
               most expensive, <ecda:flora>hot-house plants</ecda:flora> we could 
               procure.—After all, the <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> was an ugly 
               thing—but it answered my purpose—it
               made <persName ref="#luttridg_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I am credibly informed,
               absolutely weep with vexation.—
               I was excessively obliged to your <persName ref="#ss">aunt
               Stanhope</persName>, and I assured her, that if ever
               it were in my power, she might depend 
               upon my gratitude.—Pray, when you
               write, repeat the same thing to her, and
               tell her, that since she has introduced <persName ref="#bp">Belinda
               Portman</persName> to me, I am a hundred times
               more obliged to her than ever I was before.
               —But to proceed with my important
               history.—I will not tire you, with fighting 
               over again all my battles, in my seven
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">122</fw>
               years' war with <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>.—I believe
               love is more to your taste than hatred;
               therefore I will go on as fast as possible,
               to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> return from his travels.
               —He was much improved by them;
               or at least I thought so, for he was heard 
               to declare, that after all he had seen in
               <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName>, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> appeared
               to him the most charming woman, <emph>of her
               age</emph>, in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.—The words, <quote rend="quotes">of her age</quote>,
               piqued me, and I spared no pains to make
               him forget them—a stupid man cannot
               readily persuaded out of his senses—
               what he sees, he sees, and neither more
               nor less—but 'tis the easiest thing in the 
               world to catch hold of a man of genius—
               you have nothing to do but appeal from 
               his senses to his imagination; and then
               he sees with the eyes of his imagination,
               and hears with the ears of his imagination;
               and then no matter what the age, beauty,
               or wit of the charmer may be—no matter 
               whether it be <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> or <persName ref="#bp">Belinda
               Portman</persName>—I think I know <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName>
               character <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">au fin fond</foreign>, and I could
               lead him where I pleased—but don't be
               alarmed, my dear, you know I can't lead
               him into matrimony.—You look at me,
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">123</fw>
               and from me—and you don't well know
               which way to look.—You are surprised
               perhaps, after all that passed, all that I 
               felt, and all that I still feel about poor
               <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, I should not be cured of coquetry
               —So am I surprised—but habit, fashion,
               the devil, I believe, lead us on—and then,
               <persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour</persName> is so obstinate and jealous
               —you can't have forgotten the <emph>polite conversation</emph> 
               that passed one morning at 
               breakfast between his lordship and me,
               about <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>—but neither does
               his lordship know, nor does <persName ref="#ch">Clarence 
               Hervey</persName> suspect, that my object with him
               is to conceal from the world, what I cannot
               conceal from myself, that I am a dying
               woman.—I am, and I see you think
               me, a strange, weak, inconsistent creature
               —I was intended for something better—
               but now it is too late—a coquette I have 
               lived, and a coquette I shall die—I speak
               frankly to you—let me have the glory of
               leading <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> about with me
               in public for a few months longer, then
               I must quit the stage.—As to love, you
               know with me, that is out of the question;
               all I ask or wish for is admiration.

           <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> paused, and leaned back
               on the sofa—she appeared in great pain.
           </p>
           <p><said>Oh!—I am, sometimes,</said> resumed she,
            <said>as you see, in terrible pain.—For two
             years after I gave myself that blow with
             the pistol, I neglected the warning twinges
             that I felt from time to time.—at last
             I was terrified.—<persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> was the only
             person to whom I mentioned my fears,
             and she was profoundly ignorant.—She
             flattered me with false hopes, till, alas! it
             was in vain to doublt of the nature of my 
             complaint.—Then she urged me to consult 
             a physician—that I would not do—I
             could not—I never will consult a physician
             —I would not for the universe have my
             situation known.—You stare—you cannot
             enter into my feelings. Why, my dear, if
             I lose admiration, what have I left?—
             Would you have me live upon pity?—
             Consider, what a dreadful thing it must
             be to me, who have no friends, no family,
             to be confined to a sick room—a sick bed
             —'tis what I must come to at last—but
             not yet—not yet—I have fortitude—I
             should despise myself if I had no species
             of merit—besides, it is still some occupa-
                <pb/>
                <fw type="pageNum">125</fw>
             tion to me, to act my part in public—and
             bustle, noise, nonsense, if they do not
             amuse, or interest me, yet they stifle reflection
             —may you never know what it is to
             feel remorse!—The idea of that poor
             wretch, <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, whom I actually murdered,
             as much as if I had shot him,
             haunts me whenever I am alone—it is now
             between eight and nine years since he
             died, and I have lived ever since in a
             constant course of dissipation—but it won't
             do—Conscience! conscience will be heard.
             —Since my health has been weakened, I
             believe I have acquired more conscience
             —I really think that my stupid lord, who
             has neither ideas nor sensations, except
             when he is intoxicated, is a hundred times
             happier than I am—But I will spare you,
             <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>—I promised that you should not
             have a <emph>scene</emph>, and I will keep my word—
             It is, however, a great relief to open my 
             mind to one who has some feeling—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot
             Freke</persName> has none—I am convinced that
             she has no more feeling than this table.—
             I have not yet told you how she has used 
             me.—You know that it was she who led, or
             rather dragged me, into that scrape with
             <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>—For that I never reproached her.

              —For this I never reproached her—She
              has cost me my peace of mind—my health
              —my life—She knows it, and she forsakes,
              betrays, insults, and leaves me to
              die—I cannot command my temper sufficiently 
              to be coherent when I speak of
              her—I cannot express in words what I
              feel—How can that most treacherous of 
              beings, for ten years, make me believe that
              she was my friend?—Whilst I thought
              she really loved me, I pardoned her all

              word!—All, all I forgave, and continually
              said—<emph>but</emph> she has a good heart—A good
              heart!—She has no heart! She has no

              of fashion ebbed, and then she was left
              sticking knee deep in the mud; a ridiculous,
              scandalous figure; I had the courage

              on me—nay, hints that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless's</persName> death-
              bed declaration of my innocence was
              <emph>very generous</emph>.—O, the treachery, the
              baseness of this woman!—and it was my
              fate to hear all this last night, at the masquerade
              —I waited, and waited, and looked
              every where for <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>—she was to be
              the <persName ref="#widow_brady_0001">widow Brady</persName>, I knew—At last the
             <persName ref="#widow_brady_0001">widow Brady</persName> made her appearance, and I
              accosted her with all my usual familiarity.
             —The widow was dumb—I insisted upon
             knowing the cause of this sudden loss of 
             speech—The widow took me into another 
             apartment, unmasked, and there I beheld
             <persName ref="#freke_0003">Mr. Freke</persName>, the husband.—I was astonished,
             had no idea of the truth—<said>Where is
             <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>?</said> I believe were the first words I
             said—<said>Gone to the country.</said>—<said>To the
             country!</said>—<said>Yes; to <placeName>―shire</placeName>, with <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs.

             Luttridge</persName>! I could scarcely believe my
             senses—<persName ref="#freke_0003">Freke</persName>, who always hated me,
             believing that I led his wife, instead of 
             her leading me into mischief, would have
             enjoyed my astonishment and my rage—
             so I concealed both, with all possible presence
             of mind.—He went on overwhelming
             me with explanations and copies of
                <pb/>
                <fw type="pageNum">130</fw>
             letters; and declared it was at <persName ref="#hf">Mrs.
             Freke's</persName> request he did and said all this;
             and that he was to follow her early the
             next morning to <placeName>―shire</placeName>.—I broke
             from him, simply wishing him a good
             journey, and as much family piece as 
             his patience merited.—He knows that I
             know his wife's history, and though <emph>she</emph>
             has no shame, he has some.—I had the
             satisfaction to leave him blushing with
             anger, and I supported the character of
             the comic muse a full hour afterward,
             to convince him, that all their combined
             malice would fail to break my spirit—in
             public—what I suffer in private, is known
             only to my own heart.

           <p>As she finished these words, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
              rose abruptly, and hummed a new 
              opera air. Then she retired to her boudoir,
              saying, with an air of levity to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
               as she left the room—

           <p><persName ref="#ld"><hi rend="smallcaps">Lady</hi> Delacour's</persName> history, and the manner
               in which it was related, excited in
               <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mind astonishment—pity—admiration
               —and contempt.—Astonishment 
               at her inconsistency—pity for her misfortunes
               —admiration of her talents—and
               contempt for her donduct.—To these emotions
               succeeded the recollection of the
               promise which she had made, not to leave
               her in her last illness at the mercy of an
               insolent attendant. This promise <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
               thought of with terror—she dreaded
               the sight of sufferings which she knew
               must end in death—she dreaded the sight 
               of that affected gaity, and of that real
               levity which so ill became the condition
               of a dying woman.—She trembled at the
               idea of being under the guidance of one
               who was so little able to conduct herself;
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">132</fw>
               and she could not help blaming her <persName ref="#ss">aunt
               Stanhope</persName> severely, for placing her in such
               a perious situation. It was obvious that
               some of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> histrory must have
               been known to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>; and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
               the more she reflected, was the more surprised  at her aunt's ahving
               chosen such a chaperon for a young woman
               just entering into the world. When
               the understanding is suddenly roused and
               forced to exert itself, what a multitude of
               deductions it makes in a short time.—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
               saw things in a new light; and for
               the first time in her life she reasoned for
               herself upon what she saw and felt. It
               is sometimes safer for young people to see,
               than to hear of certain characters. At
               a distance, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had appeared
               to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> the happiest person in
               the world; upon a nearer view, she discovered 
               that her ladyship was one of the 
               most miserable of human beings. To
               have married her niece to such a man as
               <persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour</persName>, <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> would have
               thought the most fortunate thing imaginable;
               but it was now obvious to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
               that neither the title of viscountess, nor the 
               pleasure of spending three fortunes, could
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">133</fw>
               ensure felicity. <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> confessed,
               that in the midest of the utmost luxury and
               dissipation she had been a constant prey 
               to ennui; that the want of domestic happiness
               could never be supplied by that public 
               admiration, of which she was so ambitious;
               and that the immoderate indulgence
               of her vanity had led her, by inevitable
               steps, into follies and imprudence,
               which had ruined her health, and destroyed
               her peace of mind—<said>If <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
               with all the advantages of wealth, rank,
               wit and beauty, has not been able to 
               make herself happy in this life of fashionable
               dissipation,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> to herself,
               <said>why should I follow the same course,
               and expect to be more fortunate?</said>
             </p>     
            <p>It is singular that the very means, which
             <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> had taken to make a fine
                lady of her niece, tended to produce an
                effect diametrically opposite to what might
                have been expected.—The result of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
                reflections upon <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
                history was a resolution to profit by her
                bad example; but this resolution it was
                more easy to form than to keep. Her
                ladyship, where she wished to please or
                to govern, had fascinating manners, and
                <pb/>
                <fw type="pageNum">134</fw>
                could alternately use the sarcastic powers
                of wit, and the fond tone of persuasion,
                to accomplish her purposes. It was <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
                intention, in pursuance of her new
                plans of life, to spend, whilst she remained 
                in <placeName>London</placeName>, as little money as possible
                upon superfluities and dress. She had,
                at her own disposal, only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">100l.</measure> per annum,
                the interest of her fortune; but
                beside this, her aunt, who was desirous
                that she should go to court, and make
                a splendid figure there, had sent her a
                draught on her banker for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred
                guineas</measure>. <quote>You will, I trust,</quote> said her
                aunt, at the conclusion of her letter,
                <quote>repay me when you are established in
                the world, as I hope and believe, from
                what I hear from <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> of the
                power of your charms, you will soon be,
                to the entire satisfaction of all your friends.
                Pray do not neglect to mention my friend
                <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> particularly, when you
                write next.—I understand from one who
                is well acquainted with him, and who has 
                actually seen his rent-roll, that he has a

                in which she explained her feelings and 
                views at large. In this letter she meant
                to have returned <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> draught,
                but her feelings and views changed between
                the wrtiting of this epistle, and the 
                going out of the post. <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName>, the
                milliner, came in the interim, and brought
                home <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> beautiful <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">dress</ecda:commodity>; it
                was not the sight of this, however, which

                not resist <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> raillery.

               could say about her love of independence,
               and the necessity of economy to preserve

               fine—but I shall translate it
               into plain <name>English</name>—You were mortally
               wounded the other night by some random

               —and instead of punishing them, you
               sagely and generously determined to punish
               yourself. Then, to convince this 
               youth that you have not a thought of those
               odious nets and canges, that you have no

               say to him, in as plain terms as possible—
               <said>You see, sir, a word to the wise is enough

               dressed and coquetted only to please you,
               now I shall lay aside dress and coquetry,
               since I find that they are not to your taste

               —Depend upon it, my dear, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence

            entered the room.—<said>Do, pray <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
            help me out, for the sake of this young
            lady, with a moral sentence against novel
            reading: but that might go against your
            conscience—or your interest, so we'll
            spare you.—How I regret that we had not
            the charming <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna> at the masquerade
            the other night!</said>
          </p>   
         <p>The moment her ladyship mentioned
             the masquerade, the conversation which
             had passed at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName> came full
             into <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> recollection, and
             his embarrassment was evident—not indeed
             to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who had turned away to
             look over some new music that lay upon
             a stand at the farthest end of the room,
             and she found this such a wonderfully
             interesting occupation, that she did not
             for some minutes hear, or appear to hear,
             one words of the conversation which was
             going on between <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> and <persName ref="#ld">lady
             Delacour</persName>.—At last her ladyship tapped
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">139</fw>
             her upon the shoulder, saying in a playful
             tone—<said><persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, I arrest your attention
             at the suit of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>—this
             gentleman is passionately fond of music—
             to my curse—for he never sees my harp
             but he worries me with <choice><sic>roproaches</sic><corr>reproaches</corr></choice> for
             having left off playing upon it.—Now he 
             has just given me his word, that he will
             not reproach me again for a month to 
             come, if you will favour us with one air.
             —I assure you, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
             touches a harp divinely—she would absolutely 
             charm.</said>—<said>Your ladyship should
             not waste such valuable praise,</said> interrupted
             <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.—<said>Do you forget, that
              <persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName> and her accomplishments
             have already been as well advertised 
             as <ecda:commodity><persName ref="#george_packwood_0001">Packwood's</persName> razor strops</ecda:commodity>?</said>               
         </p>    
         <p>The manner in which these words were
             pronounced made a great impression
             upon <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and he began to
             believe it was possible, that a niece of the
             match-making <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> might not 
             be <quote rend="quotes">a compound of art and affectation</quote>.
             —<said>Though her aunt has advertised her,</said>
             said he to himself, <said>she seems to have
             too much dignity to advertise herself, and
             it would be very unjust to blame her for
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">140</fw>
             the faults of another person.—I will see

         </p> 
         <p><rs type="persGroup">Some morning visitors</rs> were announced,
             who for the time suspended <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
             Hervey's</persName> reflections; the effect of them,
             however, immediately appeared, for as
             his good opinion of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> increased
             his ambition to please her was strongly
             excited.—He displayed all hsi powers of
             wit and humour; and not only <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
             but every body present observed,
             <said direct="false">that <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, who was always the
             most entertaining man in the world, this
             morning surpassed himself, and was absolutely
             the most entertaining man in the
             universe.</said> He was mortified nonwithstanding,
             for he distinctly perceived, that 
             whilst <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> joined with ease and dignity
             in the general conversation, her manner
             towards him was grave and reserved.
             —The next morning he called earlier than
             usual, but though <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was always 
             at home to him, she was then unluckily
             dressing to go to court; he inquired
             whether <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> would accompany
             her ladyship, and he learnt from
             his friend <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, that she was not to
             be presented this day, because <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName>
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">141</fw>
             had not brough home her dress.—<persName ref="#ch">Mr.

             —<persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was gone to court—He
             asked for <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>—<said>Not at home</said>
             —was the mortifying answer, though as he
             had passed by the windows, he had heard
             the delightful sound of her harp.—He
             walked up and down in the square impatiently,
             till he saw <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> carriage
             appear.
         </p>
         <p><said>The drawing-room has lasted an unconscionable
         time this morning,</said> said he,
          as he handed her ladyship out of her 
          coach.—<said>Am I not the most virtuous of
          virtuous women,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
          <said>to go to court such a day as this?</said>—
          But whispered she, as she went up stairs,
          <said>like all other amazingly good people, I
          have amazingly good reasons for being 
          good.—<rs type="person" ref="#charlotte_of_mecklenburg_strelitz_1744">The queen</rs> is soon to give a

          my <ecda:flora>lilies of the valley</ecda:flora>—and let me
          give you a lecture, not upon heads—or
          upon hearts—but on what is of much 
          more consequence, upon hoops.–Every
          body wears hoops, but how few—'tis a
          melancholoy consideration—how very few
          can manage them!—There's my friend
          <persName ref="#lady_c_0001">lady C―</persName>; in an elegant undress she
          passes for very genteel, but put her into a
          hoop and she looks as pitiable a figure—
          as much a prisoner—and as little able to
          walk as a child in a go-cart.—She gets on,
          I grant you, and so does the poor child,
          but getting on you know is not walking.
          —O, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, I wish you had seen the
          two <rs ref="#lady_r_0001 #lady_r_0002" type="persGroup">lady R.'s</rs> sticking close to one another;
          their <ecda:anonPers>father</ecda:anonPers> pushing them on together,

          laughter, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> went on to mimic
          what she called the hoop awkwardness
          of all her acquaintance, and if these could
          have failed to divert <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, it was impossible
          for her to be serious, when she
          heard <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> declare, that he 
          was convinced he could manage a hoop as 
          well as any woman in <placeName>England</placeName>, except

      <p><said>I hold you to your word, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,</said>

          a good quarter of an hour; then the
          dresses at the drawing-room took up 
          another quarter; and, at last, the dowager
          began to give an account of sundry
          wonderful cures that had been performed
          to her certain knowledge, by her favourite
          concetrated extract or anima of <ecda:flora>quassia</ecda:flora>

           went forward to meet <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>'
          who really made his entrée with very composed
          assurance and grace—He managed
          his hoop with such skill and dexterity,
          that he well deserved the praise of being
          a universal genius. The <rs type="person" ref="#ch"><persName>countess de Pomenars</persName></rs>
          spoke <name>French</name>, and broken <name>English</name>,
          incomparably well; and she made out that

           the time of <persName ref="#marie_de_rabutin_chantal_1626">madame de Sevigné</persName>: she said

           a lock of <persName ref="#francoise_marguerite_de_sevigne_1646">madame de Grignan's</persName> fine hair.

       <p><said>I have sometimes fancied—but I believe

       <p><rs type="person" ref="#ch"><persName>Madame de Pomenars</persName></rs> acknowledged

           <persName ref="#francoise_marguerite_de_sevigne_1646">madame de Grignan</persName> to say so.            
       </p> 
     <p><said>It would be a sin, undoubtedly, to

         <fw type="pageNum">146</fw>
     here, without flattery to the living, as you

     before <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was aware of her intentions,
     dextrously let down her beautiful
     tresses—and the <rs type="person" ref="#ch"><persName>countess de Pomenars</persName></rs>
     was so much struck at the sight, that she

     </p>   
    <p>At this dangerous moment her ladyship

   </p>     
   <p>Such was the modest, graceful dignity
   of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> manners, that she
   escaped without even the charge of prudery
   —She retired to her own apartment as

   —<said>Could I obtain a private audience

 <p>In the evening <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was

it as short as you can, unless you wish that
<persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> should hear it, for she will
be down stairs in three minutes.</said>
</p>
 <p><said>In one word then, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
 can you, and will you, make my
 peace with <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>—I am much
 concerned about that foolish razor-strop
 dialogue, which she overheard at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady
 Singleton's</persName>.</said>—     
 </p>    
 <p><said>You are concerned that she overheard
 it—no doubt.</said></p>    
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">149</fw>
 <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, <said>I am
 rejoiced that she overheard it, since it has
 been the means of convincing me of my
  mistake; but I am concerned that I had 
 the presumption and injustice to judge of
 <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> so hastily.—I am convinced,
 that though she is a niece of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>,
 she has dignity of mind, and simplicity 
 of character.—Will you, my dear
 <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, tell her so?</said>     
 </p>
 <p><said>Stay,</said> interrupted <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>;
 <said>let me get it by heart—I should have
 made a terrible bad messenger of the gods
 and goddesses, for I never in my life
 could, like <persName ref="#irish_0001">Iris</persName>, repeat a message in the
 same words in which it was delivered to
 me.—Let me see—<quote><said>Dignity of mind,
 and simplicity of character</said></quote>, was not it?
 May I not say at once <said>my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
 <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> desires me to tell you,
 that he is convinced you are an angel?</said>—
 That single word <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">angel</distinct> is so expressive,
 so comprehensive, so comprehensible, it 
 contains, believe me, all that can be said
 or imagined on these occasions, <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">de part et

 </p>   
 <p><said>But,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, <said>perhaps

    <said>it has not come to <emph>that</emph> with me yet,
    <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, I promise you; but is it not
    it possible to say, that a young lady has 
    dignity of mind, and a simplicity of character,
    without having or suggesting any
    thoughts of marriage?</said>     
 </p>   
 <p><said>You make a most proper, but not
 sufficient emphatic difference between
 having, or suggesting such thoughts,</said>
 said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.—<said>A gentleman
 sometimes finds it for his interest, his 
 honour, or his pleasure, to suggest what 
 he would not for the world promise—I 
 mean perform.</said>    
 </p>   
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">151</fw>
    <p><said>A scoundrel,</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
        <said>not a gentleman, may find it for
        his honour, or his interest, of his pleasure,
        to promise what he would not perform—
        but I am not a scoundrel—I never made
        any promise to man or woman, that I did
        not keep faithfully—I am not a swindler
        in love.</said> 
    </p>
    <p><said>And yet,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>you
    would have no scruple to trifle or flatter a
    woman out of her heart.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">Cela est selon!</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> smiling,
        <said>a fiar exchange you know is no
        robbery.–When a fine woman robs me 
        of my heart, surely <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> could
        not expect, that I should make no attempt 
        upon hers.</said>—<said>Is this part of my message
        to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName><sic>?</sic>—
        <said>As your ladyship pleases,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
        <said>I trust entirely to your ladyship's discretion.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>Why I really have a great deal of
    discretion,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but you
    trust too much to it, when you expect
    that I should execute, both with propriety
    and success, the delicate commission of
    telling a young lady who is under my pro-
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">152</fw>
    tection, that a young gentleman who is a 
    professed admirer of mine, is in love with
    her, but has no toughts, and wishes to 
    suggest no thoughts of marriage.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>In love!</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
        <said>but when did I ever use the expression?
         In speaking of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
         I simply expressed my esteem and ad―</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>No additions,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, 
        <said>content your self with esteem—simply
        —and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> is safe, and you too
        —I presume.—Apropos; pray, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
        how do your esteem and <emph>admiration</emph> (I 
        may go as far as that, may not I) of <persName ref="#bp">miss
        Portman</persName> agree with your admiration of
        <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>?</said>        
    </p>        
        <p><said>Perfectly well,</said> replied <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
           <said>for all the world must be sensible, that
           <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> is a man of too much
           taste to compare a country novice in wit
           and accomplishments, to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.
           —He might, as men of genius sometimes 
           do, look forward to the idea of
           forming a country novice for a wife.—
           A man must marry some time or other—
           but my hour, thank Heaven, is not come
           yet.</said>            
        </p>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">153</fw>
      <p><said>Thank Heaven!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, 
          <said>for you know, a married man is lost to
          the world of fashion and gallantry.</said>          
      </p>
       <p><said>No more so, I should hope, than
       a married woman,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>.
        —Here a loud knocking at the door announced
        the arrival of <rs type="persGroup">company</rs> to the 
        concert.—<said>You will make my peace, you 
        promise me, with <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,</said> cried
        <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, eagerly.           
       </p>
        <p><said>Yes, I will make your peace, and you
        shall see <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> smile upon you once
        more, upon condition,</said> continued <persName ref="#ld">lady
        Delacour</persName>, speaking very quickly, as if
        she was hurried by the sound of <rs type="persGroup">people</rs> 
         coming up stairs—<said>but we'll talk of that
         another time.</said>
      </p>
      <p><said>Nay, nay, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         now, now,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, seizing her
          hand,—<said>Upon condition! upon what
          condition?</said>          
      </p>  
      <p><said>Upon condition that you do a little
          job for me—indeed for <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.—She is to
          go with me to the birthnight—and she
          has often hinted to me, that our <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> are
          shockingly shabby for people of our condition.
          —I know she wishes, that upon 
          such an occasion—her first appearance at
          court, you know—we shoud go in style.
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">154</fw>
          —Now my dear positive <rs type="person" ref="#md">lord</rs> has <emph>said</emph>, he
          will not let us have a pair of the handsomest
          <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> I ever saw which are at <orgName>Tattersal's</orgName>,
          and on which <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, I know,
          has secretly set her heart, as I have openly
          in vain.</said>
      </p>
     <p><said>Your ladyship and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
     cannot possibly set your hearts on any
     thing in vain—especially on any thing that 
     is in the power of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> to
     procure. Then,</said> added he gallantly, kissing
     her hand, <said>may I thus seal my treaty
     of peace?</said>         
     </p>
    <p><said>What audacity!—don't you see these
    <rs type="persGroup">people</rs> coming in?</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
      and she withdrew her hand, but with no
      great precipitation: she was evidently <quote rend="quotes">at
      this moment, as at all in the past</quote>, neither
      afraid nor ashamed, that <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey's</persName> devotions
      to her should be paid in public.
      With much address she had satisfied herself 
      as to his views, with respect to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.
      She was convinced that he had no
      immediate thoughts of matrimony; but
      that if he were condemned to marry, <persName ref="#bp">miss
      Portman</persName> would be his wife. As this did
        not interfere with her plans, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
        was content.

      <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, nonwithstanding all this,

      among the number of my public worshippers during my life—which
      you know cannot last long.—After I am 
      gone, my dear, he'll be all your own, and
      of that I give you joy.—Posthumous fame
      is a silly thing, but posthumous jealousy
      detestable.</said>          
      </p>          
    <p>There was one part of the conversation
        between <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> and her ladyship,
        which she, in her great discretion, did not
        immediately repeat to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>—that
        part which related to the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>.—In this
        transaction <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had no farther share,
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">156</fw>
        than having once, when her ladyship had
        the handsome <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> brought for her to
        look at, assented to the opinion, that they
        were the handsomest <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> she ever beheld.
        —<persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, however gallantly he
        replied to her ladyship, was secretly
        vexed to find that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had so little
        delicacy, as to permit her name to be employed
        in such a manner. He repented
        having used the improper expression of 
        <quote rend="italics">dignity of mind</quote>, and he relapsed into his
        former opinion of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> niece.
        —A <choice><sic>relape</sic><corr>relapse</corr></choice> is always more dangerous
        than the first disease.—He sent home the
        <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, the next day, and
        addressed <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, when he met her, with
        the air of a man of gallantry, who
        thought that his peace had been cheaply
        made.—But in proportion as his manners
        became more familiar, hers grew more
        reserved.—<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> rallied her upon
        <quote rend="italic">her pruder</quote>, but in vain.—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
        seemed to think, that her ladyship had
        not fulfilled her part of the bargain.—<said>Is 
        not <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">smiling</distinct>,</said> said he, <said>the epithet always
        applied to peace—yet I have not been
        able to obtain one smile from <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
        since I have been promised peace.</said>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">157</fw>
        —Embarrassed by <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey's</persName> reproaches,
        and provoked to find <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
        was proof against all her raillery,
        <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> grew quite ill-humoured
        towards her. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, unconscious of having
        given any just cause of offence, was
        unmoved; and her lady's embarassment
        increased.—At last, resuming all her
        former appearance of friendship and confidence,
        she suddenly exclaimed, one night
        after she had flattered <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> into high
        spirits—
    </p>            
     <p><said>Do you know, my dear, that I have 
     been so ashamed of myself for this week
     past, that I hardly dared to look you
     in the face.—I am sensible I was downright 
     rude and cross to you one day—and
     ever since I have been penitent; and as
     all penitents are, very stupid and disagreeable,
     I am sure—but tell me you forgive
     my caprice, and <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> will be
     herself again.</said>         
     </p> 
     <p>It was not difficult to obtain <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> 
         forgiveness.         
     </p> 
     <p><said>Indeed,</said> continued <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         <said>you are too good—but then, in my own
         justification I must say, that I have more
         things to make me ill-humoured than
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">158</fw>
         most people have.—Now, my dear, that
         most obstinate of human beings, <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>,
         has reduced me to the most terrible
         situation—I have made <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
         buy a pair of <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>, and I 
         cannot make my <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> pay for
         them—but I forgot to tell you, that I took
         your name—not in vain indeed—in this
         business.—I told <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, that upon condition
         he would do this <emph>job</emph> for me, you
         would forgive him for all his sins, and
         nay, my dear, why do you look as if I had
         stabbed you to the heart—after all, I only 
         drew upon your pretty mought for a few
         smiles—Pray let me see whether it has actually
         forgotten <emph>how</emph> to smile.</said>    
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was too much vexed at this
         instant to understand raillery.—She was
         inspired by anger with unwonted courage,
         and losing all fear of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> wit,
         she very seriously expostulated with her
         ladyship upon having thus used her name
         without her consent or knowledge. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         felt sure she was now in danger of being
         led into a situation, which might be fatal
         to her reputation and her happiness; and
         she was the more surprised at her ladyship,
         when she recollected the history she
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">159</fw>
         had so lately heard of <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> and

     <p><said>You cannot but be sensible, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
     said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>that after the contempt

     for match-making with <rs type="persGroup"><persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> 
     nieces</rs>, I should degrade myself by any
     attempts to attract his attention.—No wit,
     no eloquence, can change my opinion
     upon this subject—I cannot endure contempt.</said>         
     </p>
     <p><said>Very likely—no doubt</said>—interrupted
      <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but if you would only
      open your eyes, which heroines make it a
      principle never to do—or else there would 
      be an end of the novel—if you would only
      open your eyes, you would see that this
      man is in love with you; and whilst you
      are is afraid of his contempt, he is a hundred
      times more afraid of yours; and as long
      as you are each of you in such a fear of you
      know not what—you must excuse me if 
      I indulge myself in a little wholesome
      raillery.</said>—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> smiled—<said>There now,
      one such smile as that for <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
      and I am out of debt and danger,</said>
      said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.         
     </p>
     <p><said>O, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, why, why will you
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">160</fw>
     try your power over me in this manner?</said>
     said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.—<said>You know that I ought
     not to be persuaded to do what I am conscious
     is wrong.—But a few days ago you
     told me yourself, that <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> is—is
     not a marrying man; and a woman of 
     your penetration must see that—that he 
     only means to flirt with me.—I am not a
     match for <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> in any respect.—
     He is a man of wit and gallantry—I am
     unpractised in the ways of the world.—I
     was not educated by my <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>—
     I have only been with her a few years—
     I wish I had never been with her in my

    <p><said>I'll take care <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> shall know
    that,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but in the
    mean time, I do think any fair appraiser
    of delicate distresses would decide, that I
    am, all the circumstances considered, more
    to be pitied at this present moment than
    you are.—For the catastrophe of the business
    evidently is, that I must pay <measure  ana="#commodity #currency">two 
    hundred guineas</measure> for the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> some how
     or other.</said>
   <said>I can pay for them,</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
     <said>and will with the greatest pleasure.
     —I will not go to the birthnight—

     my dress is not bespoke.—Will <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred

     the money—pay <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, dear <persName ref="#ld">lady
     Delacour</persName>, and it will all be right.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>You are a charming girl,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady
    Delacour</persName>, embracing her, <said>but how can
    I answer for it to my conscience, or to
    your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>, if you don't appear
    on the birthnight?—That cannot be, my
    dear; besides, you know <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> will
    send home your drawing-room dress today,
    and it would be so foolish to be presented
    for nothing—not to go to the birthnight
    afterwards.—If you say <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">a</distinct> you must
    say <distinct rend="italic" type="mentioned">b</distinct>.</said>        
    </p>     
       <p><said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>I will not go

       nothing! Really I never saw any one so
       lavish of her money, and so economic of
       her smiles.</said>          
       </p>   
       <p><said>Surely,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, <said>it is
        better for me to throw away <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure>, 
       poor as I am, than to hazard the happiness
       of my life.—Your ladyship knows
       that if I say <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">a</distinct> to <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, I must say
       <distinct rend="italic" type="mentioned">b</distinct>.—No, no, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—here
       is the draught for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred guineas</measure>—
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">162</fw>
       pay <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, for Heaven's sake, and
       there is an end of the business.</said> 
       </p>   
       <p><said>What a positive child it is!—Well,
       then it shall not be forced to say the a, b,
       c, of <persName ref="#cupid_0001">Cupid's</persName> alphabet, to that terrible pedagogue
       <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, till it pleases—
       but seriously, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, I am concerned
       that you will make me take this
       draught.—It is absolutely robbing you.—
       But <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> the person you must
       blame—it is all his obstinacy—having
       once said he would not pay for the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>,
       he would see them and me and the whole
       human race expire, before he would change
       his silly mind.—Next month I shall have
       it in my power, my dear, to repay you,
       with a thousand thanks—and in a few 
       months more we shall have another birthday,
       and a new star shall appear in the
       firmament of fashion, and it shall be called
       <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.—In the mean time, my dear
       upon second thoughts, perhaps we can get
       <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> to dispose of your drawing-
       room dress to some person of taste, and
       you may keep your <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure> for the
       next occasion.—I'll see what can be done
       —adieu, a thousand thanks, silly child as
       you are.</said>

               What you can mean by principles and
               delicacy, I own I don't pretend to understand,
               when I see you not only forget the

               of the aunt, to whom you ow every
               thing; but you take upon yourself to
               laving her money, without common honesty.
               —I send you <measure ana="#commodity #currency">200 guineas</measure>, and

               all the particulars to me, otherwise, 
               you are sure I should approve of the reasons
               which have influenced you.—Mightly

               the matter, you tell me that you do not
               think, that in your situation in life it is necessary
               thaty ou should go to court.—Your 
               opinions and mine, you add, differ in many 
               points. Then I must say that you are
               as ungrateful, as you are presumptuous—
               for I am not such a novice in the affairs
               of this world, as to be ignorat that when
               a young lady professes to be of a different
               opinion from her friends, it is only a prelude
               to something worse. She begins by
               saying, that she is determined to think
               for herself; and she is determined to act
               for herself—and then it is all over with
               her—and all the money, &amp;c. that has

               <p rend="prequotes">Now I look upon it, that a young girl

                   by connexions, is bound to be guided implicitly 
                   by them in all her conduct.—
                   What should you think of a man, who,
                   after he had been brought into <orgName>parliament</orgName>
                   by a friend, would go and vote against

              the advice so artfully given to her in this
              epistle, was yet extremely concerned to
              find, that she had incurred the displeasure
              of an aunt to whom she thought herself
              under obligations. She resolved to lay by
              as much as she possibly could, from the
              interest of her fortune, and to repay the
              <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred guineas</measure> to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>:
              she was conscious that she had no right to
              lend this money to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, if her
              aunt had expressly desired that she should
              spend it only on her court dress; but this
              had not distinctly been expressed, when
              <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> had sent her niece the draughts.
              That lady was in the habit of speaking and
              writing ambiguously, so that even those 
              who knew her best, were frequently in
              doubut how to interpret her words. Yet
              she was extremely displeased when her
              hints, and her half-expressed wishes, were
              not understood.—Beside the concern she
              felt from the thoughts of having displeased
              her aunt, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was both vexed and
              mortified, to perceive that in <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
              Hervey's</persName> manner towards her there was 
              not the change which she had expected
              that her conduct would naturally produce.           
          </p>
          <p>
              One day she was surprised at his re-
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">168</fw>
              proaching her for her caprice in having given
              up her intentions of going to court. <persName ref="#ld">Lady
              Delacour's</persName> embarrassment whilst <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
              spoke, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> attributed to her ladyship's
              desire that <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> should not 
              know, that she had been obliged to borrow
              the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity> to pay him for the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #sale">horses</ecda:fauna>.
              <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> thought that this was a species
              of mean pride; but she made it a point
              to keep her ladyship's secret—she therefore
              slightly answered <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, <said direct="false">that
              she wondered that a man, who is so well
              acquainted with the female sex, should
              be surprised at any instance of caprice
              from a woman.</said> The conversation then
              took another turn, and whilst they were
              talking of indifferent subjects, in came
              <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> man, <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, with
              <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> draught for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred

              just brought back, because <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> 
              had forgotten to endorse it. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> astonishment
              was almost as great at this instant,
              as <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> confusion.
          </p>
          <p><said>Come this way, my dear, and we'll

              <fw type="pageNum">169</fw>
          endorse it immediately.</said>—And she took
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> into another room.
          </p>
         <p><said>Good Heavens! Has not this money

             <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         </p> 
          <p><said>No, my dear, but I will take all the

          as well for you, throw it all upon my better

          better than a poor devil of a coach-maker,
          so I paid the <ecda:anonPers>coach-maker</ecda:anonPers>, and a few
          months sooner or later can make no difference
          to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, who rolls in <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">gold</ecda:commodity>, my
          dear—if that will be any comfort to you,
          as I hope it will.</said>

          ken—<said>I must insist upon this draught's
          being given to <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName></said>  
          </p>
          <p><said>Absolutely impossible, my dear.—I
          cannot take it from the <ecda:anonPers>coach-maker</ecda:anonPers>,—he
          has sent home the <ecda:commodity>carriage</ecda:commodity>—the thing's
          done, and cannot be undone. But come,
          since I know nothing else will make you
          easy, I will take this mighty favour from
          <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> entirely upon my own conscience.
          You cannot object to that, for
          you are not the keeper of my conscience
          —I will tell <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> the whole business,
          and do you honour due, my dear—so endorse
          the note, whilst I go and sound both
          the praises of your dignity of mind, and
          simplicity of character, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
          &amp;c.</said> Her ladyship broke away from
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, returned to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
          and told the whole affair with that peculiar
          grace with which she knew how to 
          make a good story out of a bad one. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
          was as favourable an auditor at
          this time as she could possibly have found, 
          for no human being could value <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>
          less than he did, and all sense of her
          ladyship's meanness was lost in his joy at 
          discovering that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was worthy of 
          his esteem. Now he felt in it's fullest
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">171</fw>
          extent all the power she had over his heart,
          and he was upon the point of declaring
          his attachment to her, when, <quote rend="quotes"><foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">malheureusement</foreign></quote>, 
          <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName> and <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr.
          Rochfort</persName> announced themselves by the
           noise they made on the staircase. These
           were the young men who had spoken in
           such a contemptuous manner at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>
           of the match-making <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
           and her <rs type="persGroup">nieces</rs>. <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> was
           anxious that they should not penetrate
           into the state of his heart, and he concealed
           his emotion by instantly assuming
           that kind of rattling gayety, which always
           delighted his companions, who were ever
           in want of some one to set their stagnant
           ideas in motion. At last they insisted
           upon carrying <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> away with them
           to taste some <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food> for <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName>.

         <p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> his way to <placeName>St. James's street</placeName>, where
          the <ecda:anonPers><ecda:food ana="#commodity">wine</ecda:food> merchant</ecda:anonPers> lived, <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip Baddely</persName>
          picked up several <rs type="persGroup">young men</rs> of his
          acquaintance, who were all eager to witness
          a trial of <emph>taste</emph>, of epicurean taste—
          between the baronet and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>.
          Among his other accomplishments
          our hero piqued himself upon the exquisite
          accuracy of his organs of taste. He 
          neither loved <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, nor was he fond of
          eating; but at fine dinners, with young 
          men who were real epicures, <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>
          gave himself the airs of a connoisseur, and
          asserted superiority even in judging of
          <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>sauces</ecda:food>. Having gained immortal
          honour at an entertainment, by gravely
          protesting that some <ecda:food ana="#fauna">turtle</ecda:food> would have
          been excellent if it had not been done <quote rend="italic">a
          bubble too much</quote>, he presumed, elate as 
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">173</fw>   
         he was with the applauses of the <rs type="persGroup">company</rs>,
         to assert, that no man in <placeName>England</placeName>
         had a more correct taste than himself.—
         <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip Baddely</persName> could not passively submit
          to this arrogance; he loudly proclaimed,
          that though he would not dispute <persName ref="#ch">Mr.
          Hervey's</persName> judgment as far as eating was concerned,
         yet he would defy him as a connoisseur 
         in <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food>, and he offered to submit the
         competition to any eminent wine-merchant
         in <placeName>London</placeName>, and to some common friend
         of acknowledged taste and experience.—
         <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName> was chosen as the common
         friend of acknolwedged taste and experience;
         and a fashionable <ecda:anonPers>wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>
         was pitched upon, to decide with him the
         merits of these candidates for bacchanalian
         fame. <persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName>, who was just going to
         furnish his cellars, was a person of importance
         to the <ecda:anonPers>wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>, who produced
          accordingly his choicest treasures. <persName ref="#pb">Sir
          Philip</persName> and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> 
          with affected gravity; and they delivered
          their opinions of the positive and comparative 
          merits of each. The <ecda:anonPers>wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>
          evidently, as <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> thought,
          leaned towards <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>. <said>Upon my
          
          
          word, <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, you are right—that
          <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food> is the best I have—you certainly
          have a most discriminating taste,</said> said the
          complaisant <ecda:anonPers>wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>. <said>I'll tell
          you what,</said> cried <persName ref="#ph">sir Philip</persName>, <said>the thing
          is this—by G― now there's no possibility
          now—no possibility now by G― of
          imposing upon me.</said>—<said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
          Hervey</persName>, <said>would you engage to tell
          the difference between these two <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food>
          ten times running, blindfold?</said>—<said>Ten 
          times, that's nothing,</said> replied <persName ref="#pb">Philip</persName>;
          <said>yes, fifty times, I would, by G―.</said>
         </p>       
         <p>But when it came to the trial, <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>
          had nothing left but oaths in his own 
          favour. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was victorious, 
          and his sense of the importance of this
          victory was much increased by the fumes
          of the <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, which began to operate upon
          his brain. His triumph was, as he said 
          it ought to be, bacchanalian—he laughed
          and sang with <rs type="properAdjective">Anacreontic</rs> spirit, and
          finished by declaring, that he deserved
          to be crowned with <ecda:flora>vine-leaves</ecda:flora>. <said>Dine
          with me, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, <said>and
          we'll crown you three times three—
          and,</said> whispered he to <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>—<said>we'll
          have another trial after dinner.</said>
          </p>       
          <p><said>But as it's not near dinner time yet—
          only half past six by me—what shall we
          do with ourselves till dinner time?</said> said
          <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, yawning pathetically.              
          </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, not being used to drink in a
            morning, though all his companions were,
            was much affected by the <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, and <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>
            proposed that they should take a turn
            in the park to cool <persName ref="#ch">Hervey's</persName> head. To
            <placeName>Hyde-park</placeName> they repaired; <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName> boasting
             all the way they walked, of the superior
             strength of his head.              
          </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> protested that his own was
              stronger than any man in <placeName>England</placeName>, and
              observed, that at this instant he walked
              better than any person in company, <persName ref="#pb">sir
              Philip Baddely</persName> not excepted. Now <persName ref="#pb">sir
              Philip Baddely</persName> was a noted pedestrian,
              and he immediately challenged our hero to
              walk with him for any <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity> he pleased.
              <said>Done,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, <said>for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">ten guineas</measure>
              —for any <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity> you please</said>—and instantly
              they set out to walk, as <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName> cried
              <said>one, two, three, and away; keep the
              path, and whichever reaches that <ecda:flora>elm tree</ecda:flora>
              first has it.</said>
          </p>      
          <p>They were exactly even for some yards,
              then ,<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> got ahead of <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, and
              
              
              
              he reached the <ecda:flora>elm tree</ecda:flora> first; but as he
              waved his hat, exclaiming, <said><persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> has
              won the day,</said> <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName> came up with his
              <rs type="persGroup">companions</rs>, and coolly informed him that
              he had lost his wager—<said>lost! lost! lost!
              <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>; fairly lost.</said>             
          </p>      
         <p><said>Didn't I reach the <ecda:flora>tree</ecda:flora> first,</said> said
             <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>.             
         </p>       
         <p><said>Yes,</said> answered his <rs type="persGroup">companions</rs>, <said>but
         you didn't keep the path. You turned
         out of the way when you met that crowd of
         <rs type="persGroup">childen</rs>, yonder.</said> <said>Now, <emph>I</emph>,</said> said <persName ref="#pb">sir
          Philip</persName>, <said>dashed fairly through them—
          kept the path, and won my bet.</said>              
         </p>       
         <p><said><emph>I</emph>, not I,</said> said <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, <said>but I would
         have you go through with your civility—
         If a man will be polite, he must pay for
         his politeness sometimes.—You said you'd 
         lay me <emph>any money</emph> I pleased, recollect—
         now I'm very moderate—and as you are a
         particular friend, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, I'll only take
         your <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten guineas</measure>.</said>             
         </p>       
         <p>A loud laugh from his <rs type="persGroup">companions</rs> provoked
             <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>; they were glad <quote>to
             have a laugh against him</quote>, because he
             
             
             
             excited universal envy, by the real superiority
             of his talents, and by his perpetually 
             taking the lead in those trifles which
             were beneath his ambition, and exactly 
             suited to engage the attention of his
             associates.             
         </p>       
         <p><said>Be it so—and welcome—I'll pay <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten

         <said>but remember, though I've lost this bet,
         I don't give up my pedestrian fame.—<persName ref="#pb">Sir

                into the river, and seized hold of the

                <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was absolutely senseless
                —<said>Damn it, what shall we do with him

                to restore <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey's</persName> suspended animation.
                Whilst he was employed in this

           was out of the question.—But what signifies 
           all that now?—Come, come, we had

           <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who had very quick 
             feelings, was extremely hurt by the indifference
             which his dear friends had
             shown, when his life was in danger; he
             was apt to believe that he really was an
             object of affection and admiration amongst
             his companions; and that though they
             were neither very wise, nor very witty,
             they were certainly very good natured.
             When they had forfeited by their late
             conduct these claims to his regard, his
             partiality for them was changed into contempt.

                 healthy, rosy, intelligent faces towards the
                 door, the moment that they heard their
                 <rs type="person" ref="#percival_0001">father's</rs> voice. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was so
                  much struck with the expression of happiness 
                  in <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne's</persName> countenance, that
                  he absolutely forgot to compare her beauty
                  with <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>. Whether her eyes
                  were large or small, blue or hazle, he could
                  not tell; nay, he might have been puzzled
                  if he had been asked the colour of her hair.
                  —Whether she was handsome by the 
                  rules of art, he knew not; but he felt that
                  she had the essential charm of beauty, the
                  poewr of prepossessing the heart immediately
                  in her favour. The effect of her 
                  manners, like that of her beauty, was rather
                  to be felt than described. Every
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  body was at ease in her company, and
                  none thought themselves called upon to
                  admire her.—To <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who had

                  <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, this respite from the fatigue
                  of admiration was peculiarly agreeable.
                  The unconstrained cheerfulness of
                  <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival</persName> spoke of a mind at ease,
                  and immediately imparted happiness by
                  exacting sympathy; but in <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
                  wit and gayety there was an appearance
                  of art and effort, which often destroyed
                  the pleasure that she wished to
                  communicate.—Some people may admire, 
                  but none can sympathise with affectation.
                  —<persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> was, perhaps, unusually
                  disposed to reflection, by having 
                  just escaped from drowning; for he made
                  all these comparisons, and came to this 
                  conclusion, with the accuracy of a meta-
                  physician, who has been accustomed to
                  study cause and effect—indeed there was
                  no species of knowledge for which he had
                  not taste and talents, though, to please

              <p>The <rs type="persGroup">children</rs> at <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne Percival's</persName> happened
                  to be looking at some <ecda:fauna>gold fish</ecda:fauna>,
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  which were in a glass globe, and <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.
                  X―</persName>, who was a general favourite with
                  the younger, as well as with the elder part
                  of the family, was seized upon the moment
                  he entered the room: a pretty little
                  <ecda:anonPers>girl</ecda:anonPers> of five years old took him prisoner by
                  the flap of the coat, whist <rs type="persGroup">two of her brothers</rs>
                  assailed him with questions about 
                  the ears, eyes, and fins of <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna>. <ecda:anonPers>One of
                  the little boys</ecda:anonPers> fillipped the glass globe, and
                  observed, that the <ecda:fauna>fish</ecda:fauna> immediately came
                  to the surface of the water, and seemed to
                  hear the noise very quickly; but his <ecda:anonPers>brother</ecda:anonPers>
                  doubted, whether the <ecda:fauna>fish</ecda:fauna> heard the
                  noise, and remarked, that they might be
                  disturbed by seeing or feeling the motion
                  of the water, when the glass was 
                  struck.
              </p>  
               <p><persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> observed, that this was a
                   very learned dispute, and that the question
                   had been discussed by no less a person
                   than the <persName ref="#jean_antoine_nollet_1700">abbé Nollet</persName>; and he related some
                   of the ingenious experiments tried by that
                   gentleman, to decide, whether <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna> can
                   or cannot hear.—Whilst the doctor was 
                   speaking, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> was struck
                   with the intelligent countenance of one of
                   the little auditors—a girl of about ten or 
                   
                   
                   
                   twelve years old; he was surprised to discover
                   in her features, though not in their 
                   expression, a singular resemblance to <persName ref="#ld">lady
                   Delacour</persName>. He remarked this to <persName ref="#percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>,
                   and the child, who overheard him,
                   blushed as red as scarlet.—Dinner was
                   announced at this instant, and <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
                   Hervey</persName> thought no more of the circumstance,
                   attributing the girl's blush to confusion
                   at being looked at so earnestly.—
                   <ecda:anonPers>One of the little boys</ecda:anonPers> whispered as they

                   dinner, and by all the little playful manœuvres
                   in his power, endeavoured to show
                   his gratitude, and to cultivate a friendship
                   which had been thus auspiciously commenced.
                   —<persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, who piqued himself
                   upon being able always to suit his
                   conversation to his companions, distinguished
                   himself at dinner by an account 
                   
                   
                   
                   of the <ecda:fauna><rs type="properAdjective">Chinese</rs> fishing-bird</ecda:fauna>, from which

                   of fishing practiced by the <name><rs type="properAdjective">Russian</rs> 
                   Cossacks</name>. From modern he went to ancient
                   <ecda:fauna>fish</ecda:fauna>, and he talked of that which was
                   so much admired by the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> epicures
                   for exhibiting a succession of beautiful
                   colours whilst it is dying; and which was,
                   upon that account, always suffered to die
                   in the presence of the guests, as part of
                   the entertainment.—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> was led on
                   by the questions of the <rs type="persGroup">children</rs> from
                   <ecda:fauna>fishes</ecda:fauna> to <ecda:fauna>birds</ecda:fauna>; he spoke of the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs>
                   aviaries, which were so constructed, as to
                   eep from the sight of the prisoners that

                   going on to <ecda:fauna>beasts</ecda:fauna>, when he was nearly 
                   struck dumb by the forbidding severity,
                   with which an <rs type="person" ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">elderly lady</rs>, who sat opposite

                   had not, till this instant, paid the smallest
                   attention to her; but her stern countenance
                   was now so strongly contrasted with
                   the approving looks of the children who
                   sat next to her, that he could not help
                   remarking it.—He asked her to do him
                   
                   
                   the honour to drink a glass of <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food> with
                   him—She declined doing him that honour;
                   observing that she never drank more than
                   one glass of <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food> at dinner, and that she
                   had just taken one with <persName ref="#percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>.—
                   Her manner was well-bred, but haughty
                   in the extreme; and she was so passionate,
                   that her anger sometimes conquered even
                   her politeness. Her dislike to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence

                   <ecda:fauna>beasts</ecda:fauna>. The <ecda:anonPers>boy</ecda:anonPers>, who sat next to him, had
                   asked some questions about the proboscis
                   of the <ecda:fauna>elephant</ecda:fauna>, and <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> mentioned
                   <persName ref="#edward_ives_0001">Ive's</persName> account of the <ecda:fauna>elephants</ecda:fauna> in

                   with their trunks, when they go out of
                   bounds. He talked next of the <ecda:fauna>unicorn</ecda:fauna>;
                   and addressing himself to <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> and
                   <persName ref="#percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>, he declared that in his

                   chapter in the history of <ecda:fauna>beasts</ecda:fauna>

                   upon the table, he said,
               </p>
               <p><said>My lady, these <ecda:food ana="#flora">cherries</ecda:food> are a present
               from the <ecda:anonPers>old gardener</ecda:anonPers> to <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Miss Delacour</persName>.</said>                    
                </p>
                <p><said>Set them before <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">miss Delacour</persName> then,</said>
                said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>. <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>, my dear, distribute
                your own <ecda:food ana="#flora">cherries</ecda:food></p>
                <p>At the name of <name>Delacour</name>, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
                Hervey</persName>, though his head was still half full
                of the <ecda:fauna>mammoth</ecda:fauna>, looked round in astonishment,
                and shen he saw the <ecda:food ana="#flora">cherries</ecda:food> 
               placed before the <rs ref="#helena_delacour_0001">young lady</rs> he had before
                observed, he could not help exclaiming,                    
                </p>
                <p><said>That young lady then is not a daughter 
                of your ladyship's?</said></p>
                <p><said>No; but I love her as well as if she
                were,</said> replied <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>.—<said>What were
                you saying about the <ecda:fauna>mammoth</ecda:fauna>?</said>                   
                </p>
              <p><said>That the <ecda:fauna>mammoth</ecda:fauna> is supposed to 
              be―</said> but interrupting himself, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
              said in an enquiring tone—<said>A <emph>niece</emph>
              of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>?</said> 
              </p>  
              <p><said>Her <rs type="person" ref="#ld">ladyship's</rs> <emph>daughter</emph>, sir,</said> said
              
              
              
             the <ecda:anonPers>severe old lady</ecda:anonPers>, in a voice more terrific
              than her looks.</p>  
               <p><said>Shall I give you some <ecda:food ana="#flora">strawberries</ecda:food>, 
                <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>or will
               you let <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName> help you to some <ecda:food ana="#flora">cherries</ecda:food>?</said>                   
               </p>
             <p><said>Her <rs type="person" ref="#ld">ladyship's</rs> <emph>daughter</emph>!</said> exclaimed
                 <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> in a tone of surprise
             </p>  
             <p><said>Some <ecda:food ana="#flora">cherries</ecda:food>, sir?</said> said <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>,
                 but her voice faltered so much, that she
                 could hardly utter the words.
             </p>  
             <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> perceived that he had been
                 the cause of her agitation, though he
                 knew not precisely by what means, and he
                 now applied himself in silence to the
                 picking of his <ecda:food ana="#flora">strawberries</ecda:food> with great dilligence.                 
             </p>  
             <p>The <rs type="persGroup">ladies</rs> soon afterward withdrew, and
                 as <persName ref="#percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName> did not touch upon the
                 subject again, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> forebore to ask any
                 farther questions, though he was considerably 
                 surprised by this sudden discovery.—
                 When he went into the drawing-room to
                 <ecda:food>tea</ecda:food>, he found his friend, the stern <rs type="person" ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">old 
                 lady</rs>, speaking in a high declamatory tone.
                 —The words which he heard as he came
                 into the room were—                 
             </p>  
              <p><said>If there were no <name ref="#ch">Clarence Herveys</name>,
              
              
              there would be no <name ref="#ld">lady Delacours</name>.</said>—
              <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> bowed, as if he had received a
               high compliment—the <rs type="person" ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">old lady</rs> walked
               away to an antichamber, fanning herself
               with great energy.

              </p> 
              <p><said>And that is never <emph>cool</emph>,</said> said a <ecda:anonPers>young
              lady</ecda:anonPers>, who sat next to <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>—<said>I call
              <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName> the volcano; I'm
              sure I am never in her company without
              dreading an explosion.—Every now and
              then out comes, with a tremendous noise,
              fire, smoke, and rubbish.</said>

              <p><said>But the best of it is,</said> continued the 
              <ecda:anonPers>young lady</ecda:anonPers>, <said>that she is seldom in a passion
              without making a hundred mistakes,
              for which she is usually obliged afterward
              to ask a thousand pardons.</said>                  
              </p> 
              <p><said>By that account,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>,
                <said>which I believe to be just, her contrition

              <p><said>Now you talk of contrition, <persName ref="#ap">lady

              sorry that my indiscreet questions gave
              <persName ref="#anne_delacour_0001">miss Delacour</persName> any pain—my head was so
              full of the <ecda:fauna>mammoth</ecda:fauna> that I blundered on
              without seeing what I was about, till it
              was too late.</said>                  
              </p> 
             <p><said>Pray, sir,</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName>,
               who now returned, and took her
               seat upon a sofa, with the solemnity of a
               person who was going to sit in judgment
               upon a criminal—<said>pray, sir, may I ask
               how long you have been acquainted with
               my <persName ref="#ld">my lady Delacour</persName>?</said>                 
             </p>  
              <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> took up a book, and

               and answered,
              </p> 
              <p><said>To the best of my recollection, madam,
              it is now four years since I had first

              </p> 
             <p><said>And in that time, intimately as you
             have had the pleasure of being acquainted
             with her <rs type="person" ref="#ld">ladyship</rs>, you have never discovered
             that she had a daughter?</said>                 
             </p> 
             <p><said>Never,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>                 
             </p> 
             <p><said>There, <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>!—There!</said> cried
                 
                 
                 
             <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, <said>will you tell me after</said>
              this, that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> is not a monster?
             </p> 
             <p><said>Such a mother was never heard of,</said>
               continued <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, <said>since the
               days of <persName>Savage</persName> and <persName>lady Macclesfield</persName>.—I
               am convinced that she <emph>hates</emph> her daughter.
               —Why she never speaks of her—she
               never sees her—she never thinks of her!</said>  
             </p>  
            <p><said>Some mothers speak more than they
            think of their children, and others think
            more than they speak of them,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady

            </p>   
           <p><said>I always thought,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>,
               <said>that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was a woman of great
               sensibility.</said>
           </p>    
           <p><said>Sensibility!</said> exclaimed the the indignant
               <rs type="person" ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">old lady</rs>—<said>She has no sensibility, sir—
               none—none.—She who lives in a constant
               round of dissipation; who performs no 
               one duty; who exists only for herself;
               how does she show her sensibility?—Has
               she sensibility for her husband—for her
               daughter—for any one useful purpose 
               upon earth?—O, how I hate the cambrick
               
               
               
               handkerchief sensibility, that is brought
               out only to weep at a tragedy!–Yes;
               <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> has sensibility enough, I
               grant ye, when sensibility is the fashion.
               —I remember well her performing the
               part of a nurse with vast applause; and
               I remember, too, the <emph>sensibility</emph> she
               showed, when the <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> that she nursed
               fell a sacrifice to her dissipation.—The second
               of her <rs type="persGroup">children</rs>, that she killed—</said>               
           </p>    
           <p><said>Killed!—O, surely my dear <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs.
           Delacour</persName>, that is too strong a word,</said> said
           <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>—<said>You would not make a
           <name>Medea</name> of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.</said>               
           </p>    
            <p><said>It would have been better if I had,</said>
               cried <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>—<said>I can understand
               that there may be such a thing in nature as
               a jealous wife, but an unfeeling mother
               I cannot comprehend—That passes my
               powers of imagination.</said>
            </p>   
            <p><said>And mine, so much,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>,
               <said>that I cannot believe such a being to exist
               in the world—notwithstanding all the 
               descriptions I have heard of it: as you
               say, my dear <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, it passes my
               powers of imagination.—Let us leave it
               in <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey's</persName> apocryphal chapter of
               <ecda:fauna>animals</ecda:fauna>, and he will excuse us if I never
               
               
               
               admit it into true history—at least without
               some better evidence than I have yet
               heard.</said>                
            </p>   
            <p><said>Why, my dear, dear <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>,</said>
                cried <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>—<said>bless me, I've
                made this <ecda:food>coffee</ecda:food> so sweet, there's no

            </p>   
            <p><said>None,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, smiling, <said>I

            </p>   
            <p><said>That is to say, you will take none,</said>
              said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>: <said>but can any thing
              be stronger evidence than her <rs ref="#ld" type="person">ladyship's</rs> 
              conduct to <emph>my</emph> poor <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helen</persName>—to <emph>your</emph> <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>
              I should day—for you have educated,
              you have protected her, you have been a
              mother to her.—I am an infirm, weak,
              ignorant, passionate old woman—I could
              not have been what you would have been to that
              child—God will bless you!—God will
              bless you!</said>  
            </p>   
            <p>She rose as she spoke, to set down her
              <ecda:food>coffee-cup</ecda:food> on the table. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
               took it from her with a look which said
               much, and which she was perfectly capable
               of understanding.
            </p>   
           <p><said>Young man,</said> said she, <said>it is very unfashionable

           politeness.—I wish that your friend <persName ref="#ld">lady

           with as much respect, as she has met with
           admiration and gallantry in her youth.—
           Poor woman, her head has absolutely
           been turned with admiration—and if fame
           say true, <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> has had his share
           in turning that head by his flattery.</said>               
           </p>    
           <p><said>I am sure her ladyship has turned

            <p><said>We learn the value of all things, but
            especially of friends, by experience,</said> said
            <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>; <said>and it is no wonder, therefore,
            that those who have little experience
            
            
            of the pleasures of friendship should not
            be wise enough to know their value.</said>                
            </p>   
            <p><said>This is very good natured sophistry—
            but <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> is too vain ever to have
            a friend,</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>.—<said>My
            dear <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, you don't know her as

            ever woman had.</said>                
            </p>   
            <p><said>That is certainly a great deal,</said>
             said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>but then we must consider,
             that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, as an heiress, a

            </p>   
             <p><said>Both her fortune and her beauty are

             <p><said>O, no,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>you must
             not give her up yet.—I have been informed,
             and upon <emph>the best authority</emph>, that
             <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was not always the unfeeling
             dissipated fine lady that she now appears 
             to be. This is only one of the transformations 
             of fashion—the period of her

            <p>Then turning to the <ecda:anonPers>young lady</ecda:anonPers> she
              began—<said>Once upon a time there lived
              an <ecda:anonPers>old gardener</ecda:anonPers> at <placeName>Kensington</placeName>; and this
              <ecda:anonPers>old gardener</ecda:anonPers> had an <ecda:flora ana="#commodity">aloe</ecda:flora>, which was older
              than himself; for it was very near a hundred
              years of age, and it was just going to
              blossom, and the <ecda:anonPers>old gardener</ecda:anonPers> calculated
              how much he might make by showing his
              <ecda:flora ana="#commodity">aloe</ecda:flora>, when it should be in full blow, to
              the generous public—and he calculated
              that he might make <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred pounds</measure>;
              and with this <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred pounds</measure> he determined
              to do more than ever was done
              with a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred pounds</measure> before: but, unluckily,
              as he was thus reckoning his blos-
              
              
              ssoms before they were blown, he chanced
              to meet with a <ecda:anonPers>fair damsel</ecda:anonPers>, who ruined all
              his calculations.</said>                
            </p> 
           <p><said>Ay, <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> maid</ecda:anonPers>, was not
           it?</said> interrupted <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName>.
           <said>A pretty damsel she was, and almost
           as good a politician as her mistress.—
           Think of that jilt's tricking this <ecda:anonPers>poor old
           fellow</ecda:anonPers> out of his <ecda:flora ana="#commodity">aloe</ecda:flora>—and—O, the meanness
           of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, to accept of that
           <ecda:flora ana="#commodity">aloe</ecda:flora> for one of her extravagant entertainments!</said>               
           </p>
           <p><said>But I always understood that she paid
           <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure> for it,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName>.               
           </p>   
          <p><said>Whether she did or not,</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs.

          between them were the ruin of this
          poor <ecda:anonPers>old man</ecda:anonPers>.—He was taken in to marry
          that jade of a <ecda:anonPers>waiting-maid</ecda:anonPers>; she turned
          out jsut as you might expect from a pupil 
          of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>—the match-making
          <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>—you know, sir.</said> (<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> 
          changed colour.)<said>She turned 
          out,</said> continued <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, <said>Every
          thing that was bad—ruined her husband
          —ran away from him—and left him a 
          beggar.</said>              
          </p>     
          <p><said>Poor man!</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>.
          </p>     
             
             
             
          
          
          <p><said>But now,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said>let's
          come to the best part of the story—mark
          how good comes out of evil.—If this poor
          man had not lost his <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> and his <ecda:anonPers>wife</ecda:anonPers>, I
          probably should never have been acquainted
          with <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, or with
          my little <persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>—About the time that
          the <ecda:anonPers>old gardener</ecda:anonPers> was left a begger, as I
          happened to be walking out one fine evening
          in <placeName>Sloane-street</placeName>, I met a procession of
          <rs type="persGroup">school girls</rs>—an <ecda:anonPers>old man</ecda:anonPers> begged from 
          them in a most moving voice; and as they
          passed, several of the <rs type="persGroup">young ladies</rs> threw
          <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">halfpence</ecda:commodity> to him.—One little girl, who
          observed that the <ecda:anonPers>old man</ecda:anonPers> could not stoop
          without great difficulty, staid behind the
          rest of her <rs type="persGroup">companions</rs>, and collected the
          <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">halfpence</ecda:commodity> which they had thrown to the
           <ecda:anonPers>old man</ecda:anonPers>, and put them into his had.—He
          began to tell his story over again to her,
          and she stayed so long listening to it, that
          her <rs type="persGroup">companions</rs> had turned the corner of
          the street, and were out of sight.—She
          looked about in great distress; and I never
          shall forget the pathetic voice with which
          she said, <said>O what will become of me?
           every body will be angry with me?</said>—I
          assured her that nobody should be angry
          
          
          with her, and she gave me her little hand
          with the most innocent confidence.—I
          took her home to her <ecda:anonPers>schoolmistress</ecda:anonPers>, and
          I was so pleased with the beginning of
          this acquaintance, that I was determined
          to cultivate it.—One good acquaintance I
          have heard always leads to another.—<persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>
          introduced me to her <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">aunt Delacour</persName>,
          as her best friend.—<persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName>
          has the goodness to let her little 
          niece spend the holidays, and all her leisure
          time with me, so that our acquaintance
          has grown into friendship.—<persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>
          has become quite one of my family.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And I am sure she has become quite
          a different creature, since she has been so
          much with you,</said> cried <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>,
          <said>her spirits were quite broken by her <rs ref="#ld" type="person">mother's</rs>
          neglect of her—young as she is, she
          has a great deal of real sensibility—but as
          to her mother's sensibility―</said>
          </p>    
          <p>At the recollection of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
            neglect of her child, <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName> was
            going again to launch forth into indignant
            invective, but <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName> stopped her, by
            whispering—
          </p>     
          <p><said>Take care what you say of the
          <rs type="person" ref="#ld">mother</rs>, for here is the <rs type="person" ref="md">daughter</rs> coming,
          
          
          
          and she has, indeed, a great deal of real
          sensibility.</said>              
          </p>     
         <p><persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName> and her <rs type="persGroup">young companions</rs> now
             came into the room, bringing with them
             the sulphurs at which they had been
             looking.
         </p>     
          <p><said>Mamma,</said> said little <persName ref="#charles_percival_0001">Charles Percival</persName>,
              <said>we have brought the sulphurs to you,
              because there are some of them that <emph>I</emph>

          </p>     
          <p>The <rs type="persGroup">children</rs> spread the sulphurs upon
              a little table, and all the <rs type="persGroup">company</rs> gathered
              round it.
          </p>     
         <p><said>Here are all the <rs type="persGroup">nine muses</rs> for you!</said>
           said the <ecda:anonPers>least of the boys</ecda:anonPers>, who had taken
             his seat by <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> at dinner—
             <said>Here are all the muses for you, <persName ref="ch">Mr.

             than the comic muse, do you?</said>
         </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> made no answer, for
              he was at that instant recollecting how
              <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> looked in the character of the
              tragic muse.

         <p><said>Has your ladyship ever happened to

         <p><said>I sat near her once at the opera,</said>

         mean?</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>—<said>I am sure
         if I were a young man, I would not trust
         to the charming countenance of a young 
         lady, who is a pupil of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>,
         and a friends of—<persName ref="#hd">Helena</persName>, my dear,

         <p><said>Indeed,</said> said <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne</persName>, <said><persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
         is in a dangerous situation—but some

         say, learn to be sure footed, by being left

        <p>Here <persName ref="#percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>, <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, and
          some <rs type="persGroup">other gentlemen</rs>, came up stairs to

          dangerous situations, stumbling <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>,

            shoulder—<said>the tragic muse?<sic>”</sic><corr/>—this tragic
            muse seems to rival <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> in
            your admiration.</said>
        </p>       
         <p><said>O,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, smiling, <said>you
         know I was always a votary of the
         muses.</said>             
         </p>      
         <p><said>And a favoured votary,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.
         X―</persName>. <said>I wish for the interests of literature,
         that poets may always be lovers,
         though I cannot say that I desire lovers
         should always be poets.—But <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>,
         you must never marry, remember,</said>
         continued <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, <said>never—for your
         true poet must always be miserable.—
         You know, <persName ref="#francesco_petrarch_1304">Petrarch</persName> tells us, he would
         not have been happy if he could; he
         would not have married his <persName ref="#laura_0001">mistress</persName> if it
         had been in his power; because, then
         there would have been an end of his 
         beautiful sonnets.</said>
         </p>      
         
         
         
         <p><said>Every one to his taste,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>;
             <said>for my part, I have even less ambition
             to imitate the heroism, than hope of being
             
             
             
             inspired with the poetic genius of <persName ref="#francesco_petrarch_1304">Petrarch</persName>.
             —I have no wish to pass whole
             nights composing sonnets.—I would (am
             I not right, <persName ref="#percival_0001">Mr. Percival</persName>?) infinitely
             rather be a slave of the ring, than a slave
             of the lamp.</said>             
         </p>
         <p>Here the conversation ended—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
           took his leave, and <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Margaret Delacour</persName>  
           said, the moment he had left the

      <p><said>Young, beautiful, graceful; then the

      give you my opinion of her: for the odds

      to balance these perfections.</said>
      </p>
    <p><said>A thousand faults! a charitable allowance,</said>
      daid <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, smiling.  
    </p>            
    <p><said>There now,</said> said <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>
    <quote rend="quotes" source="#pope_satire">Touch him, and no minister's so sore.</quote>

    To punish you for wincing at my first setting
    out, I promise you, that if the <rs ref="#bp" type="person">lady</rs>
    have a million of faults, each of them
    high as huge <placeName>Olympus</placeName>, I will see them
    as with the eye of a flatterer—not of a
    friend.
    </p>                 
    <p><said>I defy you to be so good, or so bad
    as your word, docor,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>.—
    <said>You have too much with to make a good
    flatterer.</said>
    </p>            
   <p><said>And perhaps you think too much to
   make a good friend,</said> said <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>.       
   </p>    
    <p><said>Not so,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, <said>I would at 
    any time rather be cut by a sharp knife
    than by a blunt one. But, my dear doctor, 
    I hope you will not be prejudiced
    against <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, merely because she is
    
    
    
    with <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>; for to my certain
    knowledge, she is not under her ladyship's
    influence. She judges and acts for 
    herself, of which I have had an instance.</said>
    </p>  
     <p><said>Very possibly!</said> interrupted <persName ref="#rx">Dr.
     X―</persName>, <said>but before we go any farther,
     will you please to tell me of what <name>Belinda</name>
     you are talking?</said>         
     </p>   
      <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName>. I forgot that I had
      not told you.</said>          
      </p>  
      <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName>, a niece of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>?</said>      
      </p>
      <p><said>Yes, but do not be prejudiced against
      her on that account,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, eagerly,
      <said>thought I was at first myself.</said>          
      </p>
       <p><said>Then you will excuse my following
       your example instead of your precepts.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, <said>for my precepts
       are far better than my example.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> received <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>
         most courteously, and thanked <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
         for introducing to her a gentleman
         with whom she had long desired to converse.
         <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName> had a great literary
         reputation, and she saw that he was a 
         perfectly well-bred man; consequently
         she was ambitious of winning his admi-
         
         
         
         ration. She perceived also that he had
         considerable influence with <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
         and this was sufficient reason to
         make her wish for his good opinion. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         was particularly pleased with his
         manners and conversation; she saw that
         he paid her much attention, and she was 
         desirous that he should think favourably
         of her; but she had the good sense and
         good taste to avoid a display of her abilities
         and accomplishments. A sensible man,
         who has any knowledge of the world and
         talents for conversation, can easily draw
         out the knowledge of those with whom
         he converses. <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName> possessed this
         power in a superior degree.
       </p>
        <p><said>Well,</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, when their
         visit was over, <said>what is your opinion of
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>I am <quote rend="quotes">blasted with excess of light</quote>,</said>
           said the <rs ref="#rx" type="person">doctor</rs>.
        </p>
        <p><said><rs type="person" ref="#ld">Her ladyship</rs> is certainly very brilliant,</said>
            said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, <said>but I hope that
            <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> did not overpower you.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>No—I turned my eyes from <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> 
        upon <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, as a painter
        turns his eyes upon mild green, to rest
        
        
        them, when they have been dazzled by
        glaring colours.
        <quote rend="quotes">She yields her charms of mind with sweet delay.</quote></said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>I was afraid,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>, <said>that
        you might think her manners too reserved
        and cold—they are certainly become
        more so than they used to be.—But so
        much the better; by and by we shall find
        beautiful <ecda:flora>flowers</ecda:flora> spring up from beneath
        the snow.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>A very poetical hope,</said> said <persName ref="#rx">Dr.
        X―</persName>; <said>but in judging of the human
        character, we must not entirely trust to
        analogies and allusions taken from the vegetable
        creation.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>What!</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, looking
            eagerly in the <rs ref="#rx" type="person">doctor's</rs> eyes—<said>What
            do you mean? I am afraid that you do not approve
            of <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Your fears are almost as precipitate
        as your hopes, my good sir—but to put
        you out of pain, I will tell you, that I
        approve of all I have seen of this young 
        lady, but that it is absolutely out of my
        power, to form a decisive judgment of
        a woman's temper and character in the
        
        
        course of a single morning visit. Women, 
        you know, as well as men, often speak
        with one species of enthusiasm, and act
        with another.—I must see your <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
        act—I must study her, before I can
        give you my final judgment.—<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>
        has honoured me with her commands
        to go to her as often as possible.
        For your sake, my dear <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>, I shall
        obey her ladyship most punctually, that I
        may have frequent opportunities of seeing
        your <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> expressed his gratitude with
         much energy, for this instance of the
         doctor's friendship. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who had
         been entertained by <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―'s</persName> conversation
         during this first visit, was more
         and more delighted with his understanding
         and character. She felt that
         he unfolded her powers, and that with the
         greatest politeness and address he raised
         her confidence in herself, without ever
         descending to flattery. By degrees <supplied reason="flawedReproduction">s</supplied>he
         learned to look upon him as a friend;
         she imparted to him with great ingenuousness
         her opinions on various subjects
         and she was both amused and instructed
         
         
         by his observations on the characters and
         manners of the company who frequented
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> assemblies. She did not
         judge of the doctor's sincerity merely by
         the kindness he showed her, but by his 
         conduct towards others.
        </p>
        <p>One night, at a select party at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
           a <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> gentleman</ecda:anonPers> was amusing
           the <rs type="persGroup">company</rs> with some anecdotes, to
           prove the extraordinary passions which
           some of his countrymen formerly showed
           for the game of chess. He mentioned families,
           in which unfinished games, bequeathed
           by will, had descended from father
           to son, and where victory was doubtful 
           for upwards of a century.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> observed, that gaining a
            battle was, at that time, so common to the 
            court of <placeName>Spain</placeName>, that a victory at chess
            seemed to confer more eclat; for that an
            <ecda:anonPers>abbé</ecda:anonPers>, by losing adroitly a game at chess
            to the <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> minister</ecda:anonPers>, obtained a cardinal's
            hat.            
        </p>
        <p>The <ecda:anonPers>foreigner</ecda:anonPers> was flattered by the manner
            in which <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName> introduced this slight
            circumstance, and he directed to him his
            conversation, speaking in <name>French</name> and
            <name>Italian</name> successively; he was sufficiently
            
            
            skilled in both languages, but <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> 
            spoke them better. Till he appeared,
            the <ecda:anonPers>foreigner</ecda:anonPers> was the principal object of 
            attention, but he was soon eclipsed by
            <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Nothing amusing or instructive
            that could be said upon the game 
            of chess escaped him, and the literary
            ground, which the slow don would have
            taken some hours to go regularly over,
            our hero traversed in a few minutes.—
            From <persName>Twiss</persName> to <persName ref="#marco_vida_1485">Vida</persName>, from <persName>Irwin</persName> to <persName>sir
            William Jones</persName>, from <placeName>Spain</placeName> to <placeName>India</placeName>, he
            passed with admirable celerity, and seized
            all that could adorn his course from <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> 
            Antiquities or <rs type="properAdjective">Asiatic</rs> Researches.            
        </p>
        <p>By this display of knowledge he surprised
            even his friend <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>. The
            ladies admired his taste as a poet, the
            gentlemen his accuracy as a critic; <persName ref="#ld">lady
            Delacour</persName> loudly applauded, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
            silently approved.—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> was elated.
            —the <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> gentleman</ecda:anonPers>, to whom he
            had just quoted a case in point from <persName>Vida's</persName>
            <title>Sacchia</title>, asked him if he were as perfect
            in the practice as in the theory of the game
            of chess. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> was too proud of excelling
            in every thing to decline the <name>Spaniard's</name> 
            challenge.—They sat down to chess.
            
            
            —<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, as they ranged the
            pieces on the board, cried—
        </p>
        <p><said>Whoever winse shall be my knight;
        and a <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">silver chess-man</ecda:commodity> shall be his prize.
            —Was it not <persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">queen Elizabeth</persName>, who gave a
            <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">silver chess-man</ecda:commodity> to <rs ref="#walter_raleigh_1554" type="person">one of her courtiers</rs> as
        a mark of her royal favour?—I am ashamed
        to imitate such a pedantic coquet—but
        since I have said it, how can I retract!</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Impossible, impossible!</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
        Hervey</persName>—<said>A <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">silver chess-man</ecda:commodity> be
        our prize; and if I win it, like the
        gallant <persName ref="#walter_raleigh_1554">Raleigh</persName> I will wear it in my cap,
            and what proud <persName ref="#robert_devereux_1565">Essex</persName> shall dare to challenge
        it!</said>            
        </p>
        <p>The combat now began—the <rs type="persGroup">spectators</rs> 
         were silent.—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> made an error in
         his first move, for his attention was distracted
         by seeing <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> behind his adversary's
         chair. The <name>Spaniard</name> was deceived
         by this mistake into a contemptuous
         opinion of his opponent—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> 
         changed her place—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> recovered
         his presence of mind, and convinced him
         that he was not a man to be despised.
         The combat was long doubtful, but at
         length, to the surprise of all present, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
         Hervey</persName> was victorious.            
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>Exulting in his success he looked round
            for <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, from whom he expected
            the honours of his triumph.—She
            had left the room, but soon she returned,
            dressed in the character of <persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">Queen Elizabeth</persName>,
            in which she had once appeared at
            a masquerade, with a large ruff, and all
            the costume of the times.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, throwing himself at
            her feet, addressed her in that high flown
            style, whic her <rs type="person">majesty</rs> was <sic>want</sic> to hear
            from the gallant <persName ref="#walter_raleigh_1554">Raleigh</persName>, or the accomplished
            <persName ref="#robert_devereux_1565">Essex</persName>.            
        </p>
        <p>Soon the coquetry of the queen entirely
            conquered her prudery; and the favoured
            courtier, evidently elated by his situation,
            was as enthusiastic as her majesty's most
            insatiable vanity could desire. The characters
            were well supported; both the 
            actor and actress were highly animated,
            and seemed so fully possessed by their 
            parts, as to be insensible to the comments
            that were made on the scene. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
            hervey</persName> was first recalled to himself by
            the deep blush which he saw on <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
            cheek, when <rs type="person" ref="#ld"><persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">queen Elizabeth</persName></rs> addressed
            her as one of her maids of honour, of 
            whom she affected to be jealous.—
            
            
            
            conscious that he had been hurried by the
            enthusiasm of the moment farther than he
            either wished or intended. It was difficult
            to recede, when her majesty seemed
            disposed to advance; but <rs ref="#ch" type="person"><persName ref="#walter_raleigh_1554">sir Walter
            Raleigh</persName></rs>, with much presence of mind,
            turned to the <ecda:anonPers>foreigner</ecda:anonPers>, whom he accosted
            as the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> ambassador.
        </p>
        <p><said>Your excellency sees,</said> said he, <said>how
        this great queen turns the head of her
        faithful subjects, and afterwards has the art
        of paying them with nothing but words.
        —Has the new world afforded you any
        coin half so valuable?</said>            
        </p>
        <p>The <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> ambassador's</ecda:anonPers> grave replies
            to this playful question gave a new turn
            to the conversation, and relieved <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
            Hervey</persName> from his embarrassment. <persName ref="#ld">Lady
            Delacour</persName>, though still in high spirits, was
            easily diverted to other objects. She too
            the <ecda:anonPers>ambassador</ecda:anonPers> with her to the next room,
            to show him a picture of <persName ref="#mary_stuart_1542">Mary, queen 
            of <name>Scots</name></persName>. The <rs type="persGroup">company</rs> followed her
            —<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> remained with <persName ref="#rx">Dr. 
            X―</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, who had just asked
            the doctor to teach her the moves at 
            chess.            
        </p>
        
        
        <p><said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> has charming spirits,</said>
            said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>; <said>they inspire
            every body with gayety.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>Every body! they incline me more 
        to melancholy than mirth,</said> said <persName ref="#rx">Dr.
        X―</persName>. <said>These high spirts do not seem
        quite natural. The vivacity and youth and
        of health, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, always charms 
        me; but this gayety of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
        does not appear to me that of a sound
        mind in a sound body.</said>            
        </p>
        <p>The <rs ref="#rx" type="person">doctor's</rs> penetration went so near
            the truth, that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, afraid of betraying
            her <rs ref="#ld" type="person">friend's</rs> secrets, never raised her
            eyes from the chess-board whilst he spoke,
            but went on setting up the falling castles,
            and bishops, and kings, with expeditious
            dilligence.            
        </p>
        <p><said>You are putting the bishop into the 
        place of the knight,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>.            
        </p>
        <p><said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>,</said> continued the <rs ref="#rx" type="person">doctor</rs>
           <said>seems to be in a perpetual fever,
           either of mind or body—I cannot tell
           which—and as a professional man, I really
           have some curiosity to determine the question.
           If I could feel her pulse, I could 
           instantly decide; but I have heard her
           
           
           
           say that she has a horror against having
           her pulse felt—and a lady's horror is invincible
           —by reason—</said> 
        </p>
        <p><said>But not by address,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
           <said>I can tell you a method of counting her
           pulse, without her knowing it—without 
           her seeing you—without you seeing her.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>Are you in earnest, <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>?</said>
            said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
        </p>
        <p><said>Perfectly in earnest—my secret is
        quite simple.—Look through the door at
        the shadow of <rs type="person" ref="#ld"><persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">queen Elizabeth's</persName></rs> ruff—observe
        how it vibrates; the motion as well
        as the figure is magnified in the shadow.—
        Cannot you count every pulsation distinctly?</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>I can,</said> said <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName>, <said>and I give
        you credit for making an ingenious use
        of a trifling observation.</said> The doctor
        paused, and looked round. <said>Those <rs type="persGroup">people</rs> 
        cannot hear what we are saying, I 
        believe?</said>
       </p>
       <p><said>O, no,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> <said>they are intent
       upon themselves.</said>           
       </p>
        
        
        
        <p><persName ref="#rx">Dr X―</persName> fixed his eyes mildly
          upon <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and exclaimed in
          an earnest friendly tone—<said>What a pity,
          <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>, that a young man of your
          talents and acquirements, a man who
          might be any thing, should—pardon the
          expression—choose to be—nothing—
          should was upon petty objects powers
          suited to the greatest—should lend his
          soul to every contest for frivilous superiority,
          when the same energy concentrated,
          might ensure honourable pre-eminence
          among the first men in his country.—Shall
          he, who might not only distinguish himself
          in any science or situation, who might
          not only acquire personal fame, but, O,
          far more noble motive!—who might be
          permanently useful to his fellow creatures,
          content himself with being the evanescent
          amusement of a drawing room?—Shall
          one, who might be great in public, or happy
          in private life, wast in this deplorable
          manner the best years of his existence—
          time that can never be recalled?</said>‒
          <said>This is declamation!</said>—<said>No: it is
          truth put to the strongest language that
          I have power to use, in the hope of making 
          some impression: I speak from my heart,
          
          
          for I have a sincere regard for you, <persName ref="#ch">Mr.
          Harvey</persName>, and if I have been impertinent, you
          must forgive me.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Forgive you!</said> cried <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
         taking <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―</persName> by the hand, <said>I
         think you a real friend—you shall have 
         the best thanks, not in words, but in actions
         —you have roused my ambition, and
         I will pursue noble ends by noble means.
         —A few years have been sacrificed—but
         the lessons that they have taught me remain.
         —I cannot, presumptuous as I am,
         flatter myself that my exertions can be of
         any material utility to my fellow creatures,
         but what I can do I will—My excellent
         friend! If I be hereafter either successful
         in public, or happy in private life, it is to
         you I shall owe it.</said>           
        </p>
       <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was touched by the candour and
         good sense with which <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
         spoke. His character appeared in a new
         light—she was proud of her own judgment,
         in having discerned his merit, and
         for a moment she permitted hself to feel
         <quote rend="quotes">unreproved pleasure in his company.</quote>
       </p>
       <p>The next morning, <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName>
           and <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName> called at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
           —<persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> was present—Her ladyship
           
           
           
           was summoned to <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName>, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
           was left with these <rs type="persGroup">gentlemen</rs>.
       </p>
       <p><said>Why, damme, <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName>! you have been
       a lost man,</said> cried <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, <said>ever since
       you were drowned—Damme, why did not
       you come to dine with us that day, now I
       recollect it?—We were all famously merry
       —but for your comfort, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, we
       missed you cursedly, and were damned
       sorry you ever took that damned unlucky 
       jump into the <placeName>Serpentine river</placeName>—damned
       sorry—were not we, <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>?</said>       
       </p>
       <p><said>O,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, in an ironical
        tone, <said>you need no vouchers to convince
        me of the reality of your sorrow.—You
        know I can never forget your jumping so
        courageously into the river, to save the life
        of your friend.</said> 
       </p>
       <p><said>O, pooh! damn it,</said> said <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>,
         <said>what signifies who pulled you out, now
         you are safe and sound? By the by, <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName>,
         did you ever quiz that <rs ref="#rx" type="person">doctor</rs>, as I desired
         you?—No, that I'm sure you didn't; but
         I think he has made a quiz of you: for,
         damme, I believe you have taken such a 
         fancy to the old quizzical fellow, that you
         can't live without him.—<persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>,
         don't you admire <persName ref="#ch">Hervey's</persName> taste?</said>
       </p>
        
        
        
        <p><said>In this instance I certainly do admire
        <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey's</persName> taste,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
