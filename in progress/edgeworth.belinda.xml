                        reading, and disposed to conduct herself
                        with prudence and integrity. Her character,
                        however, was yet to be developed
                        by circumstances.

                       had opportunities of showing her niece
                       off, as she thought, to advantage; but as
                       her health began to decline, she could not
                       go out with her as much as she wished.
                       After manœuvring with more than her
                       usual art, she succeeded in fastening <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>

                       for the season. Her ladyship was so

                                   How I have pitied and despised

                                   them playing off their unmeaning airs, vying
                                   with one another in the most <emph>obvious</emph>,
                                   and consequently the most ridiculous manner,
                                   so as to expose themselves before the
                                   very men they would attract; chattering,
                                   tittering, and flirting; full of the present
                                   moment, never reflecting upon the future;
                                   quite satisfied if theyg ot a partner at a

                                   for life. I have often asked myself, what
                                   is to become of such <rs type="persGroup">girls</rs>, when they
                                   grow old or ugly, or when the public eye
                                   grows tired of them? If they have large 
                                   fortunes, it is all very well; they can afford
                                   to divert themselves for a season or two
                                   without doubt; they are sure to be sought
                                   after and followed, not by mere danglers,

                                   more miserable than the situation of a

                                   civilities, having no home, I mean no
                                   establishment, no house &amp;c. fit for the
                                   reception of company of a certain rank.—
                                   My dearest <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, may this never be your
                                   case!—You have every possible advantage,
                                   my love: no pains have been spared 
                                   in your education, and (which is the essential
                                   point) I have taken care that this 
                                   should be known—So that you have <emph>the
                                   name</emph> of being perfectly accomplished—
                                   You will always have the name of being very
                                   fashionable, if you go much into public,
                                   as doubtless you will with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.
                                   —Your own good sense must make you
                                   
                                   
                                   aware, my dear, that from her ladyship's
                                   situation and knowledge of the world, it
                                   will always be proper, upon all subjects of
                                   conversation, for her to lead and you to
                                   follow—it would be very unfit for a young
                                   girl like you, to suffer yourself to stand in
                                   competition with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, whose
                                   high pretensions to wit and beauty are
                                   <emph>indisputable</emph>. I need say no more to you
                                   upon this subject, my dear. Even with
                                   your limited experience, you must have
                                   observed how foolish young people offend
                                   those who are the most necessary to their
                                   interests, by an imprudent indulgence of
                                   their vanity.

                                   my views—Apropos—I have no objection

                                   can afford by what one actually spends.—
                                   I know of no law, which compels a young

                 <p>It is sometimes fortunate, that the means,
                     which are taken to produce cerrtain effects
                     upon the mind, have a tendency directly
                     opposite to what is expected. <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
                     perpetual anxiety about her niece's
                     appearance, manners, and establishment,
                     had completely worn out <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> patience;
                     she had become more insensible to
                     the praises of her personal charms and accomplishments,
                     than young women of her
                     age usually are, because she had been so
                     much flattered and <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">shown off</distinct>, as it is called,
                     by her match-making aunt. Yet <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                     was fond of amusement, and had 
                     imbibed some of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> preju-
                     
                     
                     dices in favour of rank and fashion. Her
                     taste for literature declined in proportion
                     to her intercourse with the fashionable
                     world, as she did not in this society, perceive
                     the least use in the knowledge that 
                     she had acquired. Her mind had never 
                     been roused to much reflection; she had
                     in general acted but as a puppet in the
                     hands of others. To her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_00001">aunt Stanhope</persName>
                     she had hitherto paid unlimited, habitual,
                     blind obedience; but she was more free from affectation
                     and coquetry, than could have been expected,
                     after the course of documenting,
                     which she had gone through. She was 
                     charmed with the idea of her visit to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour</persName>, whom she thought the most
                     agreeable—no, that is too feeble an expression—
                     the most fascinating person she
                     had ever beheld. Such was the light in 
                     which her ladyship appeared, not only to
                     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but to all the world—that is to
                     say, all the world of fashion, and she knew
                     of no other.—The newspapers were full 
                     of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> parties, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
                     dresses, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> bon
                     mots: every thing, that her ladyship said,
                     was repeated as witty: every thing, that
                     
                     
                     
                     her ladyship wore, was imitated as fashionable.
                     Female wit sometimes depends on
                     the beauty of it's possessor, for it's reputation;
                     and the reign of beauty is proverbially
                     short, and fashion often capriciously
                     deserts her favourites, even before nature
                     withers their charms. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
                     seemed to be the fortunate exception to
                     these general rules: long after she had
                     lost the bloom of youth, she continued to
                     be admired as a fashionable <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</foreign>; and
                     long after she had ceased to be a novelty
                     in society, her company was courted by 
                     all the gay, the witty, and the gallant.
                     To be seen in public with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
                     to be a visitor at her house, were privileges,
                     of which numbers were vehemently
                     ambitious; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> was congratulated
                     and envied by all her acquaintance, for being admitted as an inmate.
                     Howe could she avoid thinking herself singularly 
                     fortunate?
                 </p>
                 <p>A short time after her arrival at <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour's</persName>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> began to see through
                     the thin veil, with which politeness covers
                     domestic misery.—Abroad, and at home,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was two different persons.
                     Abroad she appeared all life, spirit, and 
                     
                     
                     good humour—at home, listless, fretful,
                     and melancholy; she seemed like a spoiled
                     actress off the stage, over stiumlated
                     by applause, and exhausted by the exertions
                     of supporting a fictitious character.
                     —When her house was filled with well-
                     dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights,
                     and resounded with music and dancing,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in the character of the
                     mistres of the revels, shone the soul and
                     spirit of pleasure and frolic—But the moment
                     the company retired, when the
                     music ceased, and the lights were extinguishing,
                     the spell was dissolved.                     
                 </p>
                 <p>She would sometimes walk up and down 
                     the empty magnificent saloon, absorbed in
                     thoughts seemingly of the most painful 
                     nature.                     
                 </p> 
                    <p>For some days after <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> arrival in
                        town she heard nothing of <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>;
                        his lady never mentioned his name, except
                        once accidentally, as she was showing
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> the house, she said—
                        <said rend="quotes">Don't open that door—those are only

                        time <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> ever saw his lordship, he was

                        He had been early flattered with
                        the idea that he was a man of genius; and

                        dreadfully afraid of passing for a pedant,
                        that when he came into the company of
                        the idle and the ignorant, he pretended to
                        disdain every species of knowledge. His

                        lights, and according to the different 
                        situations, in which he happened to
                        be placed. He could be all things to all
                        men—and to all women—He was supposed
                        to be a favourite with the fair sex;
                        and of all his various excellences and defects,
                        there were none, on which he valued
                        himself so much as his gallantry. he
                        was not profligate; he had a strong sense
                        
                        
                        of honour, and quick feelings of humanity;
                        but he was so easily led, or rather
                        so easily excited by his companions, and
                        his companions were now of such a sort,
                        that it was probable he would soon become
                        vicious. As to his connexion with <persName ref="#ld">lady
                        Delacour</persName>, he would have started with
                        horror at the idea of disturbing the peace
                        of a family; but in her family, he said,
                        there was not peace to disturb: he was
                        vain of having it seen by the world, that
                        he was distinguished by a lady of her wit
                        and fashion, and he did not think it incumbent 
                        on him to be more scrupulous or
                        more attentive to appearance, than her
                        ladyship. By <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> jealousy
                        he was sometimes provoked, sometimes 
                        amused, and sometimes flattered. He was
                        constantly of all her ladyship's parties, in
                        public and private; consequently he saw
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> almost every day, and every day
                        he saw her with increasing admiration of
                        her beauty, and with increasing dread of
                        being taken in, to marry a niece of <quote rend="quotes">the 
                        <hi rend="italic">catch-match-maker</hi>;</quote> the name by which
                        <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> was known among the
                        <rs type="persGroup">men</rs> of his acquaintance. Young ladies,
                        who have the misfortune to be <emph>conducted</emph>
                        by these artful dames, are always supposed
                        
                        
                        
                        to be partners in all the speculations,
                        though their names may not appear in the
                        firm. If he had not been prejudiced by
                        the character of her aunt, <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
                        would have thought <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> an undesigning
                        unaffected girl; but now he suspected
                        her of artifice in every word, look, and
                        motion; and even when he felt himself
                        most charmed by her powers of pleasing,
                        he was most inclined to despise her, 
                        for what he thought such premature
                        proficiency in scientific coquetry. He
                        had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond
                        the sphere of her attraction; but
                        frequently, when he found himself within
                        it, he cursed his folly, and drew back
                        with sudden terrour. His manner towards
                        her was so variable and inconsistent, that
                        she knew not how to interpret it's language.
                        Sometimes she fancied, that with
                        all the eloquence of eyes he said, <said><emph>I
                       adore you</emph>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>;</said> at other times she
                        imagined, that his guarded silence meant
                        to warn her, that he was so entangled by
                        <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, that he could not extricate
                        himself from her snares. Whenever
                        this last idea struck her, it excited, in the
                        most edifying manner, her indignation 
                        against coquetry in general, and against
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        her ladyship's in particular: she became
                        wonderfully clear-sighted to all the improprieties
                        of her ladyship's conduct. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                        newly acquired moral sense was so 
                        much shocked, that she actually wrote
                        a full statement of her observations, and 
                        her scruples to her<persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>, concluding 
                        by a request, that she might not
                        remain under the protection of a lady,
                        whose character she could not approve,
                        and whose intimacy might prehaps be
                        injurious to her reputation, if not to her 
                        principles.                        
                    </p>
                    <p><persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> answered <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> letter
                        in a very guarded style; she rebuked
                        her niece very seveely for her imprudence in
                        mentioning <emph>names</emph> in such a manner, in a
                        letter sent by the common post; assured
                        her that her reputation was in no danger;
                        that she hoped no niece of hers would set
                        up for a prude; a character more suspected
                        by men of the world, than even
                        that of a coquette; that the <rs type="person" ref="#ld">person</rs> alluded 
                        to was a perfectly fit chaperon for
                        any young lady to appear with in public,
                        as long as she was visited by the first
                        people in town; that as to any thing in
                        the <emph>private</emph> conduct of that person, and
                        as to any <emph>private</emph> <foreign xml:lang="fr">brouillieries</foreign> between her
                        
                        
                        and her lord, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> should observe,
                        on these dangerous topics, a profound silence,
                        both in her letters and her conversation;
                        tht as long as the lady continued under
                        the protection of <rs type="person" ref="#md">her husband</rs>, the world
                        might whisper, but would not speak out;
                        that as to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> own principles,
                        she would be utterly inexcusable, if, after 
                        the education she had received, they
                        could be hurt by any bad examples; that
                        she could not be too cautious in her management 
                        of a man of <rs ref="#ch" type="person">―'s</rs> character;
                        that she could have no <emph>serious</emph> cause
                        for jealousy in the quarter she apprehended,
                        as marriage there could not be 
                        the object; and there was such a difference
                        of age, that no permanent influence
                        could probably be oobtained by the lady;
                        that the most certain method for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
                        Portman</persName> to expose herself to the ridicule 
                        of one of the parties, and to the total
                        neglect of the other, would be to betray
                        anxiety or jealousy: that, in short, if she
                        were fool enough to lose her own heart,
                        there would be little chance of her being
                        wise enough to win that of <rs ref="#ch" type="person">―</rs>, who
                        was evidently a man of gallantry rather 
                        than that of sentiment, and who was known to
                        
                        
                        
                        play his cards well, and to have good
                        luck, whenever <emph>hearts</emph> were trumps.

                    <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> fears of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, as a
                        dangerous rival, were much quieted by
                        the artful insinuations of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
                        with respect to her age, &amp;c. and in proportion
                        as her fears subsided, she blamed
                        herself for having written too harshly
                        of her ladyship's conduct. The idea that

                        friend, she ought not to propogate any
                        stories to her disadvantage, operated powerfully
                        upon <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> mind, and she reproached
                        herself for having told, even her 
                        aunt, what she had seen in private. She
                        thought that she had been guilty of treachery,
                        and she wrote again immediately to
                        <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>, to conjure her to burn her
                        last letter, to forget, if possible, it's contents,

           <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was in too much confusion,
               either to speak or think.

           <p><said>You were right to swear they were
           not love-letters,</said> pursued <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>,
           laying down the papers. <said>I protest I
           snatched them by way of frolick—I beg
           pardon. All I can do now is not to read 
           the rest.</said>               
         </p>
         <p><said>Nay—I beg—I wish—I insist upon

        <p>When <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had read it, her
            
         countenance suddenly changed—<said>Worth
         a hundred of your <rs type="person" ref="#ss">aunt's</rs>, I delcare,</said> said
         she, patting <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> cheek. <said>What a
         treasure, to meet with any thing like a <emph>new</emph> 
         heart—all hearts, nowadays, are second-
         hand at best.</said>

        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> spoke with a tone of
           feeling which <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had never heard
            from her before, and which at this moment
            touched her so much, that she took
            her ladyship's hand and kissed it.

           <p><said><hi rend="smallcaps">Where</hi> were we when all this began?</said>
            cried <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, forcing herself
            to resume an air of gayety—<said>Oh,
            masquerade was the order of the day—
            tragedy or comedy? which suits your genius 
            best, my dear?</said>
           </p>  
           <p><said>Whichever suits your ladyship's taste
           least.</said>

            <p><said>Why, my woman, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, says, I
            ought to be tragedy; and, upon the notion
            that people always succeed best when they
            take characters diametrically opposite to
            their own—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> principle—
            Perhaps you don't think that he has any 
            principles; but there you are wrong; I do
            assure you, he has sound principles—of
            taste.</said>
           </p> 
          <p><said>Of that,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, with a constrained
           smile, <said>he gives the most con-
           
           
           
           vincing proof, by his admiring your ladyship
           so much.</said>               
           </p>
           <p><said>And by his admiring <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> 
           so much more. But whilst we are making 
           speeches to one another, poor <persName ref="#marriott">Marriott</persName> is
           standing in distress like <persName ref="#david_garrick_1717">Garrick</persName>, between
           tragedy and comedy.</said>               
           </p>  
          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> opened her dressing-
              room door, and pointed to her as she stood
              with the dress of the comic muse on one
              arm, and the tragic muse on the other.              
          </p> 
          <p><said>I am afraid I have not spirits enough 
          to undertake the comic muse,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">miss
          Portman</persName>.              
          </p>
         <p><persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, who was a personage of prodigious 
           consequence, and the judge in the
           last resort at her <rs type="person" ref="#ld">mistress's</rs> toilette, looked
           extremely out of humour at having been 
           kept waiting so long; and yet more so at
           the idea that her apellant jurisdiction
           could be disputed.             
         </p> 
        <p><said>Your ladyship's taller than <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
        by half a head,</said> said <persName ref="#marriott_0001"></persName>, <said>and
        to be sure it will best become tragedy, with
        this long train; besides, I'd settled all the 
        rest of your ladyship's dress. Tragedy,
        they say, is always tall, and, no offence,
        
        
        your ladyship's taller than <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
        by half a head.</said>            
        </p> 
       <p><said>For head read inch,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
          <said>if you please.</said>           
       </p> 
       <p><said>When things are settled, one can't
       bear to have them unsettled—but your 
       ladyship must have your own way, to be
       sure—I'll say no more,</said> cried she, throwing
       down the dresses.           
       </p>
       <p><said>Stay, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           and she placed herslef between the angry
           waiting-maid and the door.           
       </p>
       <p><said>Why will you, who are the best creature
       in the world, put yourself into these
       <emph>furies</emph> about nothing—have patience with
       us, and you shall be satisfied.</said>           
       </p>   
       <p><said>That's another affair,</said> said <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>.           
       </p> 
       <p><said><persName ref="bp">Miss Portman</persName>,</said> continued <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, 
           <said>don't talk of not having spirits—
           you that are all life!—What say you,
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>?—O yes, you must be the comic
           muse; and I, it seems, must be tragedy,
           because <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> has a passion for seeing
           me <quote source="#milton_penseroso">come sweeping by.</quote> And because
           <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> must have her own way in every
           thing—she rules me with a rod of iron,
           
           
           my dear—so tragedy I needs must be—
           <emph><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> knows her power</emph>.</said>           
       </p>
       <p>There was an air of extreme vexation
           in <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> countenance, as she
           pronounced these last words, in which evidently
           more was meant than meat the ear.
           Upon many occasions <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> had
           observed, that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> exercised despotic
           authority over her mistress; and she had
           seen, with surprise, that a lady, who would
           not yield an iota of power to her <rs ref="#md" type="person">her husband</rs>,
           submitted herself to every caprice of the
           most insolent of waiting-women. For some
           time <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> imagined that this submission
           was merely an air, as she had seen
           <rs type="persGroup">some other fine ladies</rs> proud of appearing
           to be goverened by a favourite maid; but 
           she was soon convinced that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
           was in possession of some secret, which
           should for ever remain unknown. This
           idea had occurred to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> more
           than once; but never so forcibly as upon
           
           
           
           the present occasion. There had always
           been some mystery about her ladyship's
           toilette; at certain hours doors were bolted,
           and it was impossible for any body but
           <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to obtain admission. <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>
           at first imagined that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           dreaded the discovery of her cosmetic secrets,
           but her ladyship's rogue was so glaring,
           and her pearl powder was so obvious,
           that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was convinced there must be
           some other cause for this toilette secresy.
           There was a little cabinet beyond her bedchamber,
           which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> called her
           boudoir, to which there was an entrance by
           a back stair-case; but no one ever entered
           there but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>. One night, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, 
           after dancing with great spirit at a
           ball, at her own house, fainted suddenly:
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> attended her to her bed-
           chamber, but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> begged that her lady
           might be left alone with <emph>her</emph>, and she would
           by no means <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> to follow her
           into the boudoir.—All these things <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
           recollected in the space of a few seconds
           as she stood contemplating <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> and
           the dresses. The hurry of getting ready
           for the masquerade, however, dispelled
           these thoughts, and by the time she was
           
           
           dressed, the idea of what <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           would think of her appearance was uppermost
           in her mind. She was anxious to
           know, whether he would discover her in
           the character of the comic muse. <persName ref="#ld">Lady
           Delacour</persName> was discontented with her tragic
           attire, and she grew still moure out of humour
           with herself, when she saw <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.           
       </p> 
       <p><said>I protest <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> has made a perfect
       fight of me,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, as she
       got into her carriage, <said>and I'm positive
       my dress would become you a million of
       times better than your own.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> regretted that it was too
       late to change.</p>
        <p><said>Not at all too late, my dear,</said> said
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>; <said>never too late for women
         to change their minds, their dress, or their
         lovers. Seriously, you know, we are to
         call at my friend <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>—she sees
         masks too night—I'm quite intimate there;
         I'll make her let me ste up to her own 
         room, where no soul can interrupt us, and
         there we can change our dresses, and <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
         will know nothing of the matter.
         <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName> a faithful creature; and very
         fond of me; fond of power too—but who
         is not?—we must all hae our faults—one
         
         
         would not quarrel with such a good creature
         as <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> for a trifle.</said> Then suddenly
         changing her tone, she said <said>not a
         human being will find us out at the masquerade;
         for no one but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs Freke</persName> knows 
         that we are two muses. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> 
         swears he should know me in any disguise
         —but I defy him—I shall take special delight
         in puzzling him. <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> has
         told him, in confidence, that I'm to be the
         <persName ref="#widow_brady_0001">widow Brady</persName>, in man's clothes; now that's 
         to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> own character, so <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>
         will make fine confusion.</said>            
        </p>   
        <p>As soon as they got to <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> immediately
            went up stairs to exchange dresses.
            Poor <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, now she felt herself in
            spirits to undertake the comic muse, was
            rather vexed to be obliged to give up her
            becoming character; but there was no resisting 
            the polite energy of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> 
            vanity. Her ladyship ran as quick as
            lightning into a closet within the dressing-
            room, saying to <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName> woman</ecda:anonPers>,
            who attempted to follow with—<said>Can I do
            any thing for your ladyship?</said>—<said>No, No,
            no—nothing, nothing—thank ye, thank
            ye,—I want no assistance—I never let any
            
            
            
            body do any thing for me but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>;</said>
            and she bolted herself in the closet. In a
            few minutes she half opened the door,
            threw out her tragic robes, and cried,
            <said>Here, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, give me yours—
            quick—and let's see whether comedy or
            tragedy will be ready first.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Lord bless and forgive me,</said> said <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>
        woman</ecda:anonPers>, when <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
        at last threw open the door, when she was
        completely dressed—<said>but, if your la'ship
        has not been dressing all this time in that
        den, without any thing in the shape of a
        looking glass—and not to let me help! I
        that should have been so proud.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> put <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">half a guinea</ecda:commodity> into
            the <ecda:anonPers>waiting-maid's</ecda:anonPers> hand, laughed affectedly
            at her own <emph>whimsicalities</emph>, and declared,
            that she could always dress herself
            better without a glass than with one. All
            this went off admirably well with every
            body but <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>; she could not
            help thinking it extraordinary, that a person
            who was obviously fond of being waited 
            upon, would never suffer any person to
            assist her at her toilette except <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, a
            woman of whom she was evidently afraid.
            <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> quick eye saw curiosity
            
            
            painted in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> countenance, and for
            a moment she was embarrassed; but she
            soon recovered herself, and endeavoured to
            turn the course of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> thoughts,
            by whispering to her some nonsense about
            <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>—A cabalistical name,
            which she knew had the power, when
            pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> into confusion.            
        </p>
        <p>The first person they saw, when they
            went into the drawing-room at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            was this very <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who
            was not in a domino. He had laid a wager
            with <ecda:anonPers>one of his acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, that he could
            perform the part of the <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, such as
            he is seen in <persName ref="#henry_fuseli_1741">Fuseli's</persName> well known picture.
            For this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity
            in the invention and execution of
            a length of coiled skin, which he manœuvred
            with great dexterity, by means of internal
            wires; his grand difficulty had been
            to manufacture the rays that were to come
            from his eyes. He had contrived a set of
            phosphoric rays, which he was certain 
            would charm all the fair <rs type="persGroup">daughters of <persName ref="#eve_0001">Eve</persName></rs>.
            He forgot, it seems, that phosphorus could
            not well be seen by candle light. When
            he was just equipped as a <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, his rays
            
            
            set fire to part of his <mcr rend="italic">italic</mcr>, and it was
            with the greatest difficulty that he was
            extricated. He escaped unhurt, but his
            <ecda:fauna>serpent's</ecda:fauna> skin was utterly consumed; nothing
            remained, but the melancholy spectacle
            of it's skeleton. He was obliged to
            give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade,
            but he resolved to be at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            that he might meet <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and
            <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. The moment that
            the <rs type="persGroup">tragic and comic muse</rs> appeared, he 
            invoked them with much humour and 
            mock pathos, declaring that he knew not
            which of them could best sing his adventure.
            After a recital of his misfortune
            had entertained the <rs type="persGroup">company</rs>, and after
            the <rs type="persGroup">muses</rs> had performed their parts to the
            satisfaction of the audience, and their own,
            the conversation ceased to be supported in
            masquerade character; <rs type="persGroup">muses and harlequins,
            gipsies and <name>Cleopatras</name></rs>, began to talk
            of their private acfairs, and of the news
            and the scandal of the day. 
        </p>
        <p>A <rs type="persGroup">groupe of gentlemen</rs>, amongst whom 
            was <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, gathered round the
            tragic muse; as <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> had hinted
            that he knew she was a person of distinction,
            though he would not tell her name.
            
            
            He thought that he could not flatter her 
            ladyship more than by abusing <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
            After he had exercised his wit for 
            some time, without obtaining from the
            tragic muse one single syllable, he whispered,
            <said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, why this unnatural
            reserve? do you imagine, that, 
            through this tragical disguise, I have not
            found you out?</said>
        </p>
        <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#bp">tragic muse</rs>, apparently absorbed 
            in meditation, vouchsafed no reply.            
        </p>
        <p><said>The devil a word can you get for your 
        pains, <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>,</said> said a <ecda:anonPers>gentleman of his
        acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, who joined the party at this
        instant. <said>Why didn't you stick to t'<rs ref="#ld" type="person">other
        muse</rs>, who, to do her justice, is as errant
        a flirt as your heart could wish for.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>There's danger in flirting,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
            <said>with an errant flirt of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
            training. There's a kind of electricity
            about that <rs type="person" ref="#bp">girl</rs>. I have a sort of 
            cobweb feeling, an imaginary net coming
            all over me.</said>            
        </p>  
        <p><said>Fore-warned is fore-armed,</said> replied
            <ecda:anonPers>his companion</ecda:anonPers>—<said>a man must be a novice
            indeed, that could be taken in at this time
            of day by a niece of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>That <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> must be a good
        
        
        clever dame, faith,</said> said a <ecda:anonPers>third gentleman</ecda:anonPers>
         —<said>There's no less than <rs type="persGroup">six of her nieces</rs>, 
         whom she has <emph>got off</emph> within these four
         winters—Not a one of 'em now, that has
         not made a catch-match—There's the
         eldes of the set, <persName ref="#tollemache_0001">Mrs. Tollemache</persName>, what
         had she, in the devil's name, to set up 
         with in the world, but a pair of good eyes
         —Her aut, to be sure, taught her the
         use of them early enough—They might
         have rolled to all eternity, before they
         would have rolled me out of my senses;
         but you see, they did <persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache's</persName> business
         —However they are going to part
         now, I hear—<persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache</persName> was tired of her,
         before the honey-moon was over, as I
         foretold. Then there's the musical girl—
         <persName ref="#joddrell_0001">Joddrell</persName>, who has no more ear than a
         post, went and married her, because he
         had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in
         music; and <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> flattered him
         that he was one.</said>   
        </p>  
        <p>The <rs type="persGroup">gentlemen</rs> joined in the general
            laugh—The <rs type="person" ref="#bp">tragic muse</rs> sighed—
        </p>     
        <p><said>Even were she at the <title ref="#sheridan_school">School for Scandal</title>,
        the tragic muse dare not laugh, except 
        behind her mask,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence 
        Hervey</persName>.             
        </p>    
        
        
        <p><said>Far be it from her, to laugh at those
        follies which she must for ever deplore!</said>
        said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, in a feigned voice—<said>What
        miseries spring from these ill-suited marriages!
        —The victims are sacrificed, before
        they have sense enough to avoid their
        fate.</said>
        </p>
         <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> imagined, that this
        speech alluded to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> own
         marriage.             
         </p>  
        <p><said>Damn me if I know any woman,
        young or old, that would <emph>avoid</emph> being
        married, if she could, though, damn me:</said>
        cried <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName>, a gentleman who
        always supplied <quote rend="quotes" source="#pope_man">each vacuity of sense</quote>
        with an oath—<said>But damn me <persName ref="#rochefort_0001">Rochefort</persName>, 
        didn't <persName ref="#valleton_0001">Valleton</persName> marry <rs type="person" ref="#valleton_0002">one of those
        nieces</rs>?</said>
