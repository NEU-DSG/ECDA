                        had been educated chiefly in the country;

                        reading, and disposed to conduct herself
                        with prudence and integrity. Her character,
                        however, was yet to be developed
                        by circumstances.

                       had opportunities of showing her niece
                       off, as she thought, to advantage; but as
                       her health began to decline, she could not
                       go out with her as much as she wished.
                       After manœuvring with more than her
                       usual art, she succeeded in fastening <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>

                       for the season. Her ladyship was so

                                   How I have pitied and despised

                                   them playing off their unmeaning airs, vying
                                   with one another in the most <emph>obvious</emph>,
                                   and consequently the most ridiculous manner,
                                   so as to expose themselves before the
                                   very men they would attract; chattering,
                                   tittering, and flirting; full of the present
                                   moment, never reflecting upon the future;
                                   quite satisfied if theyg ot a partner at a

                                   for life. I have often asked myself, what
                                   is to become of such <rs type="persGroup">girls</rs>, when they
                                   grow old or ugly, or when the public eye
                                   grows tired of them? If they have large 
                                   fortunes, it is all very well; they can afford
                                   to divert themselves for a season or two
                                   without doubt; they are sure to be sought
                                   after and followed, not by mere danglers,

                                   to make the <emph>expected</emph> return for
                                   civilities, having no home, I mean no
                                   establishment, no house &amp;c. fit for the
                                   reception of company of a certain rank.—
                                   My dearest <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, may this never be your
                                   case!—You have every possible advantage,
                                   my love: no pains have been spared 
                                   in your education, and (which is the essential
                                   point) I have taken care that this 
                                   should be known—So that you have <emph>the
                                   name</emph> of being perfectly accomplished—
                                   You will always have the name of being very
                                   fashionable, if you go much into public,
                                   as doubtless you will with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.
                                   —Your own good sense must make you
                                   
                                   
                                   aware, my dear, that from her ladyship's
                                   situation and knowledge of the world, it
                                   will always be proper, upon all subjects of
                                   conversation, for her to lead and you to
                                   follow—it would be very unfit for a young
                                   girl like you, to suffer yourself to stand in
                                   competition with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, whose
                                   high pretensions to wit and beauty are
                                   <emph>indisputable</emph>. I need say no more to you
                                   upon this subject, my dear. Even with
                                   your limited experience, you must have
                                   observed how foolish young people offend
                                   those who are the most necessary to their
                                   interests, by an imprudent indulgence of
                                   their vanity.

                                   my views—Apropos—I have no objection
                                   to your being presented at court.

                                   can afford by what one actually spends.—
                                   I know of no law, which compels a young

                 <p>It is sometimes fortunate, that the means,
                     which are taken to produce cerrtain effects
                     upon the mind, have a tendency directly
                     opposite to what is expected. <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
                     perpetual anxiety about her niece's
                     appearance, manners, and establishment,
                     had completely worn out <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> patience;
                     she had become more insensible to
                     the praises of her personal charms and accomplishments,
                     than young women of her
                     age usually are, because she had been so
                     much flattered and <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">shown off</distinct>, as it is called,
                     by her match-making aunt. Yet <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                     was fond of amusement, and had 
                     imbibed some of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> preju-
                     
                     
                     dices in favour of rank and fashion. Her
                     taste for literature declined in proportion
                     to her intercourse with the fashionable
                     world, as she did not in this society, perceive
                     the least use in the knowledge that 
                     she had acquired. Her mind had never 
                     been roused to much reflection; she had
                     in general acted but as a puppet in the
                     hands of others. To her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_00001">aunt Stanhope</persName>
                     she had hitherto paid unlimited, habitual,
                     blind obedience; but she was more free from affectation
                     and coquetry, than could have been expected,
                     after the course of documenting,
                     which she had gone through. She was 
                     charmed with the idea of her visit to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour</persName>, whom she thought the most
                     agreeable—no, that is too feeble an expression—
                     the most fascinating person she
                     had ever beheld. Such was the light in 
                     which her ladyship appeared, not only to
                     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but to all the world—that is to
                     say, all the world of fashion, and she knew
                     of no other.—The newspapers were full 
                     of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> parties, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
                     dresses, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> bon
                     mots: every thing, that her ladyship said,
                     was repeated as witty: every thing, that
                     
                     
                     
                     her ladyship wore, was imitated as fashionable.
                     Female wit sometimes depends on
                     the beauty of it's possessor, for it's reputation;
                     and the reign of beauty is proverbially
                     short, and fashion often capriciously
                     deserts her favourites, even before nature
                     withers their charms. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
                     seemed to be the fortunate exception to
                     these general rules: long after she had
                     lost the bloom of youth, she continued to
                     be admired as a fashionable <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</foreign>; and
                     long after she had ceased to be a novelty
                     in society, her company was courted by 
                     all the gay, the witty, and the gallant.
                     To be seen in public with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
                     to be a visitor at her house, were privileges,
                     of which numbers were vehemently
                     ambitious; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> was congratulated
                     and envied by all her acquaintance, for being admitted as an inmate.
                     Howe could she avoid thinking herself singularly 
                     fortunate?
                 </p>
                 <p>A short time after her arrival at <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour's</persName>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> began to see through
                     the thin veil, with which politeness covers
                     domestic misery.—Abroad, and at home,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was two different persons.
                     Abroad she appeared all life, spirit, and 
                     
                     
                     good humour—at home, listless, fretful,
                     and melancholy; she seemed like a spoiled
                     actress off the stage, over stiumlated
                     by applause, and exhausted by the exertions
                     of supporting a fictitious character.
                     —When her house was filled with well-
                     dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights,
                     and resounded with music and dancing,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in the character of the
                     mistres of the revels, shone the soul and
                     spirit of pleasure and frolic—But the moment
                     the company retired, when the
                     music ceased, and the lights were extinguishing,
                     the spell was dissolved.                     
                 </p>
                 <p>She would sometimes walk up and down 
                     the empty magnificent saloon, absorbed in
                     thoughts seemingly of the most painful 
                     nature.                     
                 </p> 
                    <p>For some days after <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> arrival in
                        town she heard nothing of <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>;
                        his lady never mentioned his name, except
                        once accidentally, as she was showing
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> the house, she said—
                        <said rend="quotes">Don't open that door—those are only

                    <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> might have been more
                        than a pleasant young man, if he had not
                        been smitten with the desire of being
                        thought superior in every thing, and of
                        beiing the most admired person in all companies.
                        He had been early flattered with
                        the idea that he was a man of genius; and

                        to be imprudent, wild, and eccentric. He
                        affected singularity, in order to establish
                        his claim to genius. He had considerable 
                        literary talents, by which he weas distinguished
                        at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>; but he was so
                        dreadfully afraid of passing for a pedant,
                        that when he came into the company of
                        the idle and the ignorant, he pretended to
                        disdain every species of knowledge. His
                        <ecda:fauna>cameleon</ecda:fauna> character seemed to vary in different
                        lights, and according to the different 
                        situations, in which he happened to
                        be placed. He could be all things to all
                        men—and to all women—He was supposed
                        to be a favourite with the fair sex;
                        and of all his various excellences and defects,
                        there were none, on which he valued
                        himself so much as his gallantry. he
                        was not profligate; he had a strong sense
                        
                        
                        of honour, and quick feelings of humanity;
                        but he was so easily led, or rather
                        so easily excited by his companions, and
                        his companions were now of such a sort,
                        that it was probable he would soon become
                        vicious. As to his connexion with <persName ref="#ld">lady
                        Delacour</persName>, he would have started with
                        horror at the idea of disturbing the peace
                        of a family; but in her family, he said,
                        there was not peace to disturb: he was
                        vain of having it seen by the world, that
                        he was distinguished by a lady of her wit
                        and fashion, and he did not think it incumbent 
                        on him to be more scrupulous or
                        more attentive to appearance, than her
                        ladyship. By <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> jealousy
                        he was sometimes provoked, sometimes 
                        amused, and sometimes flattered. He was
                        constantly of all her ladyship's parties, in
                        public and private; consequently he saw
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> almost every day, and every day
                        he saw her with increasing admiration of
                        her beauty, and with increasing dread of
                        being taken in, to marry a niece of <quote rend="quotes">the 
                        <hi rend="italic">catch-match-maker</hi>;</quote> the name by which
                        <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> was known among the
                        <rs type="persGroup">men</rs> of his acquaintance. Young ladies,
                        who have the misfortune to be <emph>conducted</emph>
                        by these artful dames, are always supposed
                        
                        
                        
                        to be partners in all the speculations,
                        though their names may not appear in the
                        firm. If he had not been prejudiced by
                        the character of her aunt, <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>
                        would have thought <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> an undesigning
                        unaffected girl; but now he suspected
                        her of artifice in every word, look, and
                        motion; and even when he felt himself
                        most charmed by her powers of pleasing,
                        he was most inclined to despise her, 
                        for what he thought such premature
                        proficiency in scientific coquetry. He
                        had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond
                        the sphere of her attraction; but
                        frequently, when he found himself within
                        it, he cursed his folly, and drew back
                        with sudden terrour. His manner towards
                        her was so variable and inconsistent, that
                        she knew not how to interpret it's language.
                        Sometimes she fancied, that with
                        all the eloquence of eyes he said, <said><emph>I
                       adore you</emph>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>;</said> at other times she
                        imagined, that his guarded silence meant
                        to warn her, that he was so entangled by
                        <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, that he could not extricate
                        himself from her snares. Whenever
                        this last idea struck her, it excited, in the
                        most edifying manner, her indignation 
                        against coquetry in general, and against
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        her ladyship's in particular: she became
                        wonderfully clear-sighted to all the improprieties
                        of her ladyship's conduct. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                        newly acquired moral sense was so 
                        much shocked, that she actually wrote
                        a full statement of her observations, and 
                        her scruples to her<persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>, concluding 
                        by a request, that she might not
                        remain under the protection of a lady,
                        whose character she could not approve,
                        and whose intimacy might prehaps be
                        injurious to her reputation, if not to her 
                        principles.                        
                    </p>
                    <p><persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> answered <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> letter
                        in a very guarded style; she rebuked
                        her niece very seveely for her imprudence in
                        mentioning <emph>names</emph> in such a manner, in a
                        letter sent by the common post; assured
                        her that her reputation was in no danger;
                        that she hoped no niece of hers would set
                        up for a prude; a character more suspected
                        by men of the world, than even
                        that of a coquette; that the <rs type="person" ref="#ld">person</rs> alluded 
                        to was a perfectly fit chaperon for
                        any young lady to appear with in public,
                        as long as she was visited by the first
                        people in town; that as to any thing in
                        the <emph>private</emph> conduct of that person, and
                        as to any <emph>private</emph> <foreign xml:lang="fr">brouillieries</foreign> between her
                        
                        
                        and her lord, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> should observe,
                        on these dangerous topics, a profound silence,
                        both in her letters and her conversation;
                        tht as long as the lady continued under
                        the protection of <rs type="person" ref="#md">her husband</rs>, the world
                        might whisper, but would not speak out;
                        that as to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> own principles,
                        she would be utterly inexcusable, if, after 
                        the education she had received, they
                        could be hurt by any bad examples; that
                        she could not be too cautious in her management 
                        of a man of <rs ref="#ch" type="person">―'s</rs> character;
                        that she could have no <emph>serious</emph> cause
                        for jealousy in the quarter she apprehended,
                        as marriage there could not be 
                        the object; and there was such a difference
                        of age, that no permanent influence
                        could probably be oobtained by the lady;
                        that the most certain method for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
                        Portman</persName> to expose herself to the ridicule 
                        of one of the parties, and to the total
                        neglect of the other, would be to betray
                        anxiety or jealousy: that, in short, if she
                        were fool enough to lose her own heart,
                        there would be little chance of her being
                        wise enough to win that of <rs ref="#ch" type="person">―</rs>, who
                        was evidently a man of gallantry rather 
                        than that of sentiment, and who was known to
                        
                        
                        
                        play his cards well, and to have good
                        luck, whenever <emph>hearts</emph> were trumps.

                    <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> fears of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, as a
                        dangerous rival, were much quieted by
                        the artful insinuations of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
                        with respect to her age, &amp;c. and in proportion
                        as her fears subsided, she blamed
                        herself for having written too harshly
                        of her ladyship's conduct. The idea that

                        friend, she ought not to propogate any
                        stories to her disadvantage, operated powerfully
                        upon <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> mind, and she reproached
                        herself for having told, even her 
                        aunt, what she had seen in private. She
                        thought that she had been guilty of treachery,
                        and she wrote again immediately to
                        <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>, to conjure her to burn her
                        last letter, to forget, if possible, it's contents,

           laying down the papers. <said>I protest I
           snatched them by way of frolick—I beg

        <p>When <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> had read it, her
            
         countenance suddenly changed—<said>Worth
         a hundred of your <rs type="person" ref="#ss">aunt's</rs>, I delcare,</said> said
         she, patting <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> cheek. <said>What a
         treasure, to meet with any thing like a <emph>new</emph> 
         heart—all hearts, nowadays, are second-

        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> spoke with a tone of

            from her before, and which at this moment
            touched her so much, that she took

            cried <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, forcing herself
            to resume an air of gayety—<said>Oh,
            masquerade was the order of the day—
            tragedy or comedy? which suits your genius 
            best, my dear?</said>
           </p>  
           <p><said>Whichever suits your ladyship's taste

            <p><said>Why, my woman, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, says, I
            ought to be tragedy; and, upon the notion
            that people always succeed best when they
            take characters diametrically opposite to
            their own—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey's</persName> principle—
            Perhaps you don't think that he has any 
            principles; but there you are wrong; I do
            assure you, he has sound principles—of
            taste.</said>
           </p> 
          <p><said>Of that,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, with a constrained
           smile, <said>he gives the most con-
           
           
           
           vincing proof, by his admiring your ladyship
           so much.</said>               
           </p>
           <p><said>And by his admiring <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> 
           so much more. But whilst we are making 
           speeches to one another, poor <persName ref="#marriott">Marriott</persName> is
           standing in distress like <persName ref="#david_garrick_1717">Garrick</persName>, between
           tragedy and comedy.</said>               
           </p>  
          <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> opened her dressing-
              room door, and pointed to her as she stood
              with the dress of the comic muse on one
              arm, and the tragic muse on the other.              
          </p> 
          <p><said>I am afraid I have not spirits enough 
          to undertake the comic muse,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">miss

          </p>
         <p><persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, who was a personage of prodigious 
           consequence, and the judge in the
           last resort at her <rs type="person" ref="#ld">mistress's</rs> toilette, looked
           extremely out of humour at having been 
           kept waiting so long; and yet more so at
           the idea that her apellant jurisdiction
           could be disputed.             
         </p> 
        <p><said>Your ladyship's taller than <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
        by half a head,</said> said <persName ref="#marriott_0001"></persName>, <said>and
        to be sure it will best become tragedy, with
        this long train; besides, I'd settled all the 
        rest of your ladyship's dress. Tragedy,
        they say, is always tall, and, no offence,
        
        
        your ladyship's taller than <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
        by half a head.</said>            
        </p> 
       <p><said>For head read inch,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
          <said>if you please.</said>           
       </p> 
       <p><said>When things are settled, one can't
       bear to have them unsettled—but your 
       ladyship must have your own way, to be
       sure—I'll say no more,</said> cried she, throwing
       down the dresses.           
       </p>
       <p><said>Stay, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
           and she placed herslef between the angry
           waiting-maid and the door.           
       </p>
       <p><said>Why will you, who are the best creature
       in the world, put yourself into these
       <emph>furies</emph> about nothing—have patience with
       us, and you shall be satisfied.</said>           
       </p>   
       <p><said>That's another affair,</said> said <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>.           
       </p> 
       <p><said><persName ref="bp">Miss Portman</persName>,</said> continued <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, 
           <said>don't talk of not having spirits—
           you that are all life!—What say you,
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>?—O yes, you must be the comic
           muse; and I, it seems, must be tragedy,
           because <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> has a passion for seeing
           me <quote source="#milton_penseroso">come sweeping by.</quote> And because
           <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> must have her own way in every
           thing—she rules me with a rod of iron,
           
           
           my dear—so tragedy I needs must be—
           <emph><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> knows her power</emph>.</said>           
       </p>
       <p>There was an air of extreme vexation
           in <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> countenance, as she
           pronounced these last words, in which evidently
           more was meant than meat the ear.
           Upon many occasions <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> had
           observed, that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> exercised despotic
           authority over her mistress; and she had
           seen, with surprise, that a lady, who would
           not yield an iota of power to her <rs ref="#md" type="person">her husband</rs>,
           submitted herself to every caprice of the
           most insolent of waiting-women. For some
           time <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> imagined that this submission
           was merely an air, as she had seen
           <rs type="persGroup">some other fine ladies</rs> proud of appearing
           to be goverened by a favourite maid; but 
           she was soon convinced that <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
           was in possession of some secret, which
           should for ever remain unknown. This
           idea had occurred to <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> more
           than once; but never so forcibly as upon
           
           
           
           the present occasion. There had always
           been some mystery about her ladyship's
           toilette; at certain hours doors were bolted,
           and it was impossible for any body but
           <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to obtain admission. <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName>
           at first imagined that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           dreaded the discovery of her cosmetic secrets,
           but her ladyship's rogue was so glaring,
           and her pearl powder was so obvious,
           that <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was convinced there must be
           some other cause for this toilette secresy.
           There was a little cabinet beyond her bedchamber,
           which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> called her
           boudoir, to which there was an entrance by
           a back stair-case; but no one ever entered
           there but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>. One night, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, 
           after dancing with great spirit at a
           ball, at her own house, fainted suddenly:
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> attended her to her bed-
           chamber, but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> begged that her lady
           might be left alone with <emph>her</emph>, and she would
           by no means <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> to follow her
           into the boudoir.—All these things <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
           recollected in the space of a few seconds
           as she stood contemplating <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> and
           the dresses. The hurry of getting ready
           for the masquerade, however, dispelled
           these thoughts, and by the time she was
           
           
           dressed, the idea of what <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           would think of her appearance was uppermost
           in her mind. She was anxious to
           know, whether he would discover her in
           the character of the comic muse. <persName ref="#ld">Lady
           Delacour</persName> was discontented with her tragic
           attire, and she grew still moure out of humour
           with herself, when she saw <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.           
       </p> 
       <p><said>I protest <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> has made a perfect
       fight of me,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, as she
       got into her carriage, <said>and I'm positive
       my dress would become you a million of
       times better than your own.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> regretted that it was too
       late to change.</p>
        <p><said>Not at all too late, my dear,</said> said
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>; <said>never too late for women
         to change their minds, their dress, or their
         lovers. Seriously, you know, we are to
         call at my friend <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>—she sees
         masks too night—I'm quite intimate there;
         I'll make her let me ste up to her own 
         room, where no soul can interrupt us, and
         there we can change our dresses, and <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
         will know nothing of the matter.
         <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName> a faithful creature; and very
         fond of me; fond of power too—but who
         is not?—we must all hae our faults—one
         
         
         would not quarrel with such a good creature
         as <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> for a trifle.</said> Then suddenly
         changing her tone, she said <said>not a
         human being will find us out at the masquerade;
         for no one but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs Freke</persName> knows 
         that we are two muses. <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> 
         swears he should know me in any disguise
         —but I defy him—I shall take special delight
         in puzzling him. <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> has
         told him, in confidence, that I'm to be the
         <persName ref="#widow_brady_0001">widow Brady</persName>, in man's clothes; now that's 
         to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> own character, so <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>
         will make fine confusion.</said>            
        </p>   
        <p>As soon as they got to <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> immediately
            went up stairs to exchange dresses.
            Poor <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, now she felt herself in
            spirits to undertake the comic muse, was
            rather vexed to be obliged to give up her
            becoming character; but there was no resisting 
            the polite energy of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> 
            vanity. Her ladyship ran as quick as
            lightning into a closet within the dressing-
            room, saying to <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName> woman</ecda:anonPers>,
            who attempted to follow with—<said>Can I do
            any thing for your ladyship?</said>—<said>No, No,
            no—nothing, nothing—thank ye, thank
            ye,—I want no assistance—I never let any
            
            
            
            body do any thing for me but <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>;</said>
            and she bolted herself in the closet. In a
            few minutes she half opened the door,
            threw out her tragic robes, and cried,
            <said>Here, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, give me yours—
            quick—and let's see whether comedy or
            tragedy will be ready first.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Lord bless and forgive me,</said> said <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>
        woman</ecda:anonPers>, when <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
        at last threw open the door, when she was
        completely dressed—<said>but, if your la'ship
        has not been dressing all this time in that
        den, without any thing in the shape of a
        looking glass—and not to let me help! I
        that should have been so proud.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> put <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">half a guinea</ecda:commodity> into
            the <ecda:anonPers>waiting-maid's</ecda:anonPers> hand, laughed affectedly
            at her own <emph>whimsicalities</emph>, and declared,
            that she could always dress herself
            better without a glass than with one. All
            this went off admirably well with every
            body but <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>; she could not
            help thinking it extraordinary, that a person
            who was obviously fond of being waited 
            upon, would never suffer any person to
            assist her at her toilette except <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, a
            woman of whom she was evidently afraid.
            <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> quick eye saw curiosity
            
            
            painted in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> countenance, and for
            a moment she was embarrassed; but she
            soon recovered herself, and endeavoured to
            turn the course of <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman's</persName> thoughts,
            by whispering to her some nonsense about
            <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>—A cabalistical name,
            which she knew had the power, when
            pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> into confusion.            
        </p>
        <p>The first person they saw, when they
            went into the drawing-room at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            was this very <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who
            was not in a domino. He had laid a wager
            with <ecda:anonPers>one of his acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, that he could
            perform the part of the <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, such as
            he is seen in <persName ref="#henry_fuseli_1741">Fuseli's</persName> well known picture.
            For this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity
            in the invention and execution of
            a length of coiled skin, which he manœuvred
            with great dexterity, by means of internal
            wires; his grand difficulty had been
            to manufacture the rays that were to come
            from his eyes. He had contrived a set of
            phosphoric rays, which he was certain 
            would charm all the fair <rs type="persGroup">daughters of <persName ref="#eve_0001">Eve</persName></rs>.
            He forgot, it seems, that phosphorus could
            not well be seen by candle light. When
            he was just equipped as a <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, his rays
            
            
            set fire to part of his <mcr rend="italic">italic</mcr>, and it was
            with the greatest difficulty that he was
            extricated. He escaped unhurt, but his
            <ecda:fauna>serpent's</ecda:fauna> skin was utterly consumed; nothing
            remained, but the melancholy spectacle
            of it's skeleton. He was obliged to
            give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade,
            but he resolved to be at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            that he might meet <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and
            <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>. The moment that
            the <rs type="persGroup">tragic and comic muse</rs> appeared, he 
            invoked them with much humour and 
            mock pathos, declaring that he knew not
            which of them could best sing his adventure.
            After a recital of his misfortune
            had entertained the <rs type="persGroup">company</rs>, and after
            the <rs type="persGroup">muses</rs> had performed their parts to the
            satisfaction of the audience, and their own,
            the conversation ceased to be supported in
            masquerade character; <rs type="persGroup">muses and harlequins,
            gipsies and <name>Cleopatras</name></rs>, began to talk
            of their private acfairs, and of the news
            and the scandal of the day. 
        </p>
        <p>A <rs type="persGroup">groupe of gentlemen</rs>, amongst whom 
            was <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, gathered round the
            tragic muse; as <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> had hinted
            that he knew she was a person of distinction,
            though he would not tell her name.
            
            
            He thought that he could not flatter her 
            ladyship more than by abusing <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
            After he had exercised his wit for 
            some time, without obtaining from the
            tragic muse one single syllable, he whispered,
            <said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, why this unnatural
            reserve? do you imagine, that, 
            through this tragical disguise, I have not
            found you out?</said>
        </p>
        <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#bp">tragic muse</rs>, apparently absorbed 
            in meditation, vouchsafed no reply.            
        </p>
        <p><said>The devil a word can you get for your 
        pains, <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>,</said> said a <ecda:anonPers>gentleman of his
        acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, who joined the party at this
        instant. <said>Why didn't you stick to t'<rs ref="#ld" type="person">other
        muse</rs>, who, to do her justice, is as errant
        a flirt as your heart could wish for.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>There's danger in flirting,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>,
            <said>with an errant flirt of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
            training. There's a kind of electricity
            about that <rs type="person" ref="#bp">girl</rs>. I have a sort of 
            cobweb feeling, an imaginary net coming
            all over me.</said>            
        </p>  
        <p><said>Fore-warned is fore-armed,</said> replied
            <ecda:anonPers>his companion</ecda:anonPers>—<said>a man must be a novice
            indeed, that could be taken in at this time
            of day by a niece of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>That <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> must be a good
        
        
        clever dame, faith,</said> said a <ecda:anonPers>third gentleman</ecda:anonPers>
         —<said>There's no less than <rs type="persGroup">six of her nieces</rs>, 
         whom she has <emph>got off</emph> within these four
         winters—Not a one of 'em now, that has
         not made a catch-match—There's the
         eldes of the set, <persName ref="#tollemache_0001">Mrs. Tollemache</persName>, what
         had she, in the devil's name, to set up 
         with in the world, but a pair of good eyes
         —Her aut, to be sure, taught her the
         use of them early enough—They might
         have rolled to all eternity, before they
         would have rolled me out of my senses;
         but you see, they did <persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache's</persName> business
         —However they are going to part
         now, I hear—<persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache</persName> was tired of her,
         before the honey-moon was over, as I
         foretold. Then there's the musical girl—
         <persName ref="#joddrell_0001">Joddrell</persName>, who has no more ear than a
         post, went and married her, because he
         had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in
         music; and <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> flattered him
         that he was one.</said>   
        </p>  
        <p>The <rs type="persGroup">gentlemen</rs> joined in the general
            laugh—The <rs type="person" ref="#bp">tragic muse</rs> sighed—
        </p>     
        <p><said>Even were she at the <title ref="#sheridan_school">School for Scandal</title>,
        the tragic muse dare not laugh, except 
        behind her mask,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence 
        Hervey</persName>.             
        </p>    
        
        
        <p><said>Far be it from her, to laugh at those
        follies which she must for ever deplore!</said>
        said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, in a feigned voice—<said>What
        miseries spring from these ill-suited marriages!
        —The victims are sacrificed, before
        they have sense enough to avoid their
        fate.</said>
        </p>
         <p><persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> imagined, that this
        speech alluded to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> own
         marriage.             
         </p>  
        <p><said>Damn me if I know any woman,
        young or old, that would <emph>avoid</emph> being
        married, if she could, though, damn me:</said>
        cried <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName>, a gentleman who
        always supplied <quote rend="quotes" source="#pope_man">each vacuity of sense</quote>
        with an oath—<said>But damn me <persName ref="#rochefort_0001">Rochefort</persName>, 
        didn't <persName ref="#valleton_0001">Valleton</persName> marry <rs type="person" ref="#valleton_0002">one of those
        nieces</rs>?</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>Yes: she was a mighty fine dancer,
            and had good legs enough: <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
            got poor <persName ref="#valleton_0001">Valleton</persName> to fight a duel
            about her place in a country dance, and
            then he was so pleased with himself for
            his prowess, that he married the girl.</said>
        </p>
         <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> made an effort to change her
             seat, but she was encompassed so, that 
             she could not retreat.             
         </p> 
         <p><said>As to <persName ref="#jenny_mason_0001">Jenny Mason</persName>, the fifth of <emph>the
         
         
         nieces</emph>,</said> continued the <ecda:anonPers>witty gentleman</ecda:anonPers>,
         <said>she was as brown as mahogany, and
         she had neither eyes, nose, mouth, nor legs:
         what <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> could do with her I
         often wondered; but she took courage,
         <emph>rouged</emph> her up, set her going as a <emph>dasher</emph>,
         and she dashed herself into <persName ref="#tom_levit_0001">Tom Levit's</persName> 
         curricle, and <persName ref="#tom_levit_0001">Tom</persName> couldn't get her out
         again, till she was the honourable <persName ref="#jenny_mason_0001">Mrs.

         own hands, and I hear, she's driving him
         and herself <emph>the road to ruin</emph>, as fast as
         they can gallop. As for this <persName ref="#bp">Belinda
         Portman</persName> 'twas a good hit to send her
         to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>; but I take it, she
         hangs upon hands; for last winter, when
         I was at <placeName>Bath</placeName>, she was hawked about
         every where, and the aunt was puffing
         her with might and main. You heard 
         of nothing, wherever you went, but of 
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName>, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman's</persName>
         accomplishments—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName>, and 
         her accomplishments, I'll swear, were as
         well advertised, as <ecda:commodity ana="#sale"><persName ref="#packwood_0001">Packwood's</persName> razor

             <!-- try and find three missing pages here, or add a <gap> -->
         </p>    
        
        
        
        <p><said>A good bold <name>Stanhope</name> cast of the net,
        faith,</said> whispered <ecda:anonPers>one of his companions</ecda:anonPers>
        —<said><rs type="person" ref="#bp"><persName ref="#melpomene">Melpomene</persName></rs>, has thou forgot thyself
        to marble?</said> pursued <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—
        <said>I am not veyr well,</said> whispered <persName ref="#bp">miss
        Portman</persName> to her ladyship—<said>could we get
        away?</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Get away from <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, do
        you mean?</said> replied her ladyship, in a
        whisper—<said>'tis not easy, but we'll try
        what can be done, if it's necessary.</said>—            
        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had no power to reply to this
          raillery, indeed she scarcely heard the
          words that were said to her; but she put
          her arm within <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>, who, to
          her great relief, had the good nature to
          leave the room with her immediately.—
          Her ladyship, though she would sacrifice
          the feelings of others, without compunction
          to her vanity, whenever the power of 
          her wit was disputed; yet towards those
          by whom it was acknowledged, she showed
          some mercy.            
        </p>     
        <p><said>What is the matter with the child?</said>
          said she as she went down the staircase.  
        </p>     
        <p><said>Nothing, if I could have air,</said> said
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. There was a crowd of <rs type="persGroup">servants</rs>
            in the hall.            
        </p>     
        
        
        <p><said>Why does <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> avoid me so
        pertinaciously? What crime have I committed,
        that I was not favoured with one
        word,</said> said <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who had
        followed them down stairs, and overtook 
        them in the hall.           
        </p>
        <p><said>Do see, if you can find any of my 
        people,</said> cried <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.            
        </p>     
       <p><said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> the comic muse!</said>
           exclaimed <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>—<said>I thought,</said>—
       </p>      
       <p><said>No matter what you thought,</said> interrupted
       <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>—<said>Let my carriage
       draw up, for here's a young friend of 
       yours trembling so about <emph>nothing</emph>, that I
       am half afraid she will faint; and you 
       know it would not be so pleasant to faint
       here amongst footmen—Stay! this upper
       room is empty—O, I did not mean to
       tell <emph>you</emph> to stay,</said> said she <persName ref="#ch">Hervey</persName>, who
       involuntarily followed her in the utmost
       consternation.           
       </p>      
       <p><said>I am perfectly well, now—perfectly
       well,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.           
       </p>      
       <p><said>Perfectly a simpleton, I think,</said> said
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—Nay, my dear, you
           must be ruled, your mask must come off;
           didn't you tell me you wanted air—What
           now! This is not the first time <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
           Hervey</persName> has ever seen your face without a
           
           
           mask, is it? It's the first time indeed he,
           or any body else, ever saw it of such a
           colour, I believe.           
       </p>      
       <p>When <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> pulled off <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
           mask, her face was, during the first instant,
           pale; the next moment, crimsoned
           over with a burning blush.—
       </p>      
        <p><said>What is the matter with ye both?—
        How he stands!</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
         turning to <persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName>—<said>Did you never
         see a woman blush before?—or did you 
         never say or do any thing to make a woman
         blush before?—Will you give <persName ref="#bp">miss
         Portman</persName> a glass of <ecda:food>water</ecda:food>?—there's some
         behind you on that sideboard, man!—
         but he has neither eyes, ears, nor understanding—
         Do go about your business,</said>
         said her ladyship, pushing him towards
         the door—<said>Do go about your business,
         for I have'nt common patience with you
         —on my conscience, I believe the man's
         in love—and not with me!—There's
         <ecda:commodity ana="#medical #use">sal-volatile</ecda:commodity> for you, child,</said> continued she
         to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>. <said>O, you can walk now—
         but remember you're on slippery ground
         —remember <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> is not a

         woman.</said>
        </p> 
         <p><said>It is perfectly indifferent to me,
         
         
         
         madam,</said> <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> said, with a voice and 
         look of proud indignation.             
         </p> 
         <p><said><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, your carriage has

             to the door, but without entering.             
         </p>  
         <p><said>Then put this <quote>perfectly well,</quote> and

          <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
         </p>    
         <p>He obeyed without uttering a syllable.</p>    
         <p><said>Dumb! Absolutely dumb: I protest,</said>
           said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, as he handed
           her in afterwards. <said>Why, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>, the
           casting of your <ecda:fauna>serpent's</ecda:fauna> skin seems to
           have quite changed your nature—nothing
           but the simplicity of the <ecda:fauna>dove</ecda:fauna> left; and I
           expect to hear you cooing presently—
           don't you, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>?</said> she ordered
           the <ecda:anonPers>coachman</ecda:anonPers> to drive to the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>.
         </p>    
        <p><said>To the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>! I was in hopes
        your ladyship would have the goodness 
        to set me down at home; for indeed I
        shall be a burden to you, and every body 
        else at the masquerade.</said>             
        </p>     
        <p><said>If you have made any appointment

        square</placeName>, I'll set you down certainly, if you
        insist upon it, my dear; for punctuality
        is a virtue—but prudence is a virtue too,
        
        
        in a young lady; who, as your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>
        would say, has to <emph>establish</emph> herself in
        the world.—Why these tears, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>?
        —Or are they tears? for by the light of
        the lamps I can scarcely tell; though I'll
        swear I saw the handkerchief at the eyes
        —What is the meanining of all this? You'd 
        best trust me; for I knowa s much of 
        men and manners, as your <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope</persName>
        at least; and in one word, you have nothing 
        to fear from me, and every thing to hope
        for yourself; if you will only dry up
        your tears, <emph>keep on your mask</emph>, and take
        my advice; you'll find it as good as your
        <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope's</persName>.</said>
        </p>     
        <p><said>My <persName ref="#ss">aunt Stanhope's</persName>! O,</said> cried <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
           <said>never, never more will I take

           myself to be insulted as a female adventurer
           —Little did I know in what a light

           <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—<said>Lord, my dear, you
           must either give up living in the world, or
           expect to hear yourself, and your <rs type="persGroup">aunts</rs>, 
           and your <rs type="persGroup">cousins</rs>, and your <rs type="persGroup">friends</rs>, from
           generation to generation, abused every 
           hour in the day, by <rs type="persGroup">their friends, and your
           friends</rs>—'tis the common course of things.
           Now you know what a multitude of obedient humble servants, dear creatures, and
           very sincere and most affectionate friends,
           I have, in my writing desk, and on my 
           mantle piece, not to mention the cards 
           which crowd the common rack from intimate
           acquaintance; who cannot live without
           the honour, or favour, or pleasure, of
           seeing <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> twice a week—do
           you think I'm fool enough to care the hundredth part of a
           straw, if I were this minute thrown into
           the <placeName>Red</placeName>, or the <placeName>Black sea</placeName>!—No, I have
           not one <emph>real</emph> friend in the world, except
           
           
           
           <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>—yet, you see, I am the
           comic muse, and I mean to keep it up—
           keep it up to the last—on purpose to provoke
           those, who would give their eyes to 
           be able to pity me—I humbly thank them,
           no pity for <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—Follow my example,
           <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>; elbow your way through
           the crowd, if you stop to be civil and
           beg pardon and, <said><quote rend="italic"><distinct type="dialect">hope I did'nt hurt ye</distinct>,</quote></said>
           you will be trod under foot.—Now you'll 
           meet those <rs type="persGroup">young men</rs> continually, who
           took the liberty of laughing at your <rs type="person" ref="#ss">aunt</rs>,
           and your <rs type="persGroup">cousins</rs>, and yourself, they are
           <rs type="persGroup">men of fashion</rs>—Show them you've no
           feeling, and they'll acknowledge you for 
           a woman of fashion—you'll marry better
           than any of your cousins, <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           if you can; and then it will be your turn
           to laugh about nets and cages—As to love
           and all that—</said>
       </p>      
        <p>The carriage stopped at the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>,
            just as <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs> came to the words
            <quote><said>love and all that,</said></quote>—her thoughts took a
            different turn, and during the remainder
            of the night she exhibited, in such a manner
            as to attract universal admiration,
            all the ease, and grace, and gayety, of <persName ref="#euphrosyne">Euphrosyne</persName>.           
        </p>     
          
          
          
        <p>To <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> the night appeared long
            and dull; the common place wit of <rs type="persGroup">chimney-
            sweepers and gipsies</rs>; the antics of
            <rs type="persGroup">harlequins</rs>; the graces of <rs type="persGroup">flower-girls</rs> and
            <name>Cleopatras</name> had not power to amuse her;
            for her thoughts still recurred to that conversation
            which had given her so much
            pain—a pain which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> raillery
            had failed to obliterate.            
        </p> 
        <p><said>How happy you are, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
           said she, when they got into the carriage
           to go home—<said>How happy you are to
           have such an amazing flow of spirits!</said>—
        </p>   
        <p><said>Amazing you might well say, if you
        knew all,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—and she
         heaved a deep sigh, threw herself back
         in the carriage, let fall her mask, and was 
         silent—It was broad day-light, and <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>
         had a full view of her countenance,
         which was the picture of despair—She
         uttered not one syllable more, nor had
         <persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> the courage to interrupt her
         meditations, till they came within sight
         of <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>; when <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> ventured
         to remind her, that she had resolved
         to stop there, and change dresses before
         <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> saw them.
        </p>     
         <p><said>No, it's no matter,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Dela-
         
         
         
         cour</persName>—<said><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> will leave me at the 
         last, like all the rest—'tis no matter.</said>—
         Her ladyship sunk back into her former
         attitude; but after she had remained silent
         for some moments, she started up and 
         exclaimed—
         </p>  
        <p><said><seg xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002"><quote source="#shakespeare_henry_viii">If I had served myself, with half the 
        zeal that I have served the world, I should
        not now be thus forsaken!</quote>—I have sacrificed 
        reputation, happiness, every thing,
        for the love of frolic—All frolic will soon
        be at an end with me—I am dying—and
        I shall die unlamented by any human being.
        —If I were to live my life over again,
        what a different life it should be!—What 
        a different person <emph>I would be</emph>!*</seg> But it is
        all over now—I am dying.</said>            
        </p>   
        <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> astonishment at these words,
         and at the solemn manner in which they
         were pronounced, was inexpressible; she
         gazed at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, and then repeated
         the word <said><quote>dying</quote>!</said>—<said>Yes, dying,</said> said
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>.           
        </p> 
        <p><said>But you seem to me, and to all the 
         world, in perfect health; and but half an 
        hour ago in perfect spirits,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.</p>
             
        
        <p><said>I seem to you, and to all the world,
        what I am not—I tell you I am dying,</said>
        said <rs type="person" ref="#ld">her ladyship</rs>, in an emphatic tone.
        </p>
        <p>Not a word more passed, till they got
         home. <persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> hurried up stairs,
         bidding <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> follow her to her dressing-
         room. <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> was lighting the six
         wax candles on the dressing-table—<said>As I
         live, they have changed dresses after all,</said>
         said <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> to herself, as she fixed her
         eyes upon <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.
         <said>I'll be burnt, if I don't make my 
         lady remember this.</said>            
        </p> 
       <p><said><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, you need not wait; I'll
       ring when I want you,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
        and taking one of the candles from 
        the table, she pressed on hastily with
        <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, through her dressing-room,
        through her bedchamber, and to the door
        of the mysterious cabinet.           
       </p>  
      <p><said><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, the key of this door,</said> cried
        she, impatiently, after she had, in vain,
        attempted to open it.           
       </p>      
       <p><said>Heavenly graciousness!</said>, cried <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,
       <said>is my lady out of her senses?</said>
       </p>   
        <p><said>The key—the key—quick, the key,</said>
         repeated <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, in a peremptory
         tone, she seized it as soon as <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>
          
          
          
          drew it from her pocket, and unlocked the
          door. 
        </p>     
        <p><said>Had I not best put <emph>the things</emph> to
        rights, my lady?</said> said <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, catching
         fast hold of the opening door.            
        </p>     
        <p><said>I'll ring when you are wanted, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said>
         said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>; and pushing
         open the door with violence, she rushed
         forward to the middle of the room, and
         turning back she beckoned to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> to
         follow her—<said>Come in, what is it you are
         afraid of?</said> said she.—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> went on,
         and the moment she was in the room,
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> shut and locked the door.
          The room was rather dark, as there was no 
          light in it, except what came from the
          candle, which <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> held in her
          hand, and which burned but dimly.—
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, as she looked round, saw nothing
          but a confusion of linen rags—vials, some 
          empty, some full, and she perceived that
          there was a strong smell of medicines.
        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName>, whose motions were all
        precipitate, like those of a person whose
        mind is in great agitation, looked from 
        side to side of the room, without seeming
        to know what she was in search of. She 
        then, with a species of fury, wiped the
        
        
        paint from her face, and returning to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,
        held the candle so as to throw the
        light full upon her livid features. Her
        eyes were sunk, her cheeks hollow—no
        trace of youth or beauty remained on her
        death-like countenance, which formed a
        horrid contrast with her gay fantastic dress.
        </p>     
       <p><said>You are shocked, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,</said>, said she,
         <said>but as yet you have seen nothing—look
         here,—</said> and baring one half of her bosom,
         she revealed a hideous spectacle.           
       </p>      
       <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> sunk back into a chair—<persName ref="#ld">lady
       Delacour</persName> flung herself on her knees before
       her.          
       </p>      
        <p><said>Am I humbled, am I wretched enough?</said>
         cried she, her voice trembling with agony
         —<said>Yes, pity me, for what you have seen;
         and a thousand times more—my mind is eaten away
         like my body, by incurable disease—inveterate
         remores—remorse for a life of folly
         —of folly which has brought on me all
         the punishments of guilt.</said>
        </p>     
        <p><said><rs ref="#md" type="person">My husband</rs>,</said> continued she, and
          her voice suddenly altered from the tone
          of grief to that of anger—<said>My husaband
          hates me—no matter—I despise him—<rs type="persGroup">His
          relations</rs> hate me—no matter—I despise
          
          
          
          them—<rs type="persGroup">My own relations</rs> hate me—no
          matter, I never wish to see them more—
          never shall they see my sorrow—never
          shall they hear a complaint, a sigh from
          me. There is no torture which I could
          not more easily endure than their insulting
          pity. I will die, as I have lived, the envy
          and admiration of the world. When I
          am gone, let them find out their mistake;
          and moralise, if they wil, over my grave.</said>
          —She paused—<persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> had no power to
           speak.
        </p>     
        <p><said>Promise, swear to me,</said> resumed <persName ref="#ld">lady
        Delacour</persName> vehemently, seizing <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
        hand, <said>that you will never reveal to any
        mortal what you have seen and heard this 
        night. No living creature suspects that
        <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> is dying by inches, except
        <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>, and that woman, who but a 
        few hours ago I thought my <emph>real friend</emph>,
        to whom I trusted every secret of my life,
        every thought of my hear.—Fool! idiot!
        Dupe that I was to trust to the friendship
        of a woman, whom I knew to be without 
        principle—but I thought she had honour;
        I thought she could never betray <emph>me</emph>—O
        <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>! <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>! you to desert me!—
        Any thing else I could have borne—but
        
        
        
        you who I thought would have supported
        me in the tortures of mind and body which
        I am to go through—you, that I thought
        would receive my last breath—you to desert
        me!—Now I am alone in the world—
        left to the mercy of an insolent waiting-
        woman.</said>            
        </p>     
        <p><persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour</persName> hid her face on <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName>
          lap, and almost stifled by the violence of
          contending emotions, she at last gave vent
          to them, and sobbed aloud.
        </p>     
        <p><said>Trust to one,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, pressing
            her hand with all the tenderness which
            humanity could dictate, <said>who will never
            leave you at the mercy of an insolent waiting
            woman—trust to me.</said>            
        </p>     
        <p><said>Trust to you,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,
            looking up eagerly in <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> face;
            <said>Yes—I think—I may trust to you—for
            though a niece of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>, I have
            seen this day, and have seen with surprise
            symptoms of artless feeling about you.
            This was what tempted me to open my
            mind to you, when I found that I had lost
            the only friend—but I will think no more 
            of that—if you have a heart, you must 
            feel for me—Leave me now—to-morrow
            you shall hear my whole history—now I
            
            
            am quite exhausted—ring for <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>.</said>—
            <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> appeared with a face of constrained
            civility, and latent rage.—<said>Put me to
            bed, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, with a
            subdued voice—<said>but first light <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> 
            to her room—she need not—yet—see
            the horrid business of my toilette.</said>            
        </p>  
        <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, when she was left alone, immediately
            opened her shutters, and threw
            up the sash to refresh herself with the
            morning air. She felt excessively fatigued,
            and in the hurry of her mind, she could
            not think of any thing distinctly. She 
            took off her masquerade dress, and went
            to bed, in hopes of forgetting, for a few
            hours, what she felt indelibly impressed
            upon her imagination. But it was in vain
            that she endeavoured to compose herself
            to sleep; her ideas were in too great and
            painful confusion. For some time, whenever
            she closed her eyes, the face and form
            of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, such as she had just
            beheld them, seemed to haunt her; afterwards, 
            the idea of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and
            the painful recollection of the conversation
            she had overheard, recurred to her; the
            words, <said><quote>do you think I don't know that
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName> is a composition of arti-
            
            
            
            fice and affectation</quote>,</said> were fixed in her 
            memory. She recollected with the utmost 
            minuteness every look of contempt, which
            she had seen in the faces of the <rs type="persGroup">young
            men</rs>, whilst they spoke of <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
            the match-maker. <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> mind, however,
            was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect:
            she seemed only to live over again
            the preceding night. At last the strange
            motley figures whish she had seen at the
            masquerade flitted before her eyes, and she
            sunk into an uneasy slumber.

         <p><persName ref="#bp">Miss Portman</persName> was awakened by the
         ringing of <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> bedchamber
         bell. She opened her eyes with the confused
         idea that something disagreeable had
         happened; and before she had distinctly
         recollected herself, <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> came to her
         bedside, with a note from <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—
         It was written with a pencil.

            then we shall have the evening to ourselves
            —I have much to say, as people usually

          </p>   
          <p>I have taken a double dose of opium,
          and am not so horribly out of spirits as I 
          
          
          
          was last night—so you need not be afraid

          leave this world—this by the by, I don't
          upon second thoughts, which are always
          best, mean to do yet.—There certainly
          were such people as <name>Amazons</name>—I hope you

         <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> obeyed the summons to her
           ladyship's dressing-room: she found <persName ref="#ld">lady
           Delacour</persName> with her face completely repaired
           with paint, and her spirits with opium.
           She was in high consultation with <persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName>  
            and <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName>, the milliner, about
             
             
             
          the <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #production">crape petticoat of her birthnight dress</ecda:commodity>
          which was extended over a large hoop in
          full state. <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> descanted long
          and learnedly upon festoons and loops,
          knots and fringes, submitting all the time
          every thing to her ladyship's better judgement.
         </p>    
         <p><persName ref="#m">Marriott</persName> was sulky and silent. She
             opened her lips but once upon the question of <ecda:flora>laburnum</ecda:flora>, or no<ecda:flora>laburnum flowers</ecda:flora>.
         </p>    
         <p>Against them she quoted the memoirs
             and authority of the celebrated <persName ref="#george_bellamy_1727">Mrs. Bellamy</persName>,

             that the milliner's imagination, now that

             led to the vulgar idea of <distinct rend="quotes" type="economic">ready money</distinct>, suddenly

             <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> had left the room—<said>absolutely
             written a <emph>twisted</emph> note to <persName ref="#ch">Clarence
             Hervey</persName>, my dear—but why did I tell you 
             that? Now your head will run upon the

         </p>    
         <p>After dinner, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, having
             made <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> protest and blush, and blush
             and protest, that her head was not running 
             upon the twisted note, began the history
             of her life and opinions in the following 
             manner.             
         </p>    
         <said xml:id="s008" next="#s009"><p>I do nothing by halves, my dear—I

             Blas</persName> told his to the <ecda:anonPers>archbishop of <placeName>Grenada</placeName></ecda:anonPers>
             —skipping over the <emph>useful</emph> passages—because
             you are not an archbishop, and I
             should not have the grace to put on a
             sanctified face, if you were.—I am no hypocrite,
             and have nothing worse than folly
             to conceal—That's bad enough—for a
             
             
             
             
             woman who is known to play the fool, is
             always suspected of playing the devil—
             But I begin wehre I ought to end, with 
             my moral, which I dare say you are not
             impatient to anticipate—I never read or
             listened to a moral at the end of a story in
             my life—manners for me, and morals for
             those that like them.—My dear, you will
             be wofully disappointed, if in my story
             you expect any thing like a novel. I once
             heard a general say, that nothing was less
             like a review than a battle; and I can tell
             you, that nothing is more unlike a novel
             than real life. Of all lives, mine has been
             the least romantic. No love in it, but a
             great deal of hate. I was a rich heiress—I
             had, I believe, a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">hundred thousand pounds,
             or more</ecda:commodity>; and twice as many caprices—I
             was handsome and witty—or, to speak
             with that kind of circumlocution which
             is called humility, the world, the partial
             world, thought me a beauty, and a bel-
             esprit.—Having told you my fortune, need
             I add, that I, or it, had <rs type="persGroup">lovers</rs> in abundance
             —of all sorts and degrees—not to reckon
             those, it may be presumed, who died of
             concealed passions for me. I had sixteen
             declarations and proposals in form—then
             
             
             what in the name of wonder, or of common
             sense, which by the by is the greatest 
             of wonders—what in the name of common 
             sense made me marry <persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour</persName>?—
             Why, my dear, you,—no not <emph>you</emph>, but any
             girl who is not used to have a parcel of
             admirers, would think it the easiest thing
             in the world to make her choice; but let
             her judge by what she feels when a dexterous
             mercer or linen-draper produces pretty
             thing after pretty thing—and this is so
             becoming, and that will wear for ever—
             as he swears; but then that's so fashionable
             —the novice stands in a charming perplexity,
             and after examining, and doubting,
             and tossing over half the <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">goods</ecda:commodity> in the
             shop, it's ten to one, when it begins to get late,
             the young lady, in a hurry, pitches
             upon the very ugliest and worst thing that
             she has seen. Just so it was with me and
             my <rs type="persGroup">lovers</rs>, and just so—

          <p>
             <quote rend="quotes" source="#williams_collins">Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,</quote>
             I pitched upon <persName ref="#md">viscount Delacour</persName>, for my
             lord and judge. He had just at that time
             lost at <placeName>Newmarket</placeName> more than he was
             worth in every sense of the word; and my
             fortune was the most convenient thing in
             <!-- pages 64 and 65 missing -->
             
             
             I thought I should in time break him in.
             —From the specimens you have seen, you
             may guess that I was even then a tolerable
             proficient in the dear art of <mcr rend="italic">self-justification</mcr>
             —I had almost gained my point, just
             broken my lord's heart, when one fair
             morning, I unluckily told his man
             <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, that he knew no more how
             to cut hair than a sheepshearer.—<persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>,
             who is conceit personified, took mortal
             offence at this; and the devil, who is
             always at hand to turn anger into malice,
             put it into <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort's</persName> head, to put it
             into my lord's head, that the world thought
             —<quote rend="italic"><said direct="false">My lady governed him</said></quote>. My lord
             took fire—They say the <ecda:fauna>torpedo</ecda:fauna>, the 
             coldest of cold creatures, sometimes gives
             out a spark—I suppose, when electrified
             with anger.—The next time that innocent
             I insisted upon my <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> doing
             or not doing—I forget which—the most
             reasonable thing in the world, my lord
             turns short round, and answers—<said>My
             <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, I am not a man to be governed
             by a wife</said>—And from that time 
             to this, the words <quote>I am not a man to be 
             governed by a wife</quote>—have been written
             in his obstinate face, as all the world who
             
             
             
             can read the human countenance may 
             see.—My dear I laugh, but even in the
             midst of laughter there is sadness.—But
             you don't know what it is—I hope you
             never may—to have an obstinate fool for
             a bosom fiend.</p>
             <p>I at first flattered myself, that <rs type="person" ref="#md">my
             lord's</rs> was not an inveterate, incurable malady:
             but from his obvious weakness, I
             might have seen that there was no hope;
             for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous
             in proportion to the weakness of the
             patient.—My lord's case was desperate.—
             Kill or cure, was my humane or prudent
             maxim.—I determined to try the <seg ana="#poison">poison 
             of jealousy</seg>, by way of an alternative.—I 
             had long kept it in petto as my ultimate 
             remedy. I fixed upon a proper subject—
             a man with whom I thought that I could
             coquette to all eternity, without any danger
             to myself—a certain <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>—
             as empty a coxcomb as you would wish to
             see.—The world, said I to myself, can
             never be so absurd to suspect <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
             with such a man as this, though
             her lord may, and will, for nothing is too 
             absured for him to believe.—Half my theory
             proved just—that is saying a great deal
             
             
             
             for any theory. My lord swallowed the 
             remedy that I had prepared for him, with
             an avidity, and a bonhommie, which it did
             me good to behold—my remedy operated
             beyond my most sanguine expectations.—
             The poor man was cured of his obstinacy,
             and became stark mad with jealousy.—
             THen indeed I had some hopes of him;
             for a madman can be managed, a fool cannot.
             In a month's time, I made him
             quite docile. With a face longer than the
             <rs type="person" ref="#heraclitus_535">weeping philosopher's</rs>, he came to me one
             morning, and assured me, <said direct="false">he would do
             every thing I pleased, provided I would
             consult my own honour, and his, and give
             up <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>.</said></p>
            
            
            
             <p><quote><said>Give up!</said></quote>—I could hardly forbear
             laughing at the expression.—I replied,
             <said direct="false">that as long as my lord treated me with
             becoming respect, I had never in thought
             or deed given him just cause of complaint;
             but that I was not a woman to be insulted,
             or to be kept, as I had hither to been, in 
             leading-strings, by a husband.</said> My lord,                 
             flattered, as I meant he should be with the
             idea, that it was possible he should be
             suspected of keeping a wife in leading-
             strings, fell to making protestations—<said direct="false">he
             
             
             
             hoped his future conduct would prove, &amp;c.</said>
             —Upon this hint, I gave the reins to my
             imagination, and full drive I went into a
             fresh career of extravagance; if I were
             checked, it was <quote rend="italic">an insult</quote>, and I began directly
             to talk of <quote rend="italic">leading-strings</quote>. This riduculous
             game I played successfully enough,
             for some time, till at length, though naturally
             rather slow at calculations, he actually
             discovered that if we lived at the rate of
             <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty thousand</measure> a year, and had only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten 
             thousand</measure> a year to spend, we should, in
             due time, have nothing left. This notable
             discovery he communicated to me one
             morning, after a long preamble. When
             he had finished prosing, I agreed, that it 
             was demonstrably just, that he should retrench
             his expenses; but that it was equally
             unjust and impossible, that I could make
             any reformation in my civil list.—That 
             <distinct type="mentioned">economy</distinct> was a word which I had never
             heard of in my life, till I married his lordsip:
             that, upon second recollection, it 
             was true, I had heard of such a thing as 
             national economy; and that it would be 
             a very pretty, though rather hackneyed
             topic of declamation for a maiden speech
             in the <orgName>house of lords</orgName>. I therefore advised
             
             
             
             him to reserve all he had to say upon this
             subject for the noble <ecda:anonPers>lord upon the wool-
             sack</ecda:anonPers>; nay, I very graciously added, that
             upon this condition, I would go to the
             house myself to give his arguments and
             eloquence a fair hearing, and that I would
             do my best to keep myself away.—This
             was all mighty playful and witty; but it 
             happened that my <persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour</persName>, who never
             had any great taste for wit, could not this
             unluckily morning at all relish it. Of course
             I grew angry, and reminded him, with an
             indelicacy which his want of generosity
             justified, that an heiress, who had brought
             a hundred thousand pounds into his family,
             had some right to amuse herself, and that
             it was not my fault if elegant amusements
             were more expensive than others.</p>
             <p>Then came a long criminating and recriminating
            chapter. It was, <said direct="false">My lord,
            your <rs type="properAdjective">Newmarket</rs> blunders.</said>—<said direct="false">My lady,
            your cursed <emph>theatricals</emph></said>—<said direct="false">My lord, I have
            surely a right</said>—<said direct="false">and my lady, I have
            surely as good a right.</said>                 
             </p>
          <p>But, my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, however we
              might pay one another, we could not pay
              all the world with words. In short, after
              running through <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">thousands, and tens of 
              
              
              thousands</ecda:commodity>, we were actually in distress
              for <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>. Then  came selling of lands
              and I don't know what devices, for raising
              <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, according to the mode of <rs type="persGroup">lawyers
              and attorneys</rs>. It was quite indifferent to 
              me how they got <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, provided they
              did get it.—By what art these <rs type="persGroup">gentlemen</rs>
              raised <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, I never troubled myself to
              inquire; it might have been the black art,
              for any thing I know to the contrary. So I signed
              all the papers they brought to me; and I
              was mighty well pleased to find, that by so
              easy an expidient as writing <quote rend="quotes"><persName ref="#ld">T. C. H. 
              Delacour</persName></quote>, I could command money at
              will.—I signed, and signed, till at last I 
              was with all due civility informed that my
              signature was no longer worth a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">farthing</ecda:commodity>;
              and when I came to inquire into the cause
              of this phenomenon, I could no wise understand
              what my <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#ld">lord Delacour's</persName> lawyer</ecda:anonPers>
              said to me. He was a prig, and I had 
              not patience either to listen to him, or to
              look at him. I sent for an <ecda:anonPers>old uncle</ecda:anonPers> of
              mine, who used to manage all my <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>
              matters before I was married: I put the
              <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> and the <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> into a room together
              with their parchments, to fight the matter
              
              
              out, or to come to a right understanding
              if they could.—The last it seems was quite
              impossible.—In the course of half an hour,
              out comes my <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> in such a rage! I
              never shall forget his face—all the bile in
              his body had gotten into it—he had literally 
              no whites to his eyes. <said>My dear
              uncle,</said> said I, <said>What is the matter?—
              Why you are absolutely gold stick in
              waiting.</said>             
          </p>
          <p><said>No matter what I am, child,</said> said the
            <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers>, <said>I'll tell you what you are with all 
            your wit—a dupe—'tis a shame for a woman
            of your sense to be such a fool, and
            to know nothing of business—and if you
            knew nothing yourself, could you not send
            for me?</said>              
          </p>
         <p><said>I was too ignorant to know that I 
         knew nothing,</said> said I; <choice><sic></sic><corr/></choice>but I will not
         trouble you with all the said Is and said
         hes. I was made to understand, that if 
         <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> were to die the next day, I
         should live a beggar.—Upon this I grew
         serious, as you may imagine. My <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers>
         assured me that I had been grossly imposed
         upon by my lord and his <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> ,
         and that I had been swindled out of my 
         senses, and out of my dower. I repeated
         
         
         all that my <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> said, very faithfully, to
         <persName ref="md">lord Delacour</persName>: and all that either he or
         his <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> could furnish out by way of
         answer was, that <quote><said direct="false">necessity had no law</said></quote>.
         Necessity, it must be allowed, though it
         might be the mother of law, was never
         with my lord the mother of invention.
         Having now found out that I had a good
         right to complain, I indulged myself in
         it most gloriously. In short, my dear, we
         had a comfortable family quarrel—love
         quarrels are easily made up—but of money
         quarrels there is no end.—From the moment
         these money quarrels commenced,
         I began to hate <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>—before I
         had only despised him—You can have
         no notion to what meanness extravagance
         reduces men.—I have known <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>
         shirk, and look so shabby, and tell
         so many lies to people about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
         guineas</measure>—a <measure ana="#currency #commodity">hundred guineas</measure>! What do I
         say? About <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">five</measure>!—O, my
         dear, I cannot bear the thoughts of it!—
         But I was going on to tell you, that my 
         good <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers>, and all <rs type="persGroup">my relations</rs>, quarrelled
         with me for having ruined myself, as 
         they said—but I said, they quarrelled with
         me for fear I should ask them for some of
         
         
         their <quote rend="quotes" source="#shakespeare_caesar"><hi rend="allcaps">vile trash</hi></quote>.—Accordingly I abused
         and ridiculed them, one and all; and
         for my pains, all my acquaintance said
         that, <said><persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> was a woman of a
         vast deal of spirit.</said> 
         </p>
         <p>We were relieved from our money
            embarrassments by the timely death of a
            <ecda:anonPers>rich nobleman</ecda:anonPers>, to whose large estate my
            <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> was heir at law. I was intoxicated
            with the idle compliments of all
            my acquaintance, and I endeavoured to
            console myself for misery at home, by
            gayety abroad. Ambitious of pleasing universally,
            I became the worst of slaves—a
            slave to the world.—Not a moment of my
            time was at my own disposal—not one of my
            actions; I may say, not one of my
            thoughts, was my own—I was obliged to
            find things <quote rend="quotes">charming</quote> every hour, which
            tired me to death: and every day it was
            the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation.
            You wonder to hear me speak
            in this manner, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, but one must
            speak the truth sometimes; and this is
            what I have been saying to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>
            continually—continually, for these ten 
            years past. Then why persist in the same
            kind of life, you say?—Why, my dear,
            
            
            
            because I could not stop—I was fit for
            this kind of life, and for no other—I could
            not be happy at <emph>home</emph>, for what sort of a
            companion could I have made of <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>?
            By this time he was tired of his 
            <ecda:fauna>horse <name ana="#flora #food">Potato</name></ecda:fauna>, and his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Highflier</name></ecda:fauna>, and
            his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Eclips</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Goliah</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Jenny
            Grey</name></ecda:fauna>, &amp;c. and he had taken to hard
            drinking, which soon turned him, as you
            see, quite into a beast.—I forgot to tell
            you, that I had <rs type="persGroup">three children</rs> during the
            first five years of my marriage. The first
            was a <ecda:anonPers>boy</ecda:anonPers>; he was born dead; and my 
            lord, and all his <rs type="persGroup">odious relations</rs>, laid the
            blame upon me; because I would not be
            kept prisoner half a year by an <ecda:anonPers>old mother</ecda:anonPers> 
            of his, a vile <name ref="#cassandra_0001">Cassandra</name>, who was always
            prophesying, that my <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> would
            not be born alive.—My second child was a
            <ecda:anonPers>girl</ecda:anonPers>, but a poor, dimunitive, sickly thing.
             —It was the fashion at this time for <rs type="persGroup">fine
             mothers</rs> to suckle their own <rs type="persGroup">children</rs>—so
             much the worse for the poor <rs type="persGroup">brats</rs>.—Fine 
             nurses never made fine children. There 
             was a prodigious rout made about the
             matter; a vast deal of sentiment and sympathy,
             and compliments and inquiries; but
             after the novelty was over, I became hear-
             
             
             tily sick of the business; and at the end
             of about three months my poor <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> was
             sick too—I don't much like to think of it
             —it died.—If I had put it out to nurse,
             I should have been thought by my <rs type="persGroup">friends</rs>
             an unnatural mother—but I should have
             saved it's life. I should have bewailed
             the loss of the <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers> more, if <rs type="persGroup"><persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> 
             relations</rs> and <rs type="persGroup">my own</rs> had not made
             such lamentations upon the occasion, that
             I was stunned.—I couldn't or wouldn't
             shed a tear, and I left it to the <ecda:anonPers>old dowager</ecda:anonPers>
             to perform in public, as she wished,
             the part of chief mourner, and to comfort
             herself in private, by lifting up her hands
             and eyes, and railing at me as the most
             insensible of mothers. All this time I
             suffered more than she did; but that is
             what she shall never have the satisfaction 
             of knowing. I determined, that if ever
             I had another child, I would not have the
             barbarity to nurse it myself. Accordingly,
             when my third child, a <rs type="person">girl</rs>, was
             born, I sent it off immediately to the
             country, to a <ecda:anonPers>stout, healthy, broad-faced
             nurse</ecda:anonPers>, under whose care it grew and flourished;
             so that at three years old, when it
             was brought back to me, I could scarcely
             
             
             
             believe the chubby little thing was my own
             child. The same reasons, which convinced
             me I ought not to nurse my own child,
             determined me <foreign xml:lang="fr">à plus forte raison</foreign>, not to
             undertake it's education. <persName ref="#md">Lord Delacour</persName>
             could not bear the child because it was not
             a boy. The girl was put under the care 
             of a <ecda:anonPers>governess</ecda:anonPers>, who plagued my heart
             out with her airs and tracasseries for
             three or four years; at the end of which
             time, as she turned out to be <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName>
             mistress in form, I was obliged—in 
             form—to beg she would leave my house,
             and I put her pupil in better hands, I
             hope, at a celebrated academy for young
             ladies. There she will, at any rate, be
             better instructed than she could be at 
             home.—I beg your pardon, my dear, for 
             this digression on nursing and schooling,
             but I wanted only to explain to you why
             it was, that when I was weary of the 
             business, I still went on in a course of 
             dissipation. You see I had nothing at 
             home, either in the shape of husband or
             children, to engage my affections. I believe
             it was this <quote rend="quotes" source="#cowper_god">aching void</quote> in my heart,
             which made me, after looking abroad some
             time for a bosom friend, take such a pro-
             
             
             
             digious fancy to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>. She was
             just then coming into fashion—she struck
             me the first time I met her, as being
             downright ugly; but there was a wild
             oddity in her countenance which made
             one stare at her, and she was delighted to
             be stared at—especially by me—so we
             were mutually agreeable to each other—I
             as starer, and she as staree. <persName ref="#harriot_freke">Harriot Freke</persName>
             had, without comparison, more assurance
             than any man or woman I ever saw. She
             was downright brass—but of the finest
             kind—<rs type="properAdjective">Corinthian</rs> brass—She was one of
             the first who brought what I call <mcr rend="italic">harum 
             scarum</mcr> manners into fashion. I told you
             that she had assurance—<emph>impudence</emph> I
             should have called it, for no other word is
             strong enough—Such things as I have
             heard <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> say!—You will not
             believe it; but her conversation at first absolutely
             made me, like an old-fashioned
             fool, wish I had a fan to play with. But
             to my astonishment, all this <emph>took</emph> surprisingly
             with a set of fashionable young men.
             I found it necessary to <emph>reform</emph> my manners.
             If I had not taken heart of grace,
             and publicly abjured the heresies of <emph>false
             delicacy</emph>, I should have been excommuni-
             
             
             
             cated—<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> sprightly elegance
             —allow me to speak of myself in the style
             in which the newspaper writers talk of me
             —<persName ref="#ld">Lady Delacour's</persName> sprightly elegance was
             but pal—not to say <emph>faded</emph> pink, compared 
             with the scarlet of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke's</persName> dashing
             audacity. As my rival, she would on certain
             ground have beaten me hollow; it was
             therefore good policy to make her my 
             friend. We joined forces, and nothing
             could stand against us. But I have no
             right to give myself credit for good policy 
             in forming this intimacy; I really followed 
             the dictates of my heart of my imagination.
             There was a frankness in <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName>
             manner, which I mistook for artlessness of
             character. She spoke with such unbounded
             freedom on certain subjects, that I gave
             her credit for unbounded sincerity on all
             subjects. She had the talent for making the
             world believe <emph>that</emph> virtue to be invulnerable
             by nature, which disdained the common
             outworks of art for it's defence. I, 
             amongst other, took it for granted, that
             the woman who could make it her sport to
             <quote source="#pope_lady">touch the brink of all we hate</quote>, must have
             a stronger head than other people.—I
             have since been convinced, however, of my
             
             
             mistake.—I am persuaded that few can
             touch the brink without tumbling headlong
             down the precipice—Don't apply this, my
             dear, <emph>literally</emph>, to the person of whom we
             were speaking. I am not base enough to
             betray her secrets, however I may have
             been provoked by her treachery. Of her
             character and history you shall hear
             nothing, but what is necessary for my own
             justification. The league of amity between
             us was scarcely ratified, before my <persName ref="#md">lord
             Delacour</persName> came with his wise remonstrating
             face, to beg me to <quote><said>consider what was
             due to my own honour and his</said></quote>.—Like
             the <rs type="person" ref="#ephraim_jenkinson_0001">cosmogony-man</rs> in the <title ref="goldsmith_vicar"><rs type="person" ref="#charles_primrose_0001">vicar of

             cant phrase, which had once stood him in
             stead.—<said>Do you think, my lord,</said> said I, 
             <said>that because I gave up <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> to
             oblige you, I shall give up all common
             sense, to suit myself to your taste?—<persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot
             Freke</persName> is visited by every body but old
             dowagers and old maids.—I am neither an
             old dowager nor an old maid—The consequence 
             is obvious, my lord.</said>—Pertness
             in dialogue, my dear, often succeeds better
             with my lord than wit.—I therefore
             saved the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">sterling gold</ecda:commodity>, and bestowed
             
             
             upon him nothing but counters—I tell you
             this to save the credit of my taste and
             judgment.—But to return to my friendship.
             for <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>. I, of course, repeated
             her every word which had passed between
             my husband and me. She out
             Heroded <persName ref="#herod_the_great_74">Herod</persName> upon the occasion; and
             laughed so much at what she called my 
             folly in <emph>pleading guilty</emph> in the <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
             cause, that I was downright ashamed of
             myself, and purely to prove my innocence,
             I determined, upon the first convenient
             opportunity, to renew my intimacy with
             the colonel. The opportunity which I so
             ardently desired of redeeming my independence,
             was not long wanting.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
             as my stars (which you know are always 
             more in fault than ourselves) would have
             it, returned just at this time from the
             continent, where he had been with his
             regiment; he returned with a <seg ana="#injury">would 
             across his forehead, and a black fillet
             which made him look something more
             like a hero, and ten times more like a 
             coxcomb, than ever.</seg>—He was in fashion
             at all events, and amongst other ladies,
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>—odious <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>!
             smiled upon him.—The Colonel, however,
             
             
             had taste enough to know the difference 
             between smile and smile; he laid himself
             and his <ecda:flora>laurels</ecda:flora> at my feet, and I carried
             him and them about in triumph. Wherever
             I went, especially to <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>,
             envy and scandal joined hands to attack 
             me, and I heard wondering and whispering
             wherever I went. I had no object in view
             but to provoke my husband, therefore conscious
             of the purity of my intentions, it
             was my delight to brave the opinion of the
             wondering world. I gave myself no concern
             about the effect my coquetry might
             have upon the object of this flirtation—
             poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>!—heart, I took it for granted,
             he had none—how should a coxcomb
             come by a heart?—Vanity I knew he
             had in abundance, but this gave me
             no alarm, as I thought that if it should
             ever make him forget himself—I mean
             forget what was due to me—I could, by
             one flash of my wit, strike him to the 
             earth, or blast him for ever. One night
             we had been together at <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>
             —she amongst other good things, kept a
             faro bank—and I am convinced,c hated
             —Be that as it may, I lost an immensity
             of money, and it was my pride to lose
             
             
             with as much gayety as any body else
             could win; so I was, or appeared to be
             in uncommonly high spirits, and <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
             had his share of my good humour. We
             left <placeName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</placeName> together early; about
             half past one. As the colonel was going
             to hand me to my carrige, a smart-looking
             young man, as I thought, came up
             close to the coach door, and stared me
             full in the face: I was not a woman to be
             disconcerted at such a thing as this, but
             I really was startled when the young fellow
             jumped into the carriage after me: I
             thought he was mad: I had only courage
             enough to scream.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> seized hold
             of the intruder to drag him out, and out 
             he dragged the youth, exclaiming in a
             high tone—<said>What is the meaning of all
             this, sir?—Who the devil are you?—My
             name's <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>:—who the devil are
             you?</said> The answer to this was a convulsion
             of laughter. By the laugh, I knew
             it to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>.—<said>Who am I!
             only a <name>Freke</name>!</said> cried she—<said>shake hands.</said>
             I gave her my hand, into the carriage 
             she sprang, and desired the Colonel to
             follow her: <persName>Lawless</persName> laughed, we all
             laughed, and drove away. <said>Where do
             
             
             
             you think I've been?</said> said <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>, <said>in 
             the gallery of the <orgName>House of Commons</orgName>;
             almost squeezed to death these four hours;
             but I swore I'd hear <persName ref="#richard_sheridan_1751">Sheridan's</persName> speech
             to-night, and I did—Betted fifty guineas
             I would, with <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, and ahve
             wone.—Fun and <name>Freke</name> for ever, huzza!</said>
             <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> was mad with spirits, and so
             noisy and unmanageable, that, as I told
             her, I was sure she was drunk.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
             in his silly way, laughed incessantly, and
             I was so taken up with her oddities, that, 
             for some time, I did not perceive we were
             going the <name>Lord</name> knows where; till, at last,
             when the 'larum of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> voice ceased
             for an instant, I was struck with the strange
             sound of the carriage. <said>Where are we?
             Not upon the stones, I'm sure;</said> said I;
             and putting my head out of the window, I
             saw we were beyond the turnkpike.—<said>The
             <ecda:anonPers>coachman's</ecda:anonPers> drunk as well as you, <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>,</said>
             said I; and was going to pull the 
             string to stop him, but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> had hold
             of it.—<said>The man is going very right,</said>
             said she, <said>I've told him where to go.—
             Now don't fancy that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> and I are
             going to run away with you.—All this is 
             unnecessary now-a-days, thank <name>God</name></said>—
             
             
             
             To this I agreed, and laughed for fear
             of being ridiculous.—<said>Guess where you
             are going,</said> said <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>.—I guessed and
             guessed, but could not guess right; and
             my merry companions were infinitely diverted
             with my perplexity and impatience,
             more especially, as I believe, in spite of
             all my efforts I grew rather graver than 
             usual. We went on to the end of <placeName>Sloane-
             street</placeName>, and quite out of town; at last we
             stopped.—It was dark, the <ecda:anonPers>footman's</ecda:anonPers> flambeau
             was out, I could only just see by the
             lamps, that we were at the door of a lone,
             odd looking house.—The house door
             opened, and an <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> appeared with
             a lantern in her hand.             
         </p>
         <p><said>Where is this farce, or freak, or whatever
         you call it, to end?</said> said I, as <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
         pulled me into the dark passage along
         with her.             
         </p>
         </said>
         <p><said xml:id="s009" prev="#s008">Alas! my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady

         not come yet to the tragical part of my
         story, and as long as I can laugh, I will.
         —As the <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> and her miserable
         light went on before us, I could almost have thought of <persName ref="#bertrand_0001">sir Bertrand</persName>, or of
         some German <emph>horrifications</emph>, but I heard
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who never could help laughing
         at the wrong time, bursting behind me,
         with a sense of his own superiority.</said>

         </p>
         <p><said>Yes! from the celebrated <persName ref="#mrs_w_0001">Mrs. W―</persName>,
         the modern dealer in art magic,</said> said I,
         laughing, <said>for now I guess whereabouts I
         am.</said>—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel Lawless's</persName> laugh broke the
         spell—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>, never whilst you
         live expect to succeed in <emph>the sublime</emph>.—
         <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> swore at the colonel, for the veriest
         <emph>spoil-sport</emph> she had ever seen, and she
         whispered to me—<said>the reason he laughs
         is, because he is afraid of our suspecting
         the truth of him, that he believes <foreign xml:lang="fr">toute de
         bon</foreign> in conjuragion, and the devil, and all
         that.</said>—The <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers>, whose cue I
         found was to be dumb, opened a door at
         the top of a narrow staircase, and pointing
         to a tall figure, completely enveloped
         in fur, left us to our fate. I will not 
         trouble you with a pompous description
         of all the mummery of the scene, my dear,
         as I despair of being able to frighten
         you out of your wits. I should have been
         
         
         downright angry with <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> for
         bringing me to such a place, but that I
         knew women of the first fashion had been 
         with <persName ref="#mrs_w_0001">Mrs. W―</persName>before us—some in
         somber sadness—some by way of frolic—
         So as there was no fear of being ridiculous,
         there was no shame, you know, and
         my conscience was quite at ease. <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
         had no conscience, so she was always 
         at ease; and never more so than in male
         atire, which she had been told became 
         her particularly. She supported the character 
         of a young rake with such spirit
         and <emph>truth</emph>, that I am sure no common
         conjurer could have discovered any thing
         feminine about her. She rattled on with
         a set of nonsensical questions; and among
         other things, she asked, <said>How soon will
         <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> marry again after <rs ref="#md" type="person">her lord's</rs>
         death?</said>             
         </p>
         <p><said>She will never marry after <rs type="person" ref="#md">her lord's</rs>
         death,</said> answered the <rs type="person" ref="#mrs_w_0001">oracle</rs>.—<said>Then she
         will marry during his life-time,</said> said <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>,
         —<said>True,</said> answered the oracle—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel
         Lawless</persName> laughed; I was angry; and
         the colonel would have been quiet, for he
         was a gentleman, but there was no such 
         thing as managing <persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who, though
             
             
         she had laid aside the modesty of her own
         sex, had not acquired the decency of the
         other.—<said>Who is to be <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName>
         second husband?</said> cried she. <said>You'll not
         offend any of the present company by
         naming the man.</said>—<said>Her second husband
         I cannot name,</said> replied the oracle, <said>but
         let her beware of a <name>Lawless</name> lover.</said> <persName ref="#hf">Mrs
         Freke</persName> and <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>, encouraged
         by her, triumphed over me without mercy;
         I may say, without shame!—Well
         my dear, I am in a hurry to have done 
         with all this: though I <quote rend="quotes"><hi rend="italic">doated upon
         folly</hi></quote>, yetI was terrified at the thoughts
         of any thing worse. The idea of a divorce,
         the public brand of shameful life,
         shocked me, in spite of all my real and all
         my assumed levity. O that I had, at this
         instant, dared to <emph>be myself</emph>! But my fear
         of ridicule was greater than my fear of
         vice.—<said>Bless me, my dear <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
         whispered <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>, as we left this 
         house, <said>what can make you in such a 
         desperate hurry to get home?—You gape
         and fidget—one might think you had
         never sat up a night before in your life.—
         I verily believe you are afraid to trust
         yourself with us.—Which of us are you
         
         
         
         afraid of; <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, or me, or <emph>yourself</emph>!</said>
         —There was a tone of contempt in the
         last words, which piqued me to the quick;
         and, however strange it may seem, I was
         now anxious to convince <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> that
         I was not afraid of myself—False shame
         made me act, as if I had no shame—You
         would not suspect me of knowing any
         thing of false shame, but depend upon it,
         my dear, many, who appear to have as
         much assurance as I have, are secretly it's
         slaves.—I moralize, because I am come to
         a part of my story, which I should almost
         be glad to omit—but I promised you, that
         there should be no sinse of omission. It
         was light, but not broad daylight, when
         we got to <placeName>Knightsbridge</placeName>. <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> encouraged,
         for I cannot deny it, by the 
         levity of my manner, was in higher and more familiar
         spirits than I ever saw him.—<persName ref="#hf">Mrs. Freke</persName>
         desired me to set her down at her <ecda:anonPers>sister's</ecda:anonPers>   
         who lived in <placeName>Grosvenor Place</placeName>.—I did so,
         and I beg you to believe, that I was in an
         agony to get rid of my colonel at the 
         same time; but you know, I could not,
         before <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName>, absolutely say to
         him—<said>Get out!</said>—Indeed, to tell things
             
             
         as they were, it was scarcely possible to
         guess by my manner, that I was under
         any anxiety—I acted my part so well, or
         so ill.—As <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> jumped out of
         the coach, a <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crowed in the area of
         her <ecda:anonPers>sister's</ecda:anonPers> house, <said>There!</said> cried <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>,
         <said>do you hear the <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crow, <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour?</persName>—</said>
         <said>Now it's to be hoped your fear
         of goblins is over—else I would not be
         so cruel, as to leave the pretty dear all
         alone.</said>—<said>All alone,</said> answered I—<said>your
         friend the colonel is much obliged to you
         for making nobody of him.</said>—<said>My friend
         the cololnel,</said> whispered <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>, leaning
         with her bold masculine arms folded upon
         the coach door—<said>My friend the colonel is
         much obliged to me, I'm sure, for remembering  
         what the cunning, or the knowing
         woman told us just now, that you and he are
         —or are to be—one and the same person.
         So when I said I left you alone, I
         was not guilty of a bull, was I?</said>—I had
         the grace to be heartily ashamed of this
         speech, and called out in utter confusion
         —<said>to <placeName>Berkeley Square</placeName>.―But where shall 
         I set you down, colonel<sic>!</sic>—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>, good
         morning—don't forget you are in man's 
         clothes.</said>—I did not dare to repeat the 
             
             
         question of <said>where shall I set you down,
         colonel?</said> at this instant, because <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
         gave me such an arch sneering look, as
         much as to say—still afraid of yourself!—
         We drove on—I'm persuaded that the 
         confusion which, in spite of all my efforts,
         broke through my affected levity, encourated 
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was natrually a coxcomb
         and a fool, to believe that I was
         actually his—else he never could have
         been so insolent.—In short, my dearh, before
         we had got through the turnpike gate,
         I was downright obliged to say to him—
         <said>Get out!</said>—which I did with a degree 
         of indignation, that quite astonished him.
         —He muttered something about ladies
         knowing their minds—and I own, though
         I went off with flying colours, I secretly
         blamed myself as much as I did him, and 
         I blamed <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> more than I did either.
         —I sent for her the next day as soon as I 
         could, to consult her. She expressed such
         astonishment, and so much concern, at 
         this catastrophe of our night's frolic, and
         blamed herself with so many oaths, and
         execrated <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> for a coxcomb so much
         to the ease and satisfaction of my conscience,
         that I was confirmed in my good
         
         
         opinion of her, and indeed felt for her the
         most lively affection and esteem—for observe,
         with me esteem ever followed affection,
         instead of affection following esteem.
         —Wo be to all, who in morals preposterously
         put the cart before the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>!—But
         to proceed with my history—all fashionable
         historians stop to make reflections,
         supposing that no one else can have the 
         sense to make any. My <emph>esteemed</emph> friend
         agreed with me, that it would be best for 
         all parties concerned to hush up this business;
         that as <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was going out of
         town in a few days, to be elected for a
         borough, we should get rid of im in the
         best way possible, without <quote>more last
         words</quote>—that he had been punished sufficiently
         on the spot, and that to punish
         twice for the same offence, once in private
         and once in public, would be contrary to
         the laws of <name>Englishmen</name> and <name>Englishwomen</name>,
         and in my case would be contrary to
         the evident dictates of prudence—because
         I could not complain, without calling up
         <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> to call <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> out—This
         I could not do without acknowledging
         that his lordship had been in the right,
         in warning me about his <quote rend="italic">honour and my
         
         
         
         own</quote>, which old phrase I dreaded to hear
         for the ninety-ninth time; besides, <persName ref="#md">lord
         Delacour</persName> was the last man in the world
         I should have chosen for my knight—
         though unluckily he was my lord—Besides,
         all things considered, I thought the
         whole story might not tell so well in the 
         world for me, tell it which way I would
         —We therefore agreed, that it would be
         most expedient to hold our tongues. We 
         took it for granted, that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> would
         hold his, and as for my people, they knew
         nothing, I thought, or if they did, I was
         sure of them. How the thing got abroad,
         I could not at the time conceive, though
         now I am well acquainted with the baseness
         and treachery of the woman I called
         my friend.—The letter was known and
         talked of every where the next day, and
         the story was told especially at the odious
         <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>, with such exaggerations
         as drove me almost mad.—I was
         enraged, inconceivably enraged with <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
         from whom I imagined the reports originated.

           to myself, the most dreadful sensation I

          <said><p>I left off with the true skill of a
           good story-teller, at the most interesting
           part—a duel—and yet, duels are so common
           now, that they are really vulgar incidents.              
          </p>
          <p>But we think that a duel concerning
           ourselves must be more extraordinary 
           than any other. We hear of men being
           shot in duels about nothing every day,
           so it is really a weakness in me to think
           so much about poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless's</persName> death, as
           <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> said to me at the time.—
           She expected to see me show sorrow in
           <emph>public</emph>—but very fortunately for me, she
           roused my pride—which was always 
           stronger than my reason; and I behaved
           myself upon the occasion as became a fine
           lady.—There were some things, however,
           
           
           I could hardly stand.—You must know
           that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, fool and coxcomb as he
           was, had some magnanimity, and showed
           it—as some people do from whom it is
           least expected—on his deathbed. The
           last words he said, were <said><persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           is innocent—I charge you don't prosecute
           <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.</said>—This he said to his mother
            —who—to complete my misery—is
            one of the most respectable women in
            <placeName>England</placeName>, and was most desperately fond
            of <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was an only son.—She
            never has recovered his loss.—Do you
            remember asking me who a tall elderly
            lady in mourning was, that you saw getting 
            into her carriage one day, at <placeName><placeName>South-
            Audley-street</placeName> chapel</placeName>, as we passed by in
            our way to the park?—That was <persName ref="#lawless_0002">lady
            Lawless</persName>—I believe I didn't answer you
            at the time.—I meet her every now and
            then—to me a spectre of dismay.—But
            as <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> said, certainly such a
            man as poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was a useless being
            in society, however he may be regretted
            by a doating mother.—We should see
            things in a philosophical light if we can.—
            I should not have suffered half as much as
            I did, if he had been a man of a stronger
            
            
            
            understanding; but he was a poor, vain,
            weak creature, that I actually drew on
            and duped with my own coquetry, whilst
            all the time I was endeavouring only to
            plague <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>.—I was punished
            enough by the airs his lordship doubly 
            gave himself, upon the strength of his
            valour and his judgment—they roused me
            completely—and I blamed him with all
            my might, and got an enormous party of
            <rs type="persGroup">my friends</rs>, I mean my acquaintance,
            to run him down full cry, for having
            fought for me—It was absurd—It was
            rash—It was want of proper confidence
            in his wife; <mcr rend="italic">thus we</mcr> said:—<persName ref="#md">lord
            Delacour</persName> had his partizans, it was true,
            amongst whom the loudest was the odious
            <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. I embraced the first opportunity
            I met with of retaliation.—You
            must know that <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, beside
            being a great faro-player, was a great
            dabbler in politics; for she was almost as
            fond of power as of money: she talked
            loud and fluently, and ahd, somehow or
            other, partly by intriguing, partly by relationship,
            connected herself with <rs type="persGroup">some of
            the leading men in <orgName>parliament</orgName></rs>.—There 
            was to be a contested election in our our 
            
            
            county; <persName ref="#luttridge_0002">Mr. Luttridge</persName> had a good estate
            there next to <placeName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</placeName>, and being
            of an ancient family, and keeping a good
            table, the <name>Luttridges</name> were popular enough.
            —At the first news of an election, out
            comes a flaming advertisement from <persName ref="#luttridge_0002">Mr.
            Luttridge</persName>; away posted <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>
            to begin her canvas, and away posted
            <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> after her, to canvas for a
            <ecda:anonPers>cousin of <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke's</persName></ecda:anonPers>—This was a
            new scene for me; but I piqued myself
            on the versatility of my talents, and I laid
            myself out to please all the squires, and, 
            what was more difficult, all the squires'
            ladies in <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. I was ambitious to
            have it said of me, <said>that I was the finest
            figure that ever appeared upon a canvass.</said>
            —O ye <name>*****shireians</name>, how hard did I
            work to obtrain your praise!—All that the
            combined force of vanity and hatred could
            inspire, I performed, and with success.
            You have but little curiosity, I presume,
            to know how many <measure>hogsheads</measure> of <ecda:food ana="#commodity">port</ecda:food>
            went down the throat of <persName ref="#john_bull_1712">John Bull</persName>, or
            how many <ecda:food ana="#fauna">hacatombs</ecda:food> were offered up to
            the genius of <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> liberty. My hatred
            to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> was, of course, 
            called love of my country, <persName ref="#ld">Lady Dela-
            
            
            
            cour</persName> was deified by all <emph>true</emph> patriots—and,
            luckily, a handsome legacy left me for my
            spirit, by an <ecda:anonPers>uncle</ecda:anonPers> who died six weeks
            before the election, enabled us to sustain
            the expence of my apotheosis.—The day
            of election came—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> and I
            made our appearance on the hustings,
            dressed in splendid party uniforms; and
            before us, our knights and squires held
            <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">two enormous panniers full of ribands and
            cockades</ecda:commodity>; which we distributed with a
            grace that won all hearts, if not all votes.
            —<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> thought the panniers
            would carry the election; and forthwith
            she sent off an express for a pair of pannier
            twice as large as ours. I took out
            my pencil, and drew a caricature of <quote>the <ecda:fauna>ass</ecda:fauna> 
            and her panniers</quote>: wrote an epigram at
            the bottom of it; and the epigram and
            the caricature were soon in the hands of
            half <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. The verses were as bad
            as impromptus usually are, and the drawing
            was not much better than the writing,
            but the <emph>good will</emph> of the critics supplied
            all my deficiencies; and never was more
            praise bestowed upon the pen of <persName ref="#edmund_burke_1729">Burke</persName>,
            or the pencil of <persName ref="#joshua_reynolds_1723">Reynolds</persName>, than was lavished
            upon me by my honest friends. 
            
            
            
            
            —My dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, if you will not
             quarrel with the quality, you may have
             what quantity of praise you please.—
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I hoped and expected,
             was beyond measure enraged at the
             sight of the caricature and epigram.—
             She was, besides being a gamester and
             a politician—what do you think?—an
             excellent shot!—She wished, she said, to
             be a man, that she might be qualified to
             take proper notice of my conduct.—The
             same kind friends who shewed her my 
             epigram, repeated to me her observation
             upon it. <persName ref="#hf">Harriot Freke</persName> was at my elbow,
             and offered to take any <emph>message</emph> I might
             think proper to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. I scarcely
             thought her in earnest, till she added,
             that the only way left, now-a-days, for a
             woman to distinguish herself, was by
             spirit; as every thing else was grown
             <said>cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men</said>—
             That she knew <ecda:anonPers>one of the cleverest young
             men</ecda:anonPers> in <placeName>England</placeName>, and a man of fashion
             into the bargin, who was just going to
             publish a treatise <title>upon the Propriety
             and Necessity of Female Duelling</title>; and
             that he had demonstrated beyond a possibility
             of doubt, that civilized society could
             
             
             
             not exist half a century longer without
             this necessary improvement. I had prodigious 
             deference for the masculine superiority,
             as I thought it, of <persName ref="#hf">Harriot's</persName> understanding.
             She was a philosopher, and
             a fine lady—I was only a fine lady—I had
             never fired a pistol in my life; and I was
             a little inclined to cowardice; but <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> 
             offered to bet any wager upon the
             steadiness of my hand, and assured me
             that I should charm all beholder in male
             attire—In short, as my second, if I would
             furnish her with proper credentials, she
             swore she would undertake to furnish me
             with clothes, and pistols, and courage, and
             every thing I wanted.—I sat down to pen
             my challenge. When I was writing it,
             my hand did not tremble <emph>much</emph>—not more
             than my <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour's</persName> always does.
             The challenge was very prettily worded—
             I believe I can repeat it.

          <p>I cannot repeat <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName> answer;
             all I know is, it was not half as
             neatly worded as my note; but the essential
             part of it was, that she accepted 
             my challenge <emph>with pleasure</emph>, and should
             do herself the honour of meeting me at
             six o'clock the next morning—that <persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">miss
             Honour O'Grady</persName> would be her <distinct>friend</distinct>
             upon the occasion—and that pistols were
             the weapons she preferred. The place of
             appointment was behind an old barn, about
             <measure>two miles</measure> from the town of <placeName>*****</placeName>. The
             hour was fixed to be early in the morning,
             to prevent all probability of interruption.
             In the evening, <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> and I
             rode to the ground. There were several 
             bullets sticking in the posts of the Barn:
             —this was the place where <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs Luttridge</persName>
             had been accustomsed to exercise 
             herself in firing at a mark. I own my
             
             
             
             courage <quote rend="quotes">oozed out</quote> a little at this sight.
              —The <persName>duke de <placeName>Rochefoucault</placeName></persName>, I believe,
              said truly, that <quote rend="quotes">many would be cowards
              if they dared</quote>. There seemed to me to
              be no physical, and less moral necessity
              for my fighting this duel, but I did not
              venture to reason on a point of honour
              with my spirited second. I bravadoed to
              <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> most magnanimously; but at
              night, when <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> was undressing me,
              I could not forbear giving her a hint,
              which I thought might tend to preserve
              the <rs type="person" ref="george_III_england_1738">king's</rs> peace, and the peace of the
              county. I went to the ground in the 
              morning, in good spirits and with a safe
              conscience. <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName> was in admiration of
              my <quote rend="quotes"><ecda:fauna>lion</ecda:fauna>-port</quote>: and to do her justice,
              she conducted herself with great coolness
              upon the occasion; but then it may be 
              observed, that it was I who was to stand
              fire, and not she. I thought of poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
              a billion of times at least, as we were 
              going to the ground; and I had my presentiments,
              and my confused notions of
              poetic justice—but poetic jutice, and all
              other sorts of justice, went clear out of
              my head, when I saw my antagonist and
              her friend actually pistol in hand, waiting
              
              
              for us: they were both in men's clothes.
              —I secretly called upon the name of <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> 
              with fervency, and I looked found
              with more anxiety than ever <ecda:anonPers><persName>Bluebeard's</persName>
              wife</ecda:anonPers>, or <quote rend="quptes"><persName>Anne</persName>, sister <persName>Anne</persName>!</quote> looked to
              see if any body was coming: nothing was
              to be seen, but the grass blown by the
              wind—No <persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> to throw herself <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">toute
              éplorée</foreign> between the combatants—no <rs type="persGroup">peace

              —no deliverance at hand—and
              <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, by all the laws of honour,
              as challenged, was to have the first shot—
              O, those laws of honour!—I was upon
              the point of making an apology, in spite
              of them all, when, to my inexpressible
              joy, I was relieved from the dreadful alternative
              of being shot through the head, 
              or of becoming a laughing-stock for life,
              by an incident, less heroic I'll grant you,
              than opportune.—But you shall have the 
              whole scene, as well as I can recollect it
              —<emph>as well</emph>—for those who, for the first
              time, go into a field of battle, do not, as
              I am credibly informed, and internally
              persuaded, always find the clearness of
              their memories improved by the novelty
              of their situation. <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs Luttridge</persName>, when
              
              
              we came up, was leaning, with a truly
              martial negligence, against the wall of the
              barn, with her pistol, as I told you, in her
              hand. She spoke not a word, but her
              second <persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">Honour O'Grady</persName>, advanced
              toward us immediately, and taking off
              her hat very manfully, addressed herself
              to my second.—<said><persName ref="#hf">Mistress Harriot Freke</persName>,
              I presume, if I mistake not.</said>—<persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
              bowed slightly, and answered—<said><persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">Miss Honour

              which I delight, therefore, I beg that 
              mayn't be spared on my account; as to
              bloodshed, I beg that may not be spared
              on <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> account, for her honour,
              I am sure, is dearer to her than her 
              blood; and as to ill-will, I should be concerned
              to have that saved on <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>
              account, as we all know it is the
              thing in which she delights, even more 
              than I do in noise, or <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> in

              <persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">Honour</persName>, <said>that one, who is compelled

              means on a footing with one who has
              the advantage of her right hand.</said> <persName ref="#hf">Harriot</persName>
              rubbed my pistol with the sleve of 
              her coat, and I, recovering my with with
              my hopes of being witty with impunity,
              answered—<said>Unquestionably!—left-handed
              wisdom and left-handed courage are
              neither of them the very best of their 
              kinds, but we must content ourselves
              with them, <emph>if</emph> we can have no other.</said>
              <said>That <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">if</distinct>,</said> cried <persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">Honour O'Grady</persName>, <said>is not,

              <seg ana="#injury">My <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>, I was going 
              to observe, that my principal has met
              with an unfortunate accident in the shape
              of a whitlow on the fore-finger of her
              right hand, which incapacitates her from

              ladies, either of you, that can't put
              up with a disappointment with good humour.</said>—I never, during the whole course
              of my existence, was more disposed to
              bear a disappointment with good humour,
              
              
              to prove that I was incapable of bearing
              malice; and, to oblige the <rs type="persGroup">seconds</rs>, for
              forms sake, I agreed that we should take
              our ground, and fire our pistols into the
              air–<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, with her left-handed
              wisdom, fired first—and I, with great
              magnanimity, followed her example.—I
              must do my adversary's second, <persName ref="#honour_ogrady_0001">miss
              Honour O'Grady</persName>, the justice to observe,
              that in this whole affair she conducted herself
              not only with the spirit, but with the
              good nature and generosity characteristic
              of her nation—We met enemies and 
              parted friends.
          </p>    
          <p>Life is a tragicomedy!—Though the
             critics will allow of no such thing in their 
             books, it is a true representation of what
             passes in the world; and of all lives,
             mine has been the most grotesque mixture,
             or alternation, I should say, of tragedy
             and comedy.—All this is a-propos
             to something I have not told you yet.
             —This comic duel ended tragically
             for me—<said>How?</said>—you say—Why 'tis clear
             that I was not shot through the head;
             but it would have been better, a hundred 
             times better for me, if I had; I
             should have been spared, in this life at
             
             
             
             least, the torments of the damned—<seg ana="#injury">I was 
             not used to priming and loading—my
             pistol was overcharged—when I fired, it
             recoiled, and I received a blow on my
             breast, the consequences of which you
             have seen.</seg>              
          </p> 
          <p>The pain was nothing at the moment
              compared with what I have since experienced
              —But I will not complain till I
              cannot avoid it—I ahd not, at hte time I
              received the blow, much leisure for lamentation!
              for I had scarcely discharged my
              pistol, when we heard a loud shout on
              the other side of the barn, and a <rs type="persGroup">crowd
              of town's people, country people, and
              haymakers</rs>, came pouring down the lane
              towards us with rakes and pitchforks in
              their hands.—An <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> is really a
              formidable thing.—<persName ref="#m">Marriot</persName> had mismanaged
              her business most strangely—she
              had, indeed, spread report of a duel—a
              female duel—but the untutored sense of 
              propriety amongst these rusticks was so
              shocked at the idea of a duel fought by
              women in <emph>men's clothes</emph>, that I verily believe
              they would have thrown us into the
              river with all their hearts—Stupid blockheads!
              I am convinced that they would 
              
              
              not have been half so scandalized if
              we had boxed in petticoats—The want of
              these petticoats had nearly proved our destruction,
              or at least our disgrace—a 
              peeress, after being ducked, could never
              have held her head above water again
              with any grace.—The <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> had just closed
              round us, crying <said>shame! shame! shame!
              —duck 'em,—duck 'em—gentle or simple
              —duck 'em—duck 'em</said>—when their attention
              was suddenly turned towards a
              person, who was driving up the lane a
              large herd of <ecda:fauna>squeaking, grunting pigs</ecda:fauna>.—
              The person was clad in splendind regimentals,
              and he was armed with a long
              pole, to the end of which hung a bladder,
              and his <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> were frightened, and they ran
              squeaking from one side of the road to the
              other; and the <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver in regimentals
              in the midst of the noise, could not without
              difficulty make his voice heard; but at 
              last he was understood to say, that a bet
              of a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred guineas</measure> depended upon his
              being able to keep these <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> a head of a
              flock of <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> that were following them,
              and he begged the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> to give him and 
              his <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> fair play.—At the news of this 
              wager, and at the sight of the gentleman
              
              
              turned <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver, the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> were in raptures,
              and, at the sound of his voice, <persName ref="#hf">Harriot

              our hero, addressing himself to the sturdy

              —<said>Huzza, my boys! <placeName>Old England</placeName> for

              his flock—<persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> shook a pole, from the 
              top of which hung a bladder full of <ecda:flora>beans</ecda:flora>.
              The <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna> grunted—the <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna> gobbled,
              and the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> shoulted—eager for the fame
              of <placeName>Old England</placeName>, the crowd followed <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
              with loud acclamations.—The
              <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> officer</ecda:anonPers> was followed with groans
              and hisses.—So great was the confusion,
              and so great the zeal of the patriots, that
              even the pleasure of ducking the female
              duellists was forgotten in the general enthusiasm.
              —All eyes and hearts were intent
              upon the race—and now the <ecda:fauna>turkies</ecda:fauna>
              got foremost—and now the <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna>.—But
              when we came within sight of the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>-
              pond, I heard <ecda:anonPers>one man</ecda:anonPers> cry—<said>don't forget
              the ducking.</said>—How I trembled! but our
              knight shouted to his <rs type="persGroup">followers</rs>—<said>For the 
              love of old <placeName>England</placeName>, my brave boys, keep
              
              
              between my <ecda:fauna>fauna</ecda:fauna> and the pond—if our <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna>
              see the water, they'll run to it, and <placeName>England's</placeName> undone.</said>             
          </p> 
            <p>The whole fury of the <rs type="persGroup">mob</rs> was by 
               this speech conducted away from us.—
               <said>On, on, mu boys, into town, to the market-
               place; whoever gains the market-
               place first, wins the day.</said>—Our general
               shook the rattling bladder in triumph, over
               the heads of <quote>the swinish multitude</quote>, as 
               we followed in perfect security in his train
               into the town.             
          </p>
          <p><rs type="persGroup">Men, women, and children</rs>, crowded
             to the windows and doors.—<said>Retreat
             into the first place you can,</said> whispered
             <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName>
               
               
           </p>
              
          </said>
              
           
           
           
           
           
       </div>
