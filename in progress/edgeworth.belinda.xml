                        reading, and disposed to conduct herself
                        with prudence and integrity. Her character,

                                   and consequently the most ridiculous manner,
                                   so as to expose themselves before the

                                   tittering, and flirting; full of the present
                                   moment, never reflecting upon the future;

                                   grows tired of them? If they have large

                                   to divert themselves for a season or two
                                   without doubt; they are sure to be sought

                                   upon this subject, my dear. Even with

                                   observed how foolish young people offend
                                   those who are the most necessary to their
                                   interests, by an imprudent indulgence of
                                   their vanity.

                 <p>It is sometimes fortunate, that the means,
                     which are taken to produce cerrtain effects
                     upon the mind, have a tendency directly
                     opposite to what is expected. <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>
                     perpetual anxiety about her niece's
                     appearance, manners, and establishment,
                     had completely worn out <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> patience;
                     she had become more insensible to
                     the praises of her personal charms and accomplishments,
                     than young women of her
                     age usually are, because she had been so
                     much flattered and <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">shown off</distinct>, as it is called,
                     by her match-making aunt. Yet <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                     was fond of amusement, and had 
                     imbibed some of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> preju-

                     <fw type="pageNum">8</fw>
                     dices in favour of rank and fashion. Her
                     taste for literature declined in proportion
                     to her intercourse with the fashionable
                     world, as she did not in this society, perceive
                     the least use in the knowledge that 
                     she had acquired. Her mind had never 
                     been roused to much reflection; she had
                     in general acted but as a puppet in the
                     hands of others. To her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_00001">aunt Stanhope</persName>
                     she had hitherto paid unlimited, habitual,
                     blind obedience; but she was more free from affectation
                     and coquetry, than could have been expected,
                     after the course of documenting,
                     which she had gone through. She was 
                     charmed with the idea of her visit to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                     Delacour</persName>, whom she thought the most
                     agreeable—no, that is too feeble an expression—
                     the most fascinating person she
                     had ever beheld. Such was the light in 
                     which her ladyship appeared, not only to
                     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but to all the world—that is to
                     say, all the world of fashion, and she knew
                     of no other.—The newspapers were full 
                     of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> parties, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
                     dresses, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> bon
                     mots: every thing, that her ladyship said,
                     was repeated as witty: every thing, that
                     <pb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum">9</fw>
                     her ladyship wore, was imitated as fashionable.
                     Female wit sometimes depends on
                     the beauty of it's possessor, for it's reputation;
                     and the reign of beauty is proverbially
                     short, and fashion often capriciously
                     deserts her favourites, even before nature
                     withers their charms. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
                     seemed to be the fortunate exception to
                     these general rules: long after she had
                     lost the bloom of youth, she continued to
                     be admired as a fashionable <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</foreign>; and
                     long after she had ceased to be a novelty
                     in society, her company was courted by 
                     all the gay, the witty, and the gallant.
                     To be seen in public with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
                     to be a visitor at her house, were privileges,
                     of which numbers were vehemently
                     ambitious; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> was congratulated
                     and envied by all her acquaintance, for being admitted as an inmate.
                     Howe could she avoid thinking herself singularly 
                     fortunate?
                 </p>
                 <p>A short time after her arrival at <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

                     domestic misery.—Abroad, and at home,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was two different persons.
                     Abroad she appeared all life, spirit, and

                     <fw type="pageNum">10</fw>
                     good humour—at home, listless, fretful,
                     and melancholy; she seemed like a spoiled
                     actress off the stage, over stiumlated
                     by applause, and exhausted by the exertions
                     of supporting a fictitious character.
                     —When her house was filled with well-
                     dressed crowds, when it blazed with lights,
                     and resounded with music and dancing,
                     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in the character of the
                     mistres of the revels, shone the soul and
                     spirit of pleasure and frolic—But the moment
                     the company retired, when the
                     music ceased, and the lights were extinguishing,
                     the spell was dissolved.                     
                 </p>
                 <p>She would sometimes walk up and down 
                     the empty magnificent saloon, absorbed in
                     thoughts seemingly of the most painful 
                     nature.

                        uncommonly pleasant young man.
                    </p>
                    <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> might have been more
                        than a pleasant young man, if he had not
                        been smitten with the desire of being
                        thought superior in every thing, and of
                        beiing the most admired person in all companies.
                        He had been early flattered with
                        the idea that he was a man of genius; and
                        he imagined, that, as such, he was entitled
                        to be imprudent, wild, and eccentric. He
                        affected singularity, in order to establish
                        his claim to genius. He had considerable 
                        literary talents, by which he weas distinguished
                        at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>; but he was so
                        dreadfully afraid of passing for a pedant,
                        that when he came into the company of
                        the idle and the ignorant, he pretended to
                        disdain every species of knowledge. His
                        <ecda:fauna>cameleon</ecda:fauna> character seemed to vary in different
                        lights, and according to the different 
                        situations, in which he happened to
                        be placed. He could be all things to all
                        men—and to all women—He was supposed
                        to be a favourite with the fair sex;
                        and of all his various excellences and defects,
                        there were none, on which he valued
                        himself so much as his gallantry. he
                        was not profligate; he had a strong sense
                        <pb/>
                        <fw type="pageNum">18</fw>
                        of honour, and quick feelings of humanity;
                        but he was so easily led, or rather
                        so easily excited by his companions, and
                        his companions were now of such a sort,
                        that it was probable he would soon become
                        vicious. As to his connexion with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
                        Delacour</persName>, he would have started with
                        horror at the idea of disturbing the peace
                        of a family; but in her family, he said,
                        there was not peace to disturb: he was
                        vain of having it seen by the world, that
                        he was distinguished by a lady of her wit
                        and fashion, and he did not think it incumbent 
                        on him to be more scrupulous or
                        more attentive to appearance, than her
                        ladyship. By <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> jealousy
                        he was sometimes provoked, sometimes 
                        amused, and sometimes flattered. He was
                        constantly of all her ladyship's parties, in
                        public and private; consequently he saw
                        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> almost every day, and every day
                        he saw her with increasing admiration of
                        her beauty, and with increasing dread of
                        being taken in, to marry a niece of <quote rend="quotes">the

                        to be partners in all the speculations,
                        though their names may not appear in the
                        firm. If he had not been prejudiced by
                        the character of her aunt, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>
                        would have thought <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> an undesigning
                        unaffected girl; but now he suspected
                        her of artifice in every word, look, and
                        motion; and even when he felt himself
                        most charmed by her powers of pleasing,
                        he was most inclined to despise her, 
                        for what he thought such premature
                        proficiency in scientific coquetry. He
                        had not sufficient resolution to keep beyond
                        the sphere of her attraction; but
                        frequently, when he found himself within
                        it, he cursed his folly, and drew back
                        with sudden terrour. His manner towards
                        her was so variable and inconsistent, that
                        she knew not how to interpret it's language.
                        Sometimes she fancied, that with
                        all the eloquence of eyes he said, <said><emph>I
                       adore you</emph>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>;</said> at other times she
                        imagined, that his guarded silence meant
                        to warn her, that he was so entangled by
                        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, that he could not extricate
                        himself from her snares. Whenever
                        this last idea struck her, it excited, in the
                        most edifying manner, her indignation 
                        against coquetry in general, and against
                        <pb/>

                        her ladyship's in particular: she became
                        wonderfully clear-sighted to all the improprieties
                        of her ladyship's conduct. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
                        newly acquired moral sense was so 
                        much shocked, that she actually wrote
                        a full statement of her observations, and 
                        her scruples to her<persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>, concluding 
                        by a request, that she might not
                        remain under the protection of a lady,
                        whose character she could not approve,
                        and whose intimacy might prehaps be
                        injurious to her reputation, if not to her 
                        principles.

                        in a very guarded style; she rebuked
                        her niece very seveely for her imprudence in
                        mentioning <emph>names</emph> in such a manner, in a
                        letter sent by the common post; assured
                        her that her reputation was in no danger;
                        that she hoped no niece of hers would set
                        up for a prude; a character more suspected
                        by men of the world, than even
                        that of a coquette; that the <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0001">person</rs> alluded 
                        to was a perfectly fit chaperon for
                        any young lady to appear with in public,
                        as long as she was visited by the first

                        and her lord, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> should observe,
                        on these dangerous topics, a profound silence,
                        both in her letters and her conversation;
                        tht as long as the lady continued under
                        the protection of <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">her husband</rs>, the world
                        might whisper, but would not speak out;
                        that as to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> own principles,
                        she would be utterly inexcusable, if, after 
                        the education she had received, they
                        could be hurt by any bad examples; that
                        she could not be too cautious in her management 
                        of a man of <rs ref="#clarence_hervey_0001" type="person">―'s</rs> character;
                        that she could have no <emph>serious</emph> cause
                        for jealousy in the quarter she apprehended,
                        as marriage there could not be 
                        the object; and there was such a difference
                        of age, that no permanent influence
                        could probably be oobtained by the lady;
                        that the most certain method for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
                        Portman</persName> to expose herself to the ridicule 
                        of one of the parties, and to the total
                        neglect of the other, would be to betray
                        anxiety or jealousy: that, in short, if she
                        were fool enough to lose her own heart,
                        there would be little chance of her being

                        with respect to her age, &amp;c. and in proportion

                        friend, she ought not to propogate any

                        thought that she had been guilty of treachery,

           extremely out of humour at having been

           the idea that her apellant jurisdiction

        to be sure it will best become tragedy, with

       </p>
       <p>There was an air of extreme vexation
           in <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> countenance, as she
           pronounced these last words, in which evidently
           more was meant than meat the ear.
           Upon many occasions <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> had
           observed, that <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> exercised despotic
           authority over her mistress; and she had
           seen, with surprise, that a lady, who would
           not yield an iota of power to her <rs ref="#delacour_0002" type="person">her husband</rs>,
           submitted herself to every caprice of the
           most insolent of waiting-women. For some
           time <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> imagined that this submission
           was merely an air, as she had seen
           <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">some other fine ladies</ecda:persGroup> proud of appearing
           to be goverened by a favourite maid; but 
           she was soon convinced that <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
           was in possession of some secret, which
           should for ever remain unknown. This
           idea had occurred to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> more
           than once; but never so forcibly as upon
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">30</fw>
           the present occasion. There had always
           been some mystery about her ladyship's
           toilette; at certain hours doors were bolted,
           and it was impossible for any body but
           <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> to obtain admission. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName>
           at first imagined that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           dreaded the discovery of her cosmetic secrets,
           but her ladyship's rogue was so glaring,
           and her pearl powder was so obvious,
           that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was convinced there must be
           some other cause for this toilette secresy.
           There was a little cabinet beyond her bedchamber,
           which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> called her
           boudoir, to which there was an entrance by
           a back stair-case; but no one ever entered
           there but <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>. One night, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, 
           after dancing with great spirit at a
           ball, at her own house, fainted suddenly:
           <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> attended her to her bed-
           chamber, but <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> begged that her lady
           might be left alone with <emph>her</emph>, and she would
           by no means <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> to follow her
           into the boudoir.—All these things <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
           recollected in the space of a few seconds
           as she stood contemplating <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> and
           the dresses. The hurry of getting ready
           for the masquerade, however, dispelled
           these thoughts, and by the time she was
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">31</fw>
           dressed, the idea of what <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           would think of her appearance was uppermost
           in her mind. She was anxious to
           know, whether he would discover her in
           the character of the comic muse. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady
           Delacour</persName> was discontented with her tragic
           attire, and she grew still moure out of humour
           with herself, when she saw <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.           
       </p> 
       <p><said>I protest <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> has made a perfect
       fight of me,</said> said <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0001">her ladyship</rs>, as she
       got into her carriage, <said>and I'm positive
       my dress would become you a million of
       times better than your own.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> regretted that it was too
       late to change.</p>
        <p><said>Not at all too late, my dear,</said> said
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>; <said>never too late for women
         to change their minds, their dress, or their
         lovers. Seriously, you know, we are to
         call at my friend <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>—she sees
         masks too night—I'm quite intimate there;
         I'll make her let me ste up to her own 
         room, where no soul can interrupt us, and
         there we can change our dresses, and <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
         will know nothing of the matter.
         <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott's</persName> a faithful creature; and very
         fond of me; fond of power too—but who
         is not?—we must all hae our faults—one
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">32</fw>
         would not quarrel with such a good creature
         as <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> for a trifle.</said> Then suddenly
         changing her tone, she said <said>not a
         human being will find us out at the masquerade;
         for no one but <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs Freke</persName> knows 
         that we are two muses. <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> 
         swears he should know me in any disguise
         —but I defy him—I shall take special delight
         in puzzling him. <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> has
         told him, in confidence, that I'm to be the
         <persName ref="#widow_brady_0001">widow Brady</persName>, in man's clothes; now that's 
         to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> own character, so <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>
         will make fine confusion.</said>            
        </p>   
        <p>As soon as they got to <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> immediately
            went up stairs to exchange dresses.
            Poor <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, now she felt herself in
            spirits to undertake the comic muse, was
            rather vexed to be obliged to give up her
            becoming character; but there was no resisting 
            the polite energy of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> 
            vanity. Her ladyship ran as quick as
            lightning into a closet within the dressing-
            room, saying to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName> woman</ecda:anonPers>,
            who attempted to follow with—<said>Can I do
            any thing for your ladyship?</said>—<said>No, No,
            no—nothing, nothing—thank ye, thank
            ye,—I want no assistance—I never let any

            body do any thing for me but <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>;</said>
            and she bolted herself in the closet. In a
            few minutes she half opened the door,
            threw out her tragic robes, and cried,
            <said>Here, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, give me yours—
            quick—and let's see whether comedy or
            tragedy will be ready first.</said>            
        </p> 
        <p><said>Lord bless and forgive me,</said> said <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>
        woman</ecda:anonPers>, when <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        at last threw open the door, when she was
        completely dressed—<said>but, if your la'ship
        has not been dressing all this time in that
        den, without any thing in the shape of a

            the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="maid" a-gender="female">waiting-maid's</ecda:anonPers> hand, laughed affectedly
            at her own <emph>whimsicalities</emph>, and declared,
            that she could always dress herself
            better without a glass than with one. All
            this went off admirably well with every
            body but <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>; she could not
            help thinking it extraordinary, that a person
            who was obviously fond of being waited 
            upon, would never suffer any person to
            assist her at her toilette except <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, a

            <fw type="pageNum">34</fw>
            painted in <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> countenance, and for
            a moment she was embarrassed; but she
            soon recovered herself, and endeavoured to
            turn the course of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman's</persName> thoughts,
            by whispering to her some nonsense about
            <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>—A cabalistical name,
            which she knew had the power, when
            pronounced in a certain tone, of throwing
            <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> into confusion.            
        </p>
        <p>The first person they saw, when they
            went into the drawing-room at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            was this very <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who
            was not in a domino. He had laid a wager
            with <ecda:anonPers>one of his acquaintance</ecda:anonPers>, that he could
            perform the part of the <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, such as
            he is seen in <persName ref="#henry_fuseli_1741">Fuseli's</persName> well known picture.
            For this purpose he had exerted much ingenuity
            in the invention and execution of
            a length of coiled skin, which he manœuvred
            with great dexterity, by means of internal
            wires; his grand difficulty had been
            to manufacture the rays that were to come
            from his eyes. He had contrived a set of
            phosphoric rays, which he was certain 
            would charm all the fair <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">daughters of <persName ref="#eve_0001">Eve</persName></ecda:persGroup>.
            He forgot, it seems, that phosphorus could
            not well be seen by candle light. When
            he was just equipped as a <ecda:fauna>serpent</ecda:fauna>, his rays
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">35</fw>
            set fire to part of his <mcr rend="italic">italic</mcr>, and it was
            with the greatest difficulty that he was
            extricated. He escaped unhurt, but his
            <ecda:fauna>serpent's</ecda:fauna> skin was utterly consumed; nothing
            remained, but the melancholy spectacle
            of it's skeleton. He was obliged to
            give up the hopes of shining at the masquerade,
            but he resolved to be at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady Singleton's</persName>,
            that he might meet <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> and
            <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>. The moment that
            the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">tragic and comic muse</ecda:persGroup> appeared, he 
            invoked them with much humour and 
            mock pathos, declaring that he knew not
            which of them could best sing his adventure.
            After a recital of his misfortune
            had entertained the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">company</ecda:persGroup>, and after
            the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" ref="#belinda_portman_0001 #lady_delacour_0001">muses</ecda:persGroup> had performed their parts to the
            satisfaction of the audience, and their own,
            the conversation ceased to be supported in
            masquerade character; <ecda:persGroup>muses and harlequins,
            gipsies and <name>Cleopatras</name></ecda:persGroup>, began to talk
            of their private acfairs, and of the news
            and the scandal of the day. 
        </p>
        <p>A <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">group of gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>, amongst whom 
            was <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, gathered round the
            tragic muse; as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> had hinted
            that he knew she was a person of distinction,
            though he would not tell her name.
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">36</fw>
            He thought that he could not flatter her 
            ladyship more than by abusing <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>.
            After he had exercised his wit for 
            some time, without obtaining from the
            tragic muse one single syllable, he whispered,
            <said><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>, why this unnatural
            reserve? do you imagine, that, 
            through this tragical disguise, I have not
            found you out?</said>
        </p>
        <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#belinda_portman_0001">tragic muse</rs>, apparently absorbed 
            in meditation, vouchsafed no reply.

        <p><said>The devil a word can you get for your

        <p><said>There's danger in flirting,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,
            <said>with an errant flirt of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>

            about that <rs type="person" ref="#belinda_portman_0001">girl</rs>. I have a sort of

        </p>  
        <p><said>Fore-warned is fore-armed,</said> replied

         —<said>There's no less than <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">six of her nieces</ecda:persGroup>,

         winters—Not a one of 'em now, that has

         had she, in the devil's name, to set up 
         with in the world, but a pair of good eyes
         —Her aut, to be sure, taught her the
         use of them early enough—They might
         have rolled to all eternity, before they
         would have rolled me out of my senses;
         but you see, they did <persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache's</persName> business
         —However they are going to part
         now, I hear—<persName ref="#tollemache_0002">Tollemache</persName> was tired of her,
         before the honey-moon was over, as I
         foretold. Then there's the musical girl—
         <persName ref="#joddrell_0001">Joddrell</persName>, who has no more ear than a
         post, went and married her, because he
         had a mind to set up for a connoisseur in

         that he was one.</said>   
        </p>  
        <p>The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> joined in the general
            laugh—The <rs type="person" ref="#belinda_portman_0001">tragic muse</rs> sighed—
        </p>     
        <p><said>Even were she at the <title ref="#sheridan_school">School for Scandal</title>,

            got poor <persName ref="#valleton_0001">Valleton</persName> to fight a duel
            about her place in a country dance, and
            then he was so pleased with himself for

        </p>
         <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> made an effort to change her
             seat, but she was encompassed so, that

         what <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> could do with her I
         often wondered; but she took courage,
         <emph>rouged</emph> her up, set her going as a <emph>dasher</emph>,
         and she dashed herself into <persName ref="#tom_levit_0001">Tom Levit's</persName>

         had a full view of her countenance,
         which was the picture of despair—She

         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> shut and locked the door.
          The room was rather dark, as there was no

          candle, which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> held in her

          <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, as she looked round, saw nothing
          but a confusion of linen rags—vials, some 
          empty, some full, and she perceived that

        held the candle so as to throw the
        light full upon her livid features. Her
        eyes were sunk, her cheeks hollow—no
        trace of youth or beauty remained on her
        death-like countenance, which formed a

        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, when she was left alone, immediately
            opened her shutters, and threw
            up the sash to refresh herself with the
            morning air. She felt excessively fatigued,
            and in the hurry of her mind, she could
            not think of any thing distinctly. She 
            took off her masquerade dress, and went
            to bed, in hopes of forgetting, for a few
            hours, what she felt indelibly impressed
            upon her imagination. But it was in vain
            that she endeavoured to compose herself
            to sleep; her ideas were in too great and
            painful confusion. For some time, whenever
            she closed her eyes, the face and form
            of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, such as she had just
            beheld them, seemed to haunt her; afterwards, 
            the idea of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, and
            the painful recollection of the conversation

            she had seen in the faces of the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">young

            the match-maker. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> mind, however,
            was not yet sufficiently calm to reflect:
            she seemed only to live over again
            the preceding night. At last the strange
            motley figures whish she had seen at the
            masquerade flitted before her eyes, and she
            sunk into an uneasy slumber.

             my life—manners for me, and morals for
             those that like them.—My dear, you will
             be wofully disappointed, if in my story
             you expect any thing like a novel. I once
             heard a general say, that nothing was less
             like a review than a battle; and I can tell
             you, that nothing is more unlike a novel
             than real life. Of all lives, mine has been
             the least romantic. No love in it, but a
             great deal of hate. I was a rich heiress—I
             had, I believe, a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">hundred thousand pounds,
             or more</ecda:commodity>; and twice as many caprices—I
             was handsome and witty—or, to speak
             with that kind of circumlocution which
             is called humility, the world, the partial
             world, thought me a beauty, and a bel-
             esprit.—Having told you my fortune, need
             I add, that I, or it, had <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">lovers</ecda:persGroup> in abundance
             —of all sorts and degrees—not to reckon
             those, it may be presumed, who died of
             concealed passions for me. I had sixteen
             declarations and proposals in form—then

             what in the name of wonder, or of common

             of wonders—what in the name of common 
             sense made me marry <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName>?—
             Why, my dear, you,—no not <emph>you</emph>, but any
             girl who is not used to have a parcel of
             admirers, would think it the easiest thing
             in the world to make her choice; but let
             her judge by what she feels when a dexterous
             mercer or linen-draper produces pretty
             thing after pretty thing—and this is so
             becoming, and that will wear for ever—
             as he swears; but then that's so fashionable
             —the novice stands in a charming perplexity,
             and after examining, and doubting,

             the young lady, in a hurry, pitches

             I thought I should in time break him in.
             —From the specimens you have seen, you
             may guess that I was even then a tolerable
             proficient in the dear art of <mcr rend="italic">self-justification</mcr>
             —I had almost gained my point, just
             broken my lord's heart, when one fair
             morning, I unluckily told his man
             <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, that he knew no more how
             to cut hair than a sheepshearer.—<persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>,
             who is conceit personified, took mortal
             offence at this; and the devil, who is
             always at hand to turn anger into malice,
             put it into <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort's</persName> head, to put it
             into my lord's head, that the world thought
             —<quote rend="italic"><said direct="false">My lady governed him</said></quote>. My lord
             took fire—They say the <ecda:fauna>torpedo</ecda:fauna>, the 
             coldest of cold creatures, sometimes gives
             out a spark—I suppose, when electrified
             with anger.—The next time that innocent
             I insisted upon my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> doing
             or not doing—I forget which—the most
             reasonable thing in the world, my lord
             turns short round, and answers—<said>My
             <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, I am not a man to be governed
             by a wife</said>—And from that time 
             to this, the words <quote>I am not a man to be 
             governed by a wife</quote>—have been written
             in his obstinate face, as all the world who
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">67</fw>
             can read the human countenance may 
             see.—My dear I laugh, but even in the
             midst of laughter there is sadness.—But
             you don't know what it is—I hope you
             never may—to have an obstinate fool for
             a bosom fiend.</p>
             <p>I at first flattered myself, that <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">my
             lord's</rs> was not an inveterate, incurable malady:
             but from his obvious weakness, I
             might have seen that there was no hope;
             for cases of obstinacy are always dangerous
             in proportion to the weakness of the
             patient.—My lord's case was desperate.—
             Kill or cure, was my humane or prudent
             maxim.—I determined to try the <seg ana="#poison">poison 
             of jealousy</seg>, by way of an alternative.—I 
             had long kept it in petto as my ultimate 
             remedy. I fixed upon a proper subject—
             a man with whom I thought that I could
             coquette to all eternity, without any danger
             to myself—a certain <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>—
             as empty a coxcomb as you would wish to
             see.—The world, said I to myself, can
             never be so absurd to suspect <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
             with such a man as this, though
             her lord may, and will, for nothing is too 
             absured for him to believe.—Half my theory
             proved just—that is saying a great deal
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">68</fw>
             for any theory. My lord swallowed the 
             remedy that I had prepared for him, with
             an avidity, and a bonhommie, which it did
             me good to behold—my remedy operated
             beyond my most sanguine expectations.—
             The poor man was cured of his obstinacy,
             and became stark mad with jealousy.—
             THen indeed I had some hopes of him;
             for a madman can be managed, a fool cannot.
             In a month's time, I made him
             quite docile. With a face longer than the
             <rs type="person" ref="#heraclitus_535">weeping philosopher's</rs>, he came to me one
             morning, and assured me, <said direct="false">he would do
             every thing I pleased, provided I would
             consult my own honour, and his, and give
             up <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>.</said></p>   
             <p><quote><said>Give up!</said></quote>—I could hardly forbear
             laughing at the expression.—I replied,
             <said direct="false">that as long as my lord treated me with
             becoming respect, I had never in thought
             or deed given him just cause of complaint;
             but that I was not a woman to be insulted,
             or to be kept, as I had hither to been, in 
             leading-strings, by a husband.</said> My lord,                 
             flattered, as I meant he should be with the
             idea, that it was possible he should be
             suspected of keeping a wife in leading-
             strings, fell to making protestations—<said direct="false">he
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">69</fw>
             hoped his future conduct would prove, &amp;c.</said>
             —Upon this hint, I gave the reins to my
             imagination, and full drive I went into a
             fresh career of extravagance; if I were
             checked, it was <quote rend="italic">an insult</quote>, and I began directly
             to talk of <quote rend="italic">leading-strings</quote>. This riduculous
             game I played successfully enough,
             for some time, till at length, though naturally
             rather slow at calculations, he actually
             discovered that if we lived at the rate of
             <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty thousand</measure> a year, and had only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten 
             thousand</measure> a year to spend, we should, in
             due time, have nothing left. This notable
             discovery he communicated to me one
             morning, after a long preamble. When
             he had finished prosing, I agreed, that it 
             was demonstrably just, that he should retrench
             his expenses; but that it was equally
             unjust and impossible, that I could make
             any reformation in my civil list.—That 
             <distinct type="mentioned">economy</distinct> was a word which I had never
             heard of in my life, till I married his lordsip:
             that, upon second recollection, it 
             was true, I had heard of such a thing as 
             national economy; and that it would be 
             a very pretty, though rather hackneyed
             topic of declamation for a maiden speech
             in the <orgName>house of lords</orgName>. I therefore advised
                 <pb/>
                 <fw type="pageNum">70</fw>
             him to reserve all he had to say upon this
             subject for the noble <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="free">lord upon the wool-
             sack</ecda:anonPers>; nay, I very graciously added, that
             upon this condition, I would go to the
             house myself to give his arguments and
             eloquence a fair hearing, and that I would
             do my best to keep myself away.—This
             was all mighty playful and witty; but it 
             happened that my <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName>, who never
             had any great taste for wit, could not this
             unluckily morning at all relish it. Of course
             I grew angry, and reminded him, with an
             indelicacy which his want of generosity
             justified, that an heiress, who had brought
             a hundred thousand pounds into his family,
             had some right to amuse herself, and that
             it was not my fault if elegant amusements
             were more expensive than others.</p>
             <p>Then came a long criminating and recriminating
            chapter. It was, <said direct="false">My lord,
            your <rs type="properAdjective">Newmarket</rs> blunders.</said>—<said direct="false">My lady,
            your cursed <emph>theatricals</emph></said>—<said direct="false">My lord, I have
            surely a right</said>—<said direct="false">and my lady, I have
            surely as good a right.</said>                 
             </p>
          <p>But, my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, however we
              might pay one another, we could not pay
              all the world with words. In short, after
              running through <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">thousands, and tens of 
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">71</fw>
              thousands</ecda:commodity>, we were actually in distress
              for <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>. Then  came selling of lands
              and I don't know what devices, for raising
              <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, according to the mode of <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="lawyer">lawyers</ecda:persGroup>
              and <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="attorney">attorneys</ecda:persGroup>. It was quite indifferent to 
              me how they got <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, provided they
              did get it.—By what art these <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup>
              raised <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, I never troubled myself to
              inquire; it might have been the black art,
              for any thing I know to the contrary. So I signed
              all the papers they brought to me; and I
              was mighty well pleased to find, that by so
              easy an expidient as writing <quote rend="quotes"><persName ref="#delacour_0001">T. C. H. 
              Delacour</persName></quote>, I could command money at
              will.—I signed, and signed, till at last I 
              was with all due civility informed that my
              signature was no longer worth a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">farthing</ecda:commodity>;
              and when I came to inquire into the cause
              of this phenomenon, I could no wise understand
              what my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer" a-status="free"><persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour's</persName> lawyer</ecda:anonPers>
              said to me. He was a prig, and I had 
              not patience either to listen to him, or to
              look at him. I sent for an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">old uncle</ecda:anonPers> of
              mine, who used to manage all my <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>
              matters before I was married: I put the
              <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> and the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer">lawyer</ecda:anonPers> into a room together
              with their parchments, to fight the matter
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">72</fw>
              out, or to come to a right understanding
              if they could.—The last it seems was quite
              impossible.—In the course of half an hour,
              out comes my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> in such a rage! I
              never shall forget his face—all the bile in
              his body had gotten into it—he had literally 
              no whites to his eyes. <said>My dear
              uncle,</said> said I, <said>What is the matter?—
              Why you are absolutely gold stick in
              waiting.</said>             
          </p>
          <p><said>No matter what I am, child,</said> said the
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers>, <said>I'll tell you what you are with all 
            your wit—a dupe—'tis a shame for a woman
            of your sense to be such a fool, and
            to know nothing of business—and if you
            knew nothing yourself, could you not send
            for me?</said>              
          </p>
         <p><said>I was too ignorant to know that I 
         knew nothing,</said> said I; <choice><sic></sic><corr/></choice>but I will not
         trouble you with all the said Is and said
         hes. I was made to understand, that if 
         <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> were to die the next day, I
         should live a beggar.—Upon this I grew
         serious, as you may imagine. My <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers>
         assured me that I had been grossly imposed
         upon by my lord and his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer">lawyer</ecda:anonPers> ,
         and that I had been swindled out of my 
         senses, and out of my dower. I repeated
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">73</fw>
         all that my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> said, very faithfully, to
         <persName ref="md">lord Delacour</persName>: and all that either he or
         his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="lawyer">lawyer</ecda:anonPers> could furnish out by way of
         answer was, that <quote><said direct="false">necessity had no law</said></quote>.
         Necessity, it must be allowed, though it
         might be the mother of law, was never
         with my lord the mother of invention.
         Having now found out that I had a good
         right to complain, I indulged myself in
         it most gloriously. In short, my dear, we
         had a comfortable family quarrel—love
         quarrels are easily made up—but of money
         quarrels there is no end.—From the moment
         these money quarrels commenced,
         I began to hate <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>—before I
         had only despised him—You can have
         no notion to what meanness extravagance
         reduces men.—I have known <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>
         shirk, and look so shabby, and tell
         so many lies to people about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
         guineas</measure>—a <measure ana="#currency #commodity">hundred guineas</measure>! What do I
         say? About <measure ana="#currency #commodity">twenty</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">ten</measure>, <measure ana="#currency #commodity">five</measure>!—O, my
         dear, I cannot bear the thoughts of it!—
         But I was going on to tell you, that my 
         good <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers>, and all <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">my relations</ecda:persGroup>, quarrelled
         with me for having ruined myself, as 
         they said—but I said, they quarrelled with
         me for fear I should ask them for some of
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">74</fw>
         their <quote rend="quotes" source="#shakespeare_caesar"><hi rend="allcaps">vile trash</hi></quote>.—Accordingly I abused
         and ridiculed them, one and all; and
         for my pains, all my acquaintance said
         that, <said><persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was a woman of a
         vast deal of spirit.</said> 
         </p>
         <p>We were relieved from our money
            embarrassments by the timely death of a
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="free">rich nobleman</ecda:anonPers>, to whose large estate my
            <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> was heir at law. I was intoxicated
            with the idle compliments of all
            my acquaintance, and I endeavoured to
            console myself for misery at home, by
            gayety abroad. Ambitious of pleasing universally,
            I became the worst of slaves—a
            slave to the world.—Not a moment of my
            time was at my own disposal—not one of my
            actions; I may say, not one of my
            thoughts, was my own—I was obliged to
            find things <soCalled rend="quotes">charming</soCalled> every hour, which
            tired me to death: and every day it was
            the same dull round of hypocrisy and dissipation.
            You wonder to hear me speak
            in this manner, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, but one must
            speak the truth sometimes; and this is
            what I have been saying to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>
            continually—continually, for these ten 
            years past. Then why persist in the same
            kind of life, you say?—Why, my dear,
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">75</fw>
            because I could not stop—I was fit for
            this kind of life, and for no other—I could
            not be happy at <emph>home</emph>, for what sort of a
            companion could I have made of <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>?
            By this time he was tired of his 
            <ecda:fauna>horse <name ana="#flora #food">Potato</name></ecda:fauna>, and his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Highflier</name></ecda:fauna>, and
            his <ecda:fauna>horse <name>Eclips</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Goliah</name></ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna><name>Jenny
            Grey</name></ecda:fauna>, &amp;c. and he had taken to hard
            drinking, which soon turned him, as you
            see, quite into a beast.—I forgot to tell
            you, that I had <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">three children</ecda:persGroup> during the
            first five years of my marriage. The first
            was a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">boy</ecda:anonPers>; he was born dead; and my 
            lord, and all his <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">odious relations</ecda:persGroup>, laid the
            blame upon me; because I would not be
            kept prisoner half a year by an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old mother</ecda:anonPers> 
            of his, a vile <name ref="#cassandra_0001">Cassandra</name>, who was always
            prophesying, that my <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">child</ecda:anonPers> would
            not be born alive.—My second child was a
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">girl</ecda:anonPers>, but a poor, dimunitive, sickly thing.
             —It was the fashion at this time for fine
             mothers to suckle their own children—so
             much the worse for the poor brats.—Fine 
             nurses never made fine children. There 
             was a prodigious rout made about the
             matter; a vast deal of sentiment and sympathy,
             and compliments and inquiries; but
             after the novelty was over, I became hear-
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">76</fw>
             tily sick of the business; and at the end
             of about three months my poor <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">child</ecda:anonPers> was
             sick too—I don't much like to think of it
             —it died.—If I had put it out to nurse,
             I should have been thought by my <ecda:persGroup>friends</ecda:persGroup>
             an unnatural mother—but I should have
             saved it's life. I should have bewailed
             the loss of the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">infant</ecda:anonPers> more, if <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed"><persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> 
             relations</ecda:persGroup> and <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">my own</ecda:persGroup> had not made
             such lamentations upon the occasion, that
             I was stunned.—I couldn't or wouldn't
             shed a tear, and I left it to the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old dowager</ecda:anonPers>
             to perform in public, as she wished,
             the part of chief mourner, and to comfort
             herself in private, by lifting up her hands
             and eyes, and railing at me as the most
             insensible of mothers. All this time I
             suffered more than she did; but that is
             what she shall never have the satisfaction 
             of knowing. I determined, that if ever
             I had another child, I would not have the
             barbarity to nurse it myself. Accordingly,
             when my third child, a <rs type="person">girl</rs>, was
             born, I sent it off immediately to the
             country, to a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="nurse">stout, healthy, broad-faced
             nurse</ecda:anonPers>, under whose care it grew and flourished;
             so that at three years old, when it
             was brought back to me, I could scarcely
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">77</fw>
             believe the chubby little thing was my own
             child. The same reasons, which convinced
             me I ought not to nurse my own child,
             determined me <foreign xml:lang="fr">à plus forte raison</foreign>, not to
             undertake it's education. <persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName>
             could not bear the child because it was not
             a boy. The girl was put under the care 
             of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="governess">governess</ecda:anonPers>, who plagued my heart
             out with her airs and tracasseries for
             three or four years; at the end of which
             time, as she turned out to be <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName>
             mistress in form, I was obliged—in 
             form—to beg she would leave my house,
             and I put her pupil in better hands, I
             hope, at a celebrated academy for young
             ladies. There she will, at any rate, be
             better instructed than she could be at 
             home.—I beg your pardon, my dear, for 
             this digression on nursing and schooling,
             but I wanted only to explain to you why
             it was, that when I was weary of the 
             business, I still went on in a course of 
             dissipation. You see I had nothing at 
             home, either in the shape of husband or
             children, to engage my affections. I believe
             it was this <quote rend="quotes" source="#cowper_god">aching void</quote> in my heart,
             which made me, after looking abroad some
             time for a bosom friend, take such a pro-
             <pb/>

             digious fancy to <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>. She was
             just then coming into fashion—she struck
             me the first time I met her, as being
             downright ugly; but there was a wild
             oddity in her countenance which made
             one stare at her, and she was delighted to
             be stared at—especially by me—so we
             were mutually agreeable to each other—I
             as starer, and she as staree. <persName ref="#harriot_freke">Harriot Freke</persName>
             had, without comparison, more assurance
             than any man or woman I ever saw. She
             was downright brass—but of the finest
             kind—<rs type="properAdjective">Corinthian</rs> brass—She was one of
             the first who brought what I call <mcr rend="italic">harum 
             scarum</mcr> manners into fashion. I told you
             that she had assurance—<emph>impudence</emph> I
             should have called it, for no other word is
             strong enough—Such things as I have
             heard <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> say!—You will not
             believe it; but her conversation at first absolutely
             made me, like an old-fashioned
             fool, wish I had a fan to play with. But
             to my astonishment, all this <emph>took</emph> surprisingly
             with a set of fashionable young men.

             —allow me to speak of myself in the style
             in which the newspaper writers talk of me
             —<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour's</persName> sprightly elegance was
             but pal—not to say <emph>faded</emph> pink, compared 
             with the scarlet of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke's</persName> dashing
             audacity. As my rival, she would on certain
             ground have beaten me hollow; it was
             therefore good policy to make her my 
             friend. We joined forces, and nothing
             could stand against us. But I have no
             right to give myself credit for good policy 
             in forming this intimacy; I really followed 
             the dictates of my heart of my imagination.
             There was a frankness in <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName>
             manner, which I mistook for artlessness of
             character. She spoke with such unbounded
             freedom on certain subjects, that I gave
             her credit for unbounded sincerity on all
             subjects. She had the talent for making the
             world believe <emph>that</emph> virtue to be invulnerable
             by nature, which disdained the common
             outworks of art for it's defence. I, 
             amongst other, took it for granted, that
             the woman who could make it her sport to
             <quote source="#pope_lady">touch the brink of all we hate</quote>, must have
             a stronger head than other people.—I
             have since been convinced, however, of my

             mistake.—I am persuaded that few can
             touch the brink without tumbling headlong
             down the precipice—Don't apply this, my
             dear, <emph>literally</emph>, to the person of whom we
             were speaking. I am not base enough to
             betray her secrets, however I may have
             been provoked by her treachery. Of her
             character and history you shall hear
             nothing, but what is necessary for my own
             justification. The league of amity between
             us was scarcely ratified, before my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord
             Delacour</persName> came with his wise remonstrating

             for <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>. I, of course, repeated
             her every word which had passed between

             cause, that I was downright ashamed of
             myself, and purely to prove my innocence,
             I determined, upon the first convenient
             opportunity, to renew my intimacy with
             the colonel. The opportunity which I so
             ardently desired of redeeming my independence,
             was not long wanting.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,

             regiment; he returned with a <seg ana="#injury">would 
             across his forehead, and a black fillet
             which made him look something more
             like a hero, and ten times more like a 
             coxcomb, than ever.</seg>—He was in fashion
             at all events, and amongst other ladies,
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>—odious <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>!
             smiled upon him.—The Colonel, however,
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">82</fw>
             had taste enough to know the difference 
             between smile and smile; he laid himself
             and his <ecda:flora>laurels</ecda:flora> at my feet, and I carried
             him and them about in triumph. Wherever
             I went, especially to <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>,
             envy and scandal joined hands to attack 
             me, and I heard wondering and whispering
             wherever I went. I had no object in view
             but to provoke my husband, therefore conscious
             of the purity of my intentions, it
             was my delight to brave the opinion of the
             wondering world. I gave myself no concern
             about the effect my coquetry might
             have upon the object of this flirtation—
             poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>!—heart, I took it for granted,
             he had none—how should a coxcomb
             come by a heart?—Vanity I knew he
             had in abundance, but this gave me
             no alarm, as I thought that if it should
             ever make him forget himself—I mean
             forget what was due to me—I could, by
             one flash of my wit, strike him to the 
             earth, or blast him for ever. One night
             we had been together at <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>
             —she amongst other good things, kept a

             —Be that as it may, I lost an immensity
             of money, and it was my pride to lose

             with as much gayety as any body else
             could win; so I was, or appeared to be
             in uncommonly high spirits, and <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>
             had his share of my good humour. We
             left <placeName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge's</placeName> together early; about
             half past one. As the colonel was going
             to hand me to my carrige, a smart-looking
             young man, as I thought, came up
             close to the coach door, and stared me
             full in the face: I was not a woman to be
             disconcerted at such a thing as this, but
             I really was startled when the young fellow
             jumped into the carriage after me: I
             thought he was mad: I had only courage
             enough to scream.—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> seized hold
             of the intruder to drag him out, and out 
             he dragged the youth, exclaiming in a
             high tone—<said>What is the meaning of all
             this, sir?—Who the devil are you?—My
             name's <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>:—who the devil are
             you?</said> The answer to this was a convulsion
             of laughter. By the laugh, I knew
             it to be <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>.—<said>Who am I!
             only a <name>Freke</name>!</said> cried she—<said>shake hands.</said>
             I gave her my hand, into the carriage 
             she sprang, and desired the Colonel to
             follow her: <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> laughed, we all
             laughed, and drove away. <said>Where do

             <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> was mad with spirits, and so

             in his silly way, laughed incessantly, and

             when the 'larum of <persName ref="#harriot_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> voice ceased
             for an instant, I was struck with the strange

             Not upon the stones, I'm sure;</said> said I;
             and putting my head out of the window, I
             saw we were beyond the turnkpike.—<said>The

             said I; and was going to pull the

             of it.—<said>The man is going very right,</said>
             said she, <said>I've told him where to go.—

             <fw type="pageNum">85</fw>
             To this I agreed, and laughed for fear

             my merry companions were infinitely diverted
             with my perplexity and impatience,
             more especially, as I believe, in spite of
             all my efforts I grew rather graver than 
             usual. We went on to the end of <placeName>Sloane-
             street</placeName>, and quite out of town; at last we
             stopped.—It was dark, the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">footman's</ecda:anonPers> flambeau
             was out, I could only just see by the

             odd looking house.—The house door
             opened, and an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old woman</ecda:anonPers> appeared with
             a lantern in her hand.             
         </p>
         <p><said>Where is this farce, or freak, or whatever
         you call it, to end?</said> said I, as <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>
         pulled me into the dark passage along
         with her.

         <p><said xml:id="s009" prev="#s008">Alas! my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady

         —As the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old woman</ecda:anonPers> and her miserable

             <fw type="pageNum">86</fw>
         some German <emph>horrifications</emph>, but I heard

         <emph>spoil-sport</emph> she had ever seen, and she
         whispered to me—<said>the reason he laughs
         is, because he is afraid of our suspecting
         the truth of him, that he believes <foreign xml:lang="fr">toute de

         that.</said>—The <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">old woman</ecda:anonPers>, whose cue I

         the top of a narrow staircase, and pointing
         to a tall figure, completely enveloped
         in fur, left us to our fate. I will not 
         trouble you with a pompous description
         of all the mummery of the scene, my dear,
         as I despair of being able to frighten
         you out of your wits. I should have been
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">87</fw>
         downright angry with <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> for
         bringing me to such a place, but that I
         knew women of the first fashion had been 
         with <persName ref="#mrs_w_0001">Mrs. W―</persName>before us—some in
         somber sadness—some by way of frolic—
         So as there was no fear of being ridiculous,
         there was no shame, you know, and
         my conscience was quite at ease. <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>
         had no conscience, so she was always 
         at ease; and never more so than in male
         atire, which she had been told became 
         her particularly. She supported the character 
         of a young rake with such spirit
         and <emph>truth</emph>, that I am sure no common
         conjurer could have discovered any thing
         feminine about her. She rattled on with
         a set of nonsensical questions; and among
         other things, she asked, <said>How soon will

         —<said>True,</said> answered the oracle—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel
         Lawless</persName> laughed; I was angry; and
         the colonel would have been quiet, for he
         was a gentleman, but there was no such 
         thing as managing <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>, who, though
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">88</fw>
         she had laid aside the modesty of her own

         second husband?</said> cried she. <said>You'll not
         offend any of the present company by
         naming the man.</said>—<said>Her second husband
         I cannot name,</said> replied the oracle, <said>but
         let her beware of a <name>Lawless</name> lover.</said> <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Mrs

         by her, triumphed over me without mercy;
         I may say, without shame!—Well
         my dear, I am in a hurry to have done 
         with all this: though I <quote rend="quotes"><hi rend="italic">doated upon
         folly</hi></quote>, yetI was terrified at the thoughts
         of any thing worse. The idea of a divorce,
         the public brand of shameful life,
         shocked me, in spite of all my real and all
         my assumed levity. O that I had, at this
         instant, dared to <emph>be myself</emph>! But my fear
         of ridicule was greater than my fear of
         vice.—<said>Bless me, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
         whispered <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>, as we left this 
         house, <said>what can make you in such a 
         desperate hurry to get home?—You gape
         and fidget—one might think you had
         never sat up a night before in your life.—
         I verily believe you are afraid to trust
         yourself with us.—Which of us are you
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">89</fw>
         afraid of; <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, or me, or <emph>yourself</emph>!</said>
         —There was a tone of contempt in the
         last words, which piqued me to the quick;
         and, however strange it may seem, I was
         now anxious to convince <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> that
         I was not afraid of myself—False shame
         made me act, as if I had no shame—You
         would not suspect me of knowing any
         thing of false shame, but depend upon it,
         my dear, many, who appear to have as
         much assurance as I have, are secretly it's
         slaves.—I moralize, because I am come to
         a part of my story, which I should almost
         be glad to omit—but I promised you, that
         there should be no sinse of omission. It
         was light, but not broad daylight, when
         we got to <placeName>Knightsbridge</placeName>. <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> encouraged,
         for I cannot deny it, by the 
         levity of my manner, was in higher and more familiar
         spirits than I ever saw him.—<persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Mrs. Freke</persName>
         desired me to set her down at her <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">sister's</ecda:anonPers>   
         who lived in <placeName>Grosvenor Place</placeName>.—I did so,
         and I beg you to believe, that I was in an
         agony to get rid of my colonel at the 
         same time; but you know, I could not,
         before <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName>, absolutely say to
         him—<said>Get out!</said>—Indeed, to tell things
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">90</fw>
         as they were, it was scarcely possible to
         guess by my manner, that I was under
         any anxiety—I acted my part so well, or
         so ill.—As <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> jumped out of
         the coach, a <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crowed in the area of
         her <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">sister's</ecda:anonPers> house, <said>There!</said> cried <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>,
         <said>do you hear the <ecda:fauna>cock</ecda:fauna> crow, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour?</persName>—</said>
         <said>Now it's to be hoped your fear
         of goblins is over—else I would not be
         so cruel, as to leave the pretty dear all
         alone.</said>—<said>All alone,</said> answered I—<said>your
         friend the colonel is much obliged to you
         for making nobody of him.</said>—<said>My friend
         the cololnel,</said> whispered <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>, leaning
         with her bold masculine arms folded upon
         the coach door—<said>My friend the colonel is
         much obliged to me, I'm sure, for remembering  
         what the cunning, or the knowing
         woman told us just now, that you and he are
         —or are to be—one and the same person.
         So when I said I left you alone, I
         was not guilty of a bull, was I?</said>—I had
         the grace to be heartily ashamed of this
         speech, and called out in utter confusion
         —<said>to <placeName>Berkeley Square</placeName>.―But where shall 
         I set you down, colonel<sic>!</sic>—<persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>, good
         morning—don't forget you are in man's 
         clothes.</said>—I did not dare to repeat the 
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">91</fw>  
         question of <said>where shall I set you down,
         colonel?</said> at this instant, because <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName>
         gave me such an arch sneering look, as
         much as to say—still afraid of yourself!—
         We drove on—I'm persuaded that the 
         confusion which, in spite of all my efforts,
         broke through my affected levity, encourated 
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was natrually a coxcomb
         and a fool, to believe that I was
         actually his—else he never could have
         been so insolent.—In short, my dearh, before
         we had got through the turnpike gate,
         I was downright obliged to say to him—
         <said>Get out!</said>—which I did with a degree 
         of indignation, that quite astonished him.
         —He muttered something about ladies
         knowing their minds—and I own, though
         I went off with flying colours, I secretly
         blamed myself as much as I did him, and 
         I blamed <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> more than I did either.
         —I sent for her the next day as soon as I 
         could, to consult her. She expressed such
         astonishment, and so much concern, at 
         this catastrophe of our night's frolic, and
         blamed herself with so many oaths, and
         execrated <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> for a coxcomb so much
         to the ease and satisfaction of my conscience,
         that I was confirmed in my good
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">92</fw>
         opinion of her, and indeed felt for her the
         most lively affection and esteem—for observe,
         with me esteem ever followed affection,
         instead of affection following esteem.
         —Wo be to all, who in morals preposterously
         put the cart before the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>!—But
         to proceed with my history—all fashionable
         historians stop to make reflections,
         supposing that no one else can have the 
         sense to make any. My <emph>esteemed</emph> friend
         agreed with me, that it would be best for 
         all parties concerned to hush up this business;
         that as <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was going out of
         town in a few days, to be elected for a
         borough, we should get rid of him in the
         best way possible, without <quote source="#johnson_words">more last
         words</quote>—that he had been punished sufficiently
         on the spot, and that to punish
         twice for the same offence, once in private
         and once in public, would be contrary to
         the laws of <name>Englishmen</name> and <name>Englishwomen</name>,
         and in my case would be contrary to
         the evident dictates of prudence—because
         I could not complain, without calling up
         <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> to call <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> out—This
         I could not do without acknowledging
         that his lordship had been in the right,
         in warning me about his <quote rend="italic">honour and my
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">93</fw>
         own</quote>, which old phrase I dreaded to hear
         for the ninety-ninth time; besides, <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord
         Delacour</persName> was the last man in the world
         I should have chosen for my knight—
         though unluckily he was my lord—Besides,
         all things considered, I thought the
         whole story might not tell so well in the 
         world for me, tell it which way I would
         —We therefore agreed, that it would be
         most expedient to hold our tongues. We 
         took it for granted, that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> would
         hold his, and as for my people, they knew
         nothing, I thought, or if they did, I was
         sure of them. How the thing got abroad,
         I could not at the time conceive, though
         now I am well acquainted with the baseness
         and treachery of the woman I called
         my friend.—The letter was known and
         talked of every where the next day, and
         the story was told especially at the odious
         <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName>, with such exaggerations
         as drove me almost mad.—I was
         enraged, inconceivably enraged with <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>,
         from whom I imagined the reports originated.

           myself upon the occasion as became a fine
           lady.—There were some things, however,
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">97</fw>
           I could hardly stand.—You must know
           that <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, fool and coxcomb as he
           was, had some magnanimity, and showed
           it—as some people do from whom it is
           least expected—on his deathbed. The
           last words he said, were <said><persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>

           <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>.</said>—This he said to his mother
            —who—to complete my misery—is
            one of the most respectable women in
            <placeName>England</placeName>, and was most desperately fond
            of <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, who was an only son.—She
            never has recovered his loss.—Do you
            remember asking me who a tall elderly
            lady in mourning was, that you saw getting 
            into her carriage one day, at <placeName><placeName>South-
            Audley-street</placeName> chapel</placeName>, as we passed by in
            our way to the park?—That was <persName ref="#lawless_0002">lady
            Lawless</persName>—I believe I didn't answer you
            at the time.—I meet her every now and
            then—to me a spectre of dismay.—But
            as <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> said, certainly such a
            man as poor <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName> was a useless being
            in society, however he may be regretted
            by a doating mother.—We should see
            things in a philosophical light if we can.—
            I should not have suffered half as much as
            I did, if he had been a man of a stronger

            understanding; but he was a poor, vain,
            weak creature, that I actually drew on
            and duped with my own coquetry, whilst
            all the time I was endeavouring only to
            plague <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>.—I was punished
            enough by the airs his lordship doubly 
            gave himself, upon the strength of his
            valour and his judgment—they roused me
            completely—and I blamed him with all
            my might, and got an enormous party of
            <ecda:persGroup>my friends</ecda:persGroup>, I mean my acquaintance,
            to run him down full cry, for having
            fought for me—It was absurd—It was
            rash—It was want of proper confidence
            in his wife; <mcr rend="italic">thus we</mcr> said:—<persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord

            <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. I embraced the first opportunity
            I met with of retaliation.—You
            must know that <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, beside
            being a great faro-player, was a great
            dabbler in politics; for she was almost as
            fond of power as of money: she talked
            loud and fluently, and ahd, somehow or
            other, partly by intriguing, partly by relationship,
            connected herself with <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="mp">some of
            the leading men in <orgName>parliament</orgName></ecda:persGroup>.—There

            there next to <placeName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</placeName>, and being

            table, the <ecda:persGroup ref="#luttridge_0001 #luttridge_0002"><name>Luttridges</name></ecda:persGroup> were popular enough.
            —At the first news of an election, out

            new scene for me; but I piqued myself
            on the versatility of my talents, and I laid
            myself out to please all the squires, and, 
            what was more difficult, all the squires'
            ladies in <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. I was ambitious to
            have it said of me, <said>that I was the finest
            figure that ever appeared upon a canvass.</said>
            —O ye <name>*****shireians</name>, how hard did I
            work to obtrain your praise!—All that the
            combined force of vanity and hatred could
            inspire, I performed, and with success.
            You have but little curiosity, I presume,
            to know how many <measure>hogsheads</measure> of <ecda:food ana="#commodity">port</ecda:food>

            luckily, a handsome legacy left me for my
            spirit, by an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">uncle</ecda:anonPers> who died six weeks
            before the election, enabled us to sustain
            the expence of my apotheosis.—The day
            of election came—<persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> and I
            made our appearance on the hustings,
            dressed in splendid party uniforms; and
            before us, our knights and squires held
            <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">two enormous panniers full of ribands and
            cockades</ecda:commodity>; which we distributed with a
            grace that won all hearts, if not all votes.
            —<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> thought the panniers
            would carry the election; and forthwith
            she sent off an express for a pair of pannier
            twice as large as ours. I took out
            my pencil, and drew a caricature of <quote>the <ecda:fauna>ass</ecda:fauna> 
            and her panniers</quote>: wrote an epigram at
            the bottom of it; and the epigram and
            the caricature were soon in the hands of
            half <placeName>*****shire</placeName>. The verses were as bad
            as impromptus usually are, and the drawing
            was not much better than the writing,
            but the <emph>good will</emph> of the critics supplied
            all my deficiencies; and never was more
            praise bestowed upon the pen of <persName ref="#edmund_burke_1729">Burke</persName>,
            or the pencil of <persName ref="#joshua_reynolds_1723">Reynolds</persName>, than was lavished
            upon me by my honest friends.

              <fw type="pageNum">101</fw>
            —My dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, if you will not
             quarrel with the quality, you may have
             what quantity of praise you please.—
             <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I hoped and expected,
             was beyond measure enraged at the
             sight of the caricature and epigram.—
             She was, besides being a gamester and
             a politician—what do you think?—an
             excellent shot!—She wished, she said, to
             be a man, that she might be qualified to
             take proper notice of my conduct.—The
             same kind friends who shewed her my 
             epigram, repeated to me her observation
             upon it. <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> was at my elbow,
             and offered to take any <emph>message</emph> I might
             think proper to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>. I scarcely
             thought her in earnest, till she added,
             that the only way left, now-a-days, for a
             woman to distinguish herself, was by
             spirit; as every thing else was grown
             <said>cheap and vulgar in the eyes of men</said>—
             That she knew <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">one of the cleverest young
             men</rs> in <placeName>England</placeName>, and a man of fashion
             into the bargin, who was just going to
             publish a treatise <title>upon the Propriety
             and Necessity of Female Duelling</title>; and
             that he had demonstrated beyond a possibility
             of doubt, that civilized society could
              <pb/>
              <fw type="pageNum">102</fw>
             not exist half a century longer without
             this necessary improvement. I had prodigious 
             deference for the masculine superiority,
             as I thought it, of <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot's</persName> understanding.
             She was a philosopher, and
             a fine lady—I was only a fine lady—I had
             never fired a pistol in my life; and I was
             a little inclined to cowardice; but <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> 
             offered to bet any wager upon the
             steadiness of my hand, and assured me
             that I should charm all beholder in male
             attire—In short, as my second, if I would
             furnish her with proper credentials, she
             swore she would undertake to furnish me
             with clothes, and pistols, and courage, and
             every thing I wanted.—I sat down to pen
             my challenge. When I was writing it,
             my hand did not tremble <emph>much</emph>—not more
             than my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> always does.
             The challenge was very prettily worded—
             I believe I can repeat it.

             In the evening, <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot</persName> and I

              I could not forbear giving her a hint,
              which I thought might tend to preserve
              the <rs type="person" ref="george_III_england_1738">king's</rs> peace, and the peace of the

              a billion of times at least, as we were 
              going to the ground; and I had my presentiments,

              poetic justice—but poetic jutice, and all
              other sorts of justice, went clear out of

          <p>Life is a tragicomedy!—Though the
             critics will allow of no such thing in their 
             books, it is a true representation of what
             passes in the world; and of all lives,
             mine has been the most grotesque mixture,
             or alternation, I should say, of tragedy
             and comedy.—All this is a-propos
             to something I have not told you yet.

             not used to priming and loading—my

             recoiled, and I received a blow on my

              received the blow, much leisure for lamentation!
              for I had scarcely discharged my

              or at least our disgrace—a

              The person was clad in splendind regimentals,
              and he was armed with a long

              in the midst of the noise, could not without
              difficulty make his voice heard; but at

           <p>The only thing I had to console me
               for all this, was <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> opinion,
               that I looked better in man's clothes,

               was charmed with my spirit and grace,
               but he had not leisure at that time to
               attach himself seriously to me, or to any
               thing.—He was then, I guess, about
               nineteen or twenty; he was all vivacity,
               persumption, and paradox; he was enthusiastic
               in support of his opinions, but
               he was at the same time the most candid
               man in the world; for there was no set 
               of tenets which could be called exclusively
               his; he adopted in liberal rotation
               every possible absurdity, and to do him
               justice, defended each in it's turn with the
               most ingenious arguments that could be
               devise,d and with a flow of words which
               charmed the ear if not the sense.—His
               essay on female duelling was a most extraordinary
               performance; it was handed
               about in manuscript till it was worn out,
               he talked of publishing it, and dedicating 
               it to me. However, this scheme, amongst
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">116</fw>
               a million of others, he <emph>talked of</emph>, but never
               put into execution.—Luckily for him,
               many of his follies evaporated in words.—
               I saw but little either of him or his follies
               at this time.—All I knew about him is,
               that after he had lost his bet of a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
               guineas</measure> as a <ecda:fauna>pig</ecda:fauna>-driver, by his knight
               errantry in rescuing the female duellists
               from a <ecda:persGroup>mob</ecda:persGroup>, he wrote a very charming
               copy of verses upon the occasion; and
               that he was so much provoked by the
               stupidity of <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="soldier">some of his brother officers</ecda:persGroup>,
               who could not understand the verses, that
               he took a disgust to the army, and sold
               his commission. He set out upon a tour
               to the continent, and I returned with <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot
               Freke</persName> to <placeName>London</placeName>, and forgot the existence
               of such a person as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
               for three or four years.—Unless people
               can be of some use, or unless they are
               actually present, let them be ever so 
               agreeable or meritorious, we are very apt
               to forget them.—One grows strangely
               selfish by living in the world.—'Tis a
               perfect cure for romantic notions of gratitude,
               and love, and so forth.—If I had
               lived in the country in an old manor
               house, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> would have

               doubtless reigned paramount in my imagination,
               as the deliverer of my life, &amp;c.
               But in <placeName>London</placeName> one has no time for thinking
               of deliverers. And yet what I did
               with my time I cannot tell you—'Tis
               gone, and no trace left—One day after
               another went, I know not how—Had I
               wept for every day I lost, I'm sure I
               should have cried my eyes out before this
               time.—If I had enjoyed any amusement
               in the midst of this dissipation, it would
               all have been very well; but I declare to
               you in confidence, I have been tired to
               death.—Nothing can be more monotonous
               than the life of a hacknied fine lady
               —I question whether a <ecda:fauna>dray-horse</ecda:fauna>, or a
               <ecda:fauna>horse in a mill</ecda:fauna>, would willingly exchange
               places with one—if they could know as 
               much of the matter as I do.—You are
               surprised at hearing all this from me. My 
               dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, how I envy you!—You are
               not yet tired of every thing.—<mcr rend="italic">The world</mcr>
               has still the gloss of novelty for you—But
               don't expect that can last above a season.
               —My first winter was certainly entertaining
               enough.—One begins with being 
               charmed with the bustle and glare, 
               and what the <name>French</name> call <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">spectacle</foreign>; this is

               and <placeName>Ranelagh</placeName>, and all those places,
               for their own sakes.—Soon, very soon we 
               go out to see people, not things.—Then
               we grow tired of seeing people—
               and then we go o out, merely because we
               can't stay at home.—A dismal story, and
               a true one.—Excuse me fore showing you
               the simple truth; well dressed falsehood
               is a personage much more <emph>presentable</emph>.—
               I am now come to an epoch in my history,
               in which there is a dearth of extraordinary
               events—What shall I do?—Shall I
               invent—I would if I could—but I cannot
               —Then I must confess to you, that during
               these last four years I should have died
               of ennui if I had not been kept alive by
               my hatred of <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, and of my

               most—O, yes I do—I certainly hate <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs.
               Luttridge</persName> the most—for a woman can
               always hate a woman more than she can 
               hate a man, unless she has been in love
               with him—which I never was with poor

               <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> the most—I cannot count
               the number of extravagant things I have
               done on purpose to eclipse her.—We have
               had rival routs, rival concers, rival galas,
               rival theatres—she has cost me more than
               <emph>she's</emph> worth—But then I certainly have
               mortified her once a month at least.—
               My hatred to <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, my dear,
               is the remote cause of my love for you
               —for it was the cause of my intimace
               with your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>—<persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>
               is really a clever woman, she knows
               how to turn the hatred of all her friends
               and acquaintance to her own advantage.
               —To serve lovers, is a thankless office,
               compared with that of serving <emph>haters</emph>—
               polite haters I mean.—It may be dangerous,
               for aught I know, to interpose in the 
               quarrels of those who hate their neighbours,
               not only with all their souls, but
               with all their strength–the barbarians
               fight it out, kiss, and are friends.—The
               quarrels which never come to blows are
               safer for a go-between; but even these
               are not to be compared to such as never
               come to words—Your true silent hatred is
               that which lasts for ever. The moment it 
               was known that <persName ref="#luttridge">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> and I had
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">120</fw>
               came to the resolution never to speak to
               one another, your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName> began to
               minister to my hatred so, that she made
               herself quite agreeable. She, one winter,
               gave me notice that my adversary had
               set her heart upon having a magnificent
               entertainment, on a particular day. On 
               that day, I determined, of course, to have
               a rival gala.–<ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> maid</ecda:anonPers> had a
               lover, a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">gardener</ecda:anonPers>, who lived at <placeName>Chelsea</placeName>;
               and the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">gardener</ecda:anonPers> had an <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>, which was
               expected soon to blow. Now, a plant that
               blows but once in a hundred years is
               worth having. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">gardener</ecda:anonPers> intended to
               make a public exhibition of ot; by which
               he expected to gain about a <measure ana="#commodity #currency">hundred 
               guineas</measure>.—Your <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="maid"><persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>'s maid</ecda:anonPers> got
               it from him, for me, for <measure ana="#currency #commodity">fifty</measure>; and I had
               it whispered about, that an <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> in full
               blow, would stand in the middle of one of
               <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> supper tables.—The difficulty 
               was to make <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> fix upon
               the very day we wanted; for you know 
               we could not possibly put off the blowing
               of our <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>.—Your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName> managed
               the thing admirably, by m eans of
               a <emph>common friend</emph>, who was not a suspected
               person with the <ecda:persGroup ref="#luttridge_0001 #luttridge_0002"><name>Luttridges</name></ecda:persGroup>—in short, my
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">121</fw>
               dear, I gained my point—every body
               came from <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge's</persName> to me, or to
               my <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>.—She had a prodigiously fine
               supper, but scarcely a soul staid with her;
               they all came to see, what could be seen
               but once in a hundred years.—Now, the
               <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora>, you know, is of a cumbersome
               height for a supper ornament.—My
               saloon luckily has a dome, and under the
               dome we placed it.—Round the huge
               china vase in which it was planted, we
               placed the most beautiful, or rather the 
               most expensive, <ecda:flora>hot-house plants</ecda:flora> we could 
               procure.—After all, the <ecda:flora>aloe</ecda:flora> was an ugly 
               thing—but it answered my purpose—it
               made <persName ref="#luttridg_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>, as I am credibly informed,
               absolutely weep with vexation.—
               I was excessively obliged to your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt
               Stanhope</persName>, and I assured her, that if ever
               it were in my power, she might depend 
               upon my gratitude.—Pray, when you
               write, repeat the same thing to her, and
               tell her, that since she has introduced <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda
               Portman</persName> to me, I am a hundred times
               more obliged to her than ever I was before.
               —But to proceed with my important
               history.—I will not tire you, with fighting 
               over again all my battles, in my seven

               <fw type="pageNum">122</fw>
               years' war with <persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName>.—I believe
               love is more to your taste than hatred;
               therefore I will go on as fast as possible,
               to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> return from his travels.
               —He was much improved by them;
               or at least I thought so, for he was heard 
               to declare, that after all he had seen in
               <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName>, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> appeared
               to him the most charming woman, <emph>of her

               piqued me, and I spared no pains to make
               him forget them—a stupid man cannot
               readily persuaded out of his senses—
               what he sees, he sees, and neither more
               nor less—but 'tis the easiest thing in the 
               world to catch hold of a man of genius—
               you have nothing to do but appeal from 
               his senses to his imagination; and then
               he sees with the eyes of his imagination,
               and hears with the ears of his imagination;
               and then no matter what the age, beauty,
               or wit of the charmer may be—no matter 
               whether it be <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> or <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda

               know with me, that is out of the question;
               all I ask or wish for is admiration.

           <p><said>Oh!—I am, sometimes,</said> resumed she,
            <said>as you see, in terrible pain.—For two
             years after I gave myself that blow with
             the pistol, I neglected the warning twinges
             that I felt from time to time.—at last
             I was terrified.—<persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was the only
             person to whom I mentioned my fears,
             and she was profoundly ignorant.—She
             flattered me with false hopes, till, alas! it
             was in vain to doublt of the nature of my 
             complaint.—Then she urged me to consult 
             a physician—that I would not do—I
             could not—I never will consult a physician
             —I would not for the universe have my
             situation known.—You stare—you cannot
             enter into my feelings. Why, my dear, if
             I lose admiration, what have I left?—
             Would you have me live upon pity?—
             Consider, what a dreadful thing it must
             be to me, who have no friends, no family,
             to be confined to a sick room—a sick bed
             —'tis what I must come to at last—but
             not yet—not yet—I have fortitude—I
             should despise myself if I had no species
             of merit—besides, it is still some occupa-

             tion to me, to act my part in public—and
             bustle, noise, nonsense, if they do not
             amuse, or interest me, yet they stifle reflection
             —may you never know what it is to
             feel remorse!—The idea of that poor
             wretch, <persName ref="#lawless_0001">Lawless</persName>, whom I actually murdered,
             as much as if I had shot him,
             haunts me whenever I am alone—it is now
             between eight and nine years since he
             died, and I have lived ever since in a
             constant course of dissipation—but it won't
             do—Conscience! conscience will be heard.
             —Since my health has been weakened, I
             believe I have acquired more conscience
             —I really think that my stupid lord, who
             has neither ideas nor sensations, except
             when he is intoxicated, is a hundred times
             happier than I am—But I will spare you,

             It is, however, a great relief to open my

              sticking knee deep in the mud; a ridiculous,

             —The widow was dumb—I insisted upon
             knowing the cause of this sudden loss of

             believing that I led his wife, instead of

             enjoyed my astonishment and my rage—
             so I concealed both, with all possible presence
             of mind.—He went on overwhelming

             from him, simply wishing him a good
             journey, and as much family piece as

             the comic muse a full hour afterward,
             to convince him, that all their combined
             malice would fail to break my spirit—in

               —and contempt.—Astonishment

               contempt for her donduct.—To these emotions
               succeeded the recollection of the
               promise which she had made, not to leave
               her in her last illness at the mercy of an
               insolent attendant. This promise <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
               thought of with terror—she dreaded
               the sight of sufferings which she knew
               must end in death—she dreaded the sight 
               of that affected gaity, and of that real
               levity which so ill became the condition
               of a dying woman.—She trembled at the
               idea of being under the guidance of one
               who was so little able to conduct herself;
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">132</fw>
               and she could not help blaming her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt
               Stanhope</persName> severely, for placing her in such
               a perious situation. It was obvious that
               some of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> histrory must have
               been known to <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>; and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
               the more she reflected, was the more surprised  at her aunt's ahving
               chosen such a chaperon for a young woman
               just entering into the world. When
               the understanding is suddenly roused and
               forced to exert itself, what a multitude of
               deductions it makes in a short time.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
               saw things in a new light; and for
               the first time in her life she reasoned for
               herself upon what she saw and felt. It
               is sometimes safer for young people to see,
               than to hear of certain characters. At
               a distance, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had appeared
               to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> the happiest person in
               the world; upon a nearer view, she discovered 
               that her ladyship was one of the 
               most miserable of human beings. To
               have married her niece to such a man as
               <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lord Delacour</persName>, <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> would have

               but it was now obvious to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
               that neither the title of viscountess, nor the

               ensure felicity. <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> confessed,
               that in the midest of the utmost luxury and

               could never be supplied by that public 
               admiration, of which she was so ambitious;
               and that the immoderate indulgence
               of her vanity had led her, by inevitable

            <p>It is singular that the very means, which

                history was a resolution to profit by her
                bad example; but this resolution it was
                more easy to form than to keep. Her
                ladyship, where she wished to please or
                to govern, had fascinating manners, and

                of wit, and the fond tone of persuasion,
                to accomplish her purposes. It was <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
                intention, in pursuance of her new
                plans of life, to spend, whilst she remained 
                in <placeName>London</placeName>, as little money as possible
                upon superfluities and dress. She had,
                at her own disposal, only <measure ana="#currency #commodity">100l.</measure> per annum,
                the interest of her fortune; but
                beside this, her aunt, who was desirous
                that she should go to court, and make
                a splendid figure there, had sent her a
                draught on her banker for <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred
                guineas</measure>. <quote>You will, I trust,</quote> said her

             to my curse—for he never sees my harp

          Delacour</persName>, opening the library door.—
          <said>Here she is–what doing I know not—
          studying <title ref="#hervey_tombs"><persName ref="#james_hervey_1714">Hervey's</persName> Meditations on the

          of hr looks—If you not be totally
          above all sublunary considerations, admire 
          my <ecda:flora>lilies of the valley</ecda:flora>—and let me
          give you a lecture, not upon heads—or
          upon hearts—but on what is of much 
          more consequence, upon hoops.–Every
          body wears hoops, but how few—'tis a
          melancholoy consideration—how very few
          can manage them!—There's my friend
          <persName ref="#lady_c_0001">lady C―</persName>; in an elegant undress she
          passes for very genteel, but put her into a
          hoop and she looks as pitiable a figure—
          as much a prisoner—and as little able to
          walk as a child in a go-cart.—She gets on,
          I grant you, and so does the poor child,
          but getting on you know is not walking.
          —O, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, I wish you had seen the
          two <rs ref="#lady_r_0001 #lady_r_0002" type="persGroup">lady R.'s</rs> sticking close to one another;
          their <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">father</ecda:anonPers> pushing them on together,
          like two decanters in a bottle-coaster
          –with such magnificent <ecda:commodity ana="#use">diamond</ecda:commodity> labels
          round their necks!</said>

          laughter, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> went on to mimic
          what she called the hoop awkwardness
          of all her acquaintance, and if these could
          have failed to divert <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, it was impossible
          for her to be serious, when she

          be full dressed in a quarter of an

          a good quarter of an hour; then the

          another quarter; and, at last, the dowager
          began to give an account of sundry
          wonderful cures that had been performed
          to her certain knowledge, by her favourite

          who really made his entrée with very composed

          his hoop with such skill and dexterity,
          that he well deserved the praise of being
          a universal genius. The <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>countess de Pomenars</persName></rs>
          spoke <name>French</name>, and broken <name>English</name>,
          incomparably well; and she made out that
          she was descended from the <name>Pomenars</name> of
           the time of <persName ref="#marie_de_rabutin_chantal_1626">madame de Sevigné</persName>: she said
           that she had in her possession several original

           a lock of <persName ref="#francoise_marguerite_de_sevigne_1646">madame de Grignan's</persName> fine hair.

       <p><said>I have sometimes fancied—but I believe

       <said>that this young lady,</said> turning to

       <p><rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>Madame de Pomenars</persName></rs> acknowledged

           <persName ref="#francoise_marguerite_de_sevigne_1646">madame de Grignan</persName> to say so.

     here, without flattery to the living, as you

     of which <persName ref="#marie_de_rabutin_chantal_1626">madame de Sevigné</persName> talked so
     much, was any thing to be compared to
     my <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>.</said>—As she spoke, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
     before <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was aware of her intentions,
     dextrously let down her beautiful
     tresses—and the <rs type="person" ref="#clarence_hervey_0001"><persName>countess de Pomenars</persName></rs>
     was so much struck at the sight, that she
     was incapable of paying the necessary

     </p>   
    <p>At this dangerous moment her ladyship
     artfully let drop the comb; <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
     suddenly stooped to pick it up, totally

     threw down the music stand with his

     and burst out a laughing.—<persName ref="#boucher_0001">Lady

   <p>Such was the modest, graceful dignity
   of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman's</persName> manners, that she

   —<said>Could I obtain a private audience

       <fw type="pageNum">148</fw>
   me, as I guess you have, by—my skill in

 </p>    
     
 <p>In the evening <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was
     in the music room a considerable time
     before <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> appeared; how patiently
     he waited is not known to any one
     but himself.—     
 </p>     
<p><said>Have I not given you time to compose
a charming speech,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
as she entered the room—<said>but make
it as short as you can, unless you wish that
<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> should hear it, for she will
be down stairs in three minutes.</said>
</p>
 <p><said>In one word then, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
 can you, and will you, make my
 peace with <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>—I am much
 concerned about that foolish razor-strop
 dialogue, which she overheard at <persName ref="#singleton_0001">lady

 </p>    
 <p><said>You are concerned that she overheard
 it—no doubt.</said></p>    
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">149</fw>
 <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, <said>I am
 rejoiced that she overheard it, since it has
 been the means of convincing me of my
  mistake; but I am concerned that I had 
 the presumption and injustice to judge of
 <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> so hastily.—I am convinced,
 that though she is a niece of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName>,
 she has dignity of mind, and simplicity 
 of character.—Will you, my dear
 <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, tell her so?</said>     
 </p>
 <p><said>Stay,</said> interrupted <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>;
 <said>let me get it by heart—I should have
 made a terrible bad messenger of the gods
 and goddesses, for I never in my life
 could, like <persName ref="#irish_0001">Iris</persName>, repeat a message in the
 same words in which it was delivered to
 me.—Let me see—<quote><said>Dignity of mind,

 May I not say at once <said>my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,

 </p>   
 <p><said>You make a most proper, but not
 sufficient emphatic difference between
 having, or suggesting such thoughts,</said>
 said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.—<said>A gentleman
 sometimes finds it for his interest, his

        <said>not a gentleman, may find it for
        his honour, or his interest, of his pleasure,
        to promise what he would not perform—
        but I am not a scoundrel—I never made
        any promise to man or woman, that I did
        not keep faithfully—I am not a swindler
        in love.</said> 
    </p>
    <p><said>And yet,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>you

        may go as far as that, may not I) of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
        Portman</persName> agree with your admiration of
        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>?</said>        
    </p>        
        <p><said>Perfectly well,</said> replied <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,
           <said>for all the world must be sensible, that
           <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> is a man of too much
           taste to compare a country novice in wit
           and accomplishments, to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.
           —He might, as men of genius sometimes 
           do, look forward to the idea of
           forming a country novice for a wife.—
           A man must marry some time or other—
           but my hour, thank Heaven, is not come
           yet.</said>            
        </p>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">153</fw>
      <p><said>Thank Heaven!</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, 
          <said>for you know, a married man is lost to
          the world of fashion and gallantry.</said>          
      </p>
       <p><said>No more so, I should hope, than
       a married woman,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>.
        —Here a loud knocking at the door announced
        the arrival of <ecda:persGroup>company</ecda:persGroup> to the 
        concert.—<said>You will make my peace, you 
        promise me, with <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,</said> cried
        <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, eagerly.           
       </p>
        <p><said>Yes, I will make your peace, and you
        shall see <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> smile upon you once
        more, upon condition,</said> continued <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
        Delacour</persName>, speaking very quickly, as if
        she was hurried by the sound of <ecda:persGroup>people</ecda:persGroup> 
         coming up stairs—<said>but we'll talk of that
         another time.</said>
      </p>
      <p><said>Nay, nay, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
         now, now,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, seizing her
          hand,—<said>Upon condition! upon what
          condition?</said>          
      </p>  
      <p><said>Upon condition that you do a little
          job for me—indeed for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—She is to
          go with me to the birthnight—and she
          has often hinted to me, that our <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> are
          shockingly shabby for people of our condition.
          —I know she wishes, that upon 
          such an occasion—her first appearance at
          court, you know—we shoud go in style.
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">154</fw>
          —Now my dear positive <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lord</rs> has <emph>said</emph>, he
          will not let us have a pair of the handsomest
          <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> I ever saw which are at <orgName>Tattersal's</orgName>,
          and on which <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, I know,
          has secretly set her heart, as I have openly
          in vain.</said>
      </p>
     <p><said>Your ladyship and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>
     cannot possibly set your hearts on any
     thing in vain—especially on any thing that 
     is in the power of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> to
     procure. Then,</said> added he gallantly, kissing
     her hand, <said>may I thus seal my treaty
     of peace?</said>         
     </p>
    <p><said>What audacity!—don't you see these
    <ecda:persGroup>people</ecda:persGroup> coming in?</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
      and she withdrew her hand, but with no
      great precipitation: she was evidently <quote rend="quotes">at
      this moment, as at all in the past</quote>, neither
      afraid nor ashamed, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey's</persName> devotions
      to her should be paid in public.
      With much address she had satisfied herself 
      as to his views, with respect to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
      She was convinced that he had no
      immediate thoughts of matrimony; but
      that if he were condemned to marry, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
      Portman</persName> would be his wife. As this did
        not interfere with her plans, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        was content.

      among the number of my public worshippers during my life—which
      you know cannot last long.—After I am 
      gone, my dear, he'll be all your own, and

      detestable.</said>          
      </p>          
    <p>There was one part of the conversation
        between <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> and her ladyship,
        which she, in her great discretion, did not
        immediately repeat to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>—that
        part which related to the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>.—In this
        transaction <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had no farther share,
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">156</fw>
        than having once, when her ladyship had
        the handsome <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> brought for her to
        look at, assented to the opinion, that they
        were the handsomest <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> she ever beheld.
        —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, however gallantly he
        replied to her ladyship, was secretly
        vexed to find that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had so little
        delicacy, as to permit her name to be employed
        in such a manner. He repented
        having used the improper expression of 
        <quote rend="italics">dignity of mind</quote>, and he relapsed into his
        former opinion of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> niece.
        —A <choice><sic>relape</sic><corr>relapse</corr></choice> is always more dangerous
        than the first disease.—He sent home the
        <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, the next day, and
        addressed <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, when he met her, with
        the air of a man of gallantry, who
        thought that his peace had been cheaply
        made.—But in proportion as his manners
        became more familiar, hers grew more
        reserved.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> rallied her upon
        <quote rend="italic">her prudery</quote>, but in vain.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
        seemed to think, that her ladyship had
        not fulfilled her part of the bargain.—<said>Is 
        not <distinct type="mentioned" rend="italic">smiling</distinct>,</said> said he, <said>the epithet always
        applied to peace—yet I have not been
        able to obtain one smile from <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
        since I have been promised peace.</said>

        <fw type="pageNum">157</fw>
        —Embarrassed by <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey's</persName> reproaches,
        and provoked to find <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
        was proof against all her raillery,
        <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> grew quite ill-humoured
        towards her. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, unconscious of having
        given any just cause of offence, was
        unmoved; and her lady's embarassment
        increased.—At last, resuming all her
        former appearance of friendship and confidence,
        she suddenly exclaimed, one night
        after she had flattered <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> into high
        spirits—
    </p>            
     <p><said>Do you know, my dear, that I have 
     been so ashamed of myself for this week
     past, that I hardly dared to look you
     in the face.—I am sensible I was downright 
     rude and cross to you one day—and
     ever since I have been penitent; and as
     all penitents are, very stupid and disagreeable,
     I am sure—but tell me you forgive
     my caprice, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> will be
     herself again.</said>         
     </p> 
     <p>It was not difficult to obtain <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> 
         forgiveness.         
     </p> 
     <p><said>Indeed,</said> continued <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
         <said>you are too good—but then, in my own
         justification I must say, that I have more
         things to make me ill-humoured than
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">158</fw>
         most people have.—Now, my dear, that
         most obstinate of human beings, <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>,
         has reduced me to the most terrible
         situation—I have made <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
         buy a pair of <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>, and I 
         cannot make my <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName> pay for
         them—but I forgot to tell you, that I took
         your name—not in vain indeed—in this
         business.—I told <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, that upon condition
         he would do this <emph>job</emph> for me, you
         would forgive him for all his sins, and
         nay, my dear, why do you look as if I had
         stabbed you to the heart—after all, I only 
         drew upon your pretty mought for a few
         smiles—Pray let me see whether it has actually
         forgotten <emph>how</emph> to smile.</said>    
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was too much vexed at this
         instant to understand raillery.—She was
         inspired by anger with unwonted courage,
         and losing all fear of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> wit,
         she very seriously expostulated with her

         without her consent or knowledge. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
         felt sure she was now in danger of being
         led into a situation, which might be fatal
         to her reputation and her happiness; and
         she was the more surprised at her ladyship,
         when she recollected the history she
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">159</fw>
         had so lately heard of <persName ref="#harriott_freke_0001">Harriot Freke</persName> and
         <persName ref="#lawless_0001">colonel Lawless</persName>. 
     </p>    
     <p><said>You cannot but be sensible, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
     said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>that after the contempt

     for match-making with <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female"><persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> 
     nieces</ecda:persGroup>, I should degrade myself by any
     attempts to attract his attention.—No wit,
     no eloquence, can change my opinion
     upon this subject—I cannot endure contempt.</said>         
     </p>
     <p><said>Very likely—no doubt</said>—interrupted
      <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but if you would only
      open your eyes, which heroines make it a
      principle never to do—or else there would 
      be an end of the novel—if you would only
      open your eyes, you would see that this
      man is in love with you; and whilst you
      are is afraid of his contempt, he is a hundred
      times more afraid of yours; and as long
      as you are each of you in such a fear of you
      know not what—you must excuse me if 
      I indulge myself in a little wholesome
      raillery.</said>—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> smiled—<said>There now,
      one such smile as that for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
      and I am out of debt and danger,</said>
      said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.         
     </p>
     <p><said>O, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, why, why will you
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">160</fw>
     try your power over me in this manner?</said>
     said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—<said>You know that I ought
     not to be persuaded to do what I am conscious
     is wrong.—But a few days ago you
     told me yourself, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> is—is
     not a marrying man; and a woman of 
     your penetration must see that—that he 
     only means to flirt with me.—I am not a
     match for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> in any respect.—
     He is a man of wit and gallantry—I am
     unpractised in the ways of the world.—I
     was not educated by my <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>—
     I have only been with her a few years—
     I wish I had never been with her in my

     </p>
    <p><said>I'll take care <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> shall know
    that,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but in the
    mean time, I do think any fair appraiser
    of delicate distresses would decide, that I
    am, all the circumstances considered, more
    to be pitied at this present moment than
    you are.—For the catastrophe of the business
    evidently is, that I must pay <measure  ana="#commodity #currency">two 
    hundred guineas</measure> for the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> some how
     or other.</said>
   <said>I can pay for them,</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
     <said>and will with the greatest pleasure.
     —I will not go to the birthnight—
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">161</fw>
     my dress is not bespoke.—Will <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred

    your <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt Stanhope</persName>, if you don't appear
    on the birthnight?—That cannot be, my

    send home your drawing-room dress today,
    and it would be so foolish to be presented

       <p><said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>I will not go

       nothing! Really I never saw any one so
       lavish of her money, and so economic of

       </p>   
       <p><said>Surely,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, <said>it is
        better for me to throw away <measure ana="#commodity #currency">fifty guineas</measure>,

       <distinct rend="italic" type="mentioned">b</distinct>.—No, no, my dear <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—here

       pay <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, for Heaven's sake, and

       But <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> the person you must

       he would see them and me and the whole
       human race expire, before he would change
       his silly mind.—Next month I shall have
       it in my power, my dear, to repay you,
       with a thousand thanks—and in a few 
       months more we shall have another birthday,
       and a new star shall appear in the
       firmament of fashion, and it shall be called
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—In the mean time, my dear
       upon second thoughts, perhaps we can get
       <persName ref="#franks_0001">Mrs. Franks</persName> to dispose of your drawing-

               <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, at your very extraordinary conduct,
               and more extraordinary letter.—
               What you can mean by principles and
               delicacy, I own I don't pretend to understand,
               when I see you not only forget the

               of the aunt, to whom you ow every
               thing; but you take upon yourself to
               laving her money, without common honesty.
               —I send you <measure ana="#commodity #currency">200 guineas</measure>, and
               desire you to go to court—you lend my

               me, that, as you think yourself bound in
               honour to her ladyship, you cannot explain 
               all the particulars to me, otherwise, 
               you are sure I should approve of the reasons
               which have influenced you.—Mightly
               satisfactory, truly!—And then to mend
               the matter, you tell me that you do not
               think, that in your situation in life it is necessary
               thaty ou should go to court.—Your 
               opinions and mine, you add, differ in many 
               points. Then I must say that you are
               as ungrateful, as you are presumptuous—
               for I am not such a novice in the affairs
               of this world, as to be ignorat that when
               a young lady professes to be of a different
               opinion from her friends, it is only a prelude
               to something worse. She begins by
               saying, that she is determined to think
               for herself; and she is determined to act
               for herself—and then it is all over with
               her—and all the money, &amp;c. that has

              the advice so artfully given to her in this

              find, that she had incurred the displeasure
              of an aunt to whom she thought herself
              under obligations. She resolved to lay by
              as much as she possibly could, from the
              interest of her fortune, and to repay the
              <measure ana="#commodity #currency">two hundred guineas</measure> to <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>:
              she was conscious that she had no right to
              lend this money to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, if her
              aunt had expressly desired that she should
              spend it only on her court dress; but this
              had not distinctly been expressed, when
              <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs. Stanhope</persName> had sent her niece the draughts.
              That lady was in the habit of speaking and
              writing ambiguously, so that even those 
              who knew her best, were frequently in
              doubut how to interpret her words. Yet
              she was extremely displeased when her
              hints, and her half-expressed wishes, were
              not understood.—Beside the concern she
              felt from the thoughts of having displeased
              her aunt, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was both vexed and
              mortified, to perceive that in <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

              not the change which she had expected

              spoke, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> attributed to her ladyship's
              desire that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> should not 
              know, that she had been obliged to borrow
              the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity> to pay him for the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #sale">horses</ecda:fauna>.
              <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> thought that this was a species
              of mean pride; but she made it a point
              to keep her ladyship's secret—she therefore
              slightly answered <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, <said direct="false">that
              she wondered that a man, who is so well

              be surprised at any instance of caprice
              from a woman.</said> The conversation then
              took another turn, and whilst they were
              talking of indifferent subjects, in came
              <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> man, <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, with

              was almost as great at this instant,
              as <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> confusion.

           upon carrying <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> away with them

         <p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> his way to <placeName>St. James's street</placeName>, where
          the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="wine_merchant"><ecda:food ana="#commodity">wine</ecda:food> merchant</ecda:anonPers> lived, <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip Baddely</persName>
          picked up several <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">young men</ecda:persGroup> of his
          acquaintance, who were all eager to witness
          a trial of <emph>taste</emph>, of epicurean taste—
          between the baronet and <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>.
          Among his other accomplishments
          our hero piqued himself upon the exquisite
          accuracy of his organs of taste. He 
          neither loved <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, nor was he fond of
          eating; but at fine dinners, with young 
          men who were real epicures, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>
          gave himself the airs of a connoisseur, and
          asserted superiority even in judging of
          <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>sauces</ecda:food>. Having gained immortal
          honour at an entertainment, by gravely
          protesting that some <ecda:food ana="#fauna">turtle</ecda:food> would have
          been excellent if it had not been done <quote rend="italic">a
          bubble too much</quote>, he presumed, elate as 
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">173</fw>   
         he was with the applauses of the <ecda:persGroup>company</ecda:persGroup>,
         to assert, that no man in <placeName>England</placeName>
         had a more correct taste than himself.—
         <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip Baddely</persName> could not passively submit
          to this arrogance; he loudly proclaimed,
          that though he would not dispute <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr.
          Hervey's</persName> judgment as far as eating was concerned,
         yet he would defy him as a connoisseur 
         in <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food>, and he offered to submit the
         competition to any eminent wine-merchant
         in <placeName>London</placeName>, and to some common friend
         of acknowledged taste and experience.—
         <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName> was chosen as the common
         friend of acknolwedged taste and experience;
         and a fashionable <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="wine_merchant" a-gender="male">wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>
         was pitched upon, to decide with him the
         merits of these candidates for bacchanalian
         fame. <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip</persName>, who was just going to
         furnish his cellars, was a person of importance
         to the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="wine_merchant">wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>, who produced
          accordingly his choicest treasures. <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir
          Philip</persName> and <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> 
          with affected gravity; and they delivered
          their opinions of the positive and comparative 
          merits of each. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="wine_merchant" a-gender="male">wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>
          evidently, as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> thought,
          leaned towards <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName>. <said>Upon my

              <fw type="pageNum">174</fw>
          word, <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName>, you are right—that
          <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food> is the best I have—you certainly
          have a most discriminating taste,</said> said the
          complaisant <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="wine_merchant">wine-merchant</ecda:anonPers>. <said>I'll tell
          you what,</said> cried <persName ref="#ph">sir Philip</persName>, <said>the thing
          is this—by G― now there's no possibility
          now—no possibility now by G― of
          imposing upon me.</said>—<said>Then,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
          Hervey</persName>, <said>would you engage to tell
          the difference between these two <ecda:food>wines</ecda:food>
          ten times running, blindfold?</said>—<said>Ten 
          times, that's nothing,</said> replied <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Philip</persName>;
          <said>yes, fifty times, I would, by G―.</said>
         </p>       
         <p>But when it came to the trial, <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName>
          had nothing left but oaths in his own 
          favour. <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was victorious, 
          and his sense of the importance of this
          victory was much increased by the fumes
          of the <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, which began to operate upon
          his brain. His triumph was, as he said 
          it ought to be, bacchanalian—he laughed
          and sang with <rs type="properAdjective">Anacreontic</rs> spirit, and
          finished by declaring, that he deserved
          to be crowned with <ecda:flora>vine-leaves</ecda:flora>. <said>Dine
          with me, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>,</said> said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, <said>and
          we'll crown you three times three—
          and,</said> whispered he to <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName>—<said>we'll
          have another trial after dinner.</said>

            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">175</fw>

          <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName>, yawning pathetically.

            was much affected by the <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, and <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>
            proposed that they should take a turn
            in the park to cool <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey's</persName> head. To
            <placeName>Hyde-park</placeName> they repaired; <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> boasting
             all the way they walked, of the superior

          </p>      
          <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> protested that his own was

              observed, that at this instant he walked
              better than any person in company, <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir

           <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, who had very quick 
             feelings, was extremely hurt by the indifference
             which his dear friends had
             shown, when his life was in danger; he
             was apt to believe that he really was an
             object of affection and admiration amongst
             his companions; and that though they
             were neither very wise, nor very witty,
             they were certainly very good natured.
             When they had forfeited by their late
             conduct these claims to his regard, his
             partiality for them was changed into contempt.

                  in her favour. The effect of her

                  wit and gayety there was an appearance

                   all probability be soon established as true
                   history.—The <ecda:food>desert</ecda:food> was on the table
                   before <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> had done with the <ecda:fauna>mammoth</ecda:fauna>

               placed before the <rs ref="#helena_delacour_0001">young lady</rs> he had before

             the <rs ref="#margaret_delacour" type="person">severe old lady</rs>, in a voice more terrific

                 but her voice faltered so much, that she

             </p>  
             <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> perceived that he had been
                 the cause of her agitation, though he
                 knew not precisely by what means, and he
                 now applied himself in silence to the

                 surprised by this sudden discovery.—
                 When he went into the drawing-room to
                 <ecda:food>tea</ecda:food>, he found his friend, the stern <rs type="person" ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">old

                 —The words which he heard as he came

              <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> bowed, as if he had received a

               how does she show her sensibility?—Has

           with as much respect, as she has met with
           admiration and gallantry in her youth.—
           Poor woman, her head has absolutely
           been turned with admiration—and if fame
           say true, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> has had his share
           in turning that head by his flattery.</said>               
           </p>    
           <p><said>I am sure her ladyship has turned
           mine by her charms,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, <said>and
           I certainly am not to be blamed for admiring
           what all the world admires.</said>               
           </p>    
           <p><said>I wish,</said> said the <rs type="person" ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">old lady</rs>, <said>for her
           own sake, for the sake of her family, and 
           for the sake of her reputation, that my
           <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had fewer admirers, and
           more friends.</said>               
           </p>    
           <p><said>Women, who have met with so many

           <p><said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>, <said>for they

           </p>    
            <p><said>We learn the value of all things, but
            especially of friends, by experience,</said> said
            <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>; <said>and it is no wonder, therefore,
            that those who have little experience

            </p>   
            <p><said>This is very good natured sophistry—
            but <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> is too vain ever to have

            </p>   
            <p><said>That is certainly a great deal,</said>
             said <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>, <said>but then we must consider,
             that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, as an heiress, a
             beauty, and a wit, has a right to a triple
             share of vanity ast least.</said>
            </p>   
             <p><said>Both her fortune and her beauty are 
             gone; and if she had any wit left, it is
             time it should teach her how to conduct
             herself, I think,</said> said <persName ref="#margaret_delacour_0001">Mrs. Delacour</persName>,
             <said>but I give her up—I give her up.</said>                 
             </p>
             <p><said>O, no,</said> said <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>, <said>you must
             not give her up yet.—I have been informed,
             and upon <emph>the best authority</emph>, that
             <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was not always the unfeeling

          probably should never have been acquainted

          my little <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>—About the time that
          the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old gardener</ecda:anonPers> was left a begger, as I
          happened to be walking out one fine evening
          in <placeName>Sloane-street</placeName>, I met a procession of
          <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" a-occupation="student">school girls</ecda:persGroup>—an <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> begged from 
          them in a most moving voice; and as they
          passed, several of the <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="student" a-gender="female">young ladies</ecda:persGroup> threw
          <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">halfpence</ecda:commodity> to him.—One little girl, who
          observed that the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers> could not stoop
          without great difficulty, staid behind the

          <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="gardener" a-gender="male">old man</ecda:anonPers>, and put them into his had.—He
          began to tell his story over again to her,
          and she stayed so long listening to it, that
          her <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female" a-occupation="student">companions</ecda:persGroup> had turned the corner of
          the street, and were out of sight.—She
          looked about in great distress; and I never
          shall forget the pathetic voice with which
          she said, <said>O what will become of me?
           every body will be angry with me?</said>—I

              <fw type="pageNum">210</fw>
          with her, and she gave me her little hand

          took her home to her <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="schoolmistress">schoolmistress</ecda:anonPers>, and
          I was so pleased with the beginning of

          have heard always leads to another.—<persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>

          has the goodness to let her little

          <said>her spirits were quite broken by her <rs ref="#delacour_0001" type="person">mother's</rs>

         with whom she had long desired to converse.
         <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> had a great literary

         ration. She perceived also that he had
         considerable influence with <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,

         make her wish for his good opinion. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>

         manners and conversation; she saw that
         he paid her much attention, and she was

         of her; but she had the good sense and
         good taste to avoid a display of her abilities

         who has any knowledge of the world and

            <fw type="pageNum">220</fw>

        has honoured me with her commands
        to go to her as often as possible.
        For your sake, my dear <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>, I shall
        obey her ladyship most punctually, that I

        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> expressed his gratitude with
         much energy, for this instance of the

         been entertained by <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―'s</persName> conversation
         during this first visit, was more
         and more delighted with his understanding
         and character. She felt that
         he unfolded her powers, and that with the
         greatest politeness and address he raised
         her confidence in herself, without ever
         descending to flattery. By degrees <supplied reason="flawedReproduction">s</supplied>he
         learned to look upon him as a friend;
         she imparted to him with great ingenuousness
         her opinions on various subjects
         and she was both amused and instructed
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">221</fw>
         by his observations on the characters and
         manners of the company who frequented
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> assemblies. She did not
         judge of the doctor's sincerity merely by
         the kindness he showed her, but by his 
         conduct towards others.

        <p>One night, at a select party at <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>

           prove the extraordinary passions which
           some of his countrymen formerly showed
           for the game of chess. He mentioned families,
           in which unfinished games, bequeathed
           by will, had descended from father
           to son, and where victory was doubtful 
           for upwards of a century.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> observed, that gaining a

            seemed to confer more eclat; for that an
            <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="abbe" a-religion="catholic">abbé</ecda:anonPers>, by losing adroitly a game at chess
            to the <ecda:anonPers a-aig="spanish" a-occupation="minister"><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> minister</ecda:anonPers>, obtained a cardinal's

        <p>The <ecda:anonPers a-aig="spanish" a-gender="male">foreigner</ecda:anonPers> was flattered by the manner
            in which <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName> introduced this slight
            circumstance, and he directed to him his
            conversation, speaking in <name>French</name> and

            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">222</fw>
            skilled in both languages, but <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> 
            spoke them better. Till he appeared,
            the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-aig="spanish">foreigner</ecda:anonPers> was the principal object of 
            attention, but he was soon eclipsed by
            <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Nothing amusing or instructive
            that could be said upon the game 
            of chess escaped him, and the literary
            ground, which the slow don would have
            taken some hours to go regularly over,
            our hero traversed in a few minutes.—
            From <persName ref="#richard_twiss_1747">Twiss</persName> to <persName ref="#marco_vida_1485">Vida</persName>, from <persName>Irwin</persName> to <persName ref="#william_jones_1747">sir
            William Jones</persName>, from <placeName>Spain</placeName> to <placeName>India</placeName>, he
            passed with admirable celerity, and seized

        <p>By this display of knowledge he surprised
            even his friend <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>. The

            in the practice as in the theory of the game

        </p>
        <p>The combat now began—the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed">spectators</ecda:persGroup> 
         were silent.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> made an error in
         his first move, for his attention was distracted
         by seeing <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> behind his adversary's
         chair. The <name>Spaniard</name> was deceived
         by this mistake into a contemptuous
         opinion of his opponent—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> 
         changed her place—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> recovered
         his presence of mind, and convinced him
         that he was not a man to be despised.
         The combat was long doubtful, but at
         length, to the surprise of all present, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

        <p>Exulting in his success he looked round

            the honours of his triumph.—She
            had left the room, but soon she returned,
            dressed in the character of <persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">Queen Elizabeth</persName>,
            in which she had once appeared at
            a masquerade, with a large ruff, and all
            the costume of the times.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, throwing himself at
            her feet, addressed her in that high flown
            style, whic her <rs type="person">majesty</rs> was <sic>want</sic> to hear
            from the gallant <persName ref="#walter_raleigh_1554">Raleigh</persName>, or the accomplished

        </p>
        <p>Soon the coquetry of the queen entirely
            conquered her prudery; and the favoured
            courtier, evidently elated by his situation,
            was as enthusiastic as her majesty's most
            insatiable vanity could desire. The characters
            were well supported; both the 
            actor and actress were highly animated,
            and seemed so fully possessed by their 
            parts, as to be insensible to the comments
            that were made on the scene. <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
            hervey</persName> was first recalled to himself by
            the deep blush which he saw on <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName>
            cheek, when <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0001"><persName ref="#elizabeth_i_england_1533">queen Elizabeth</persName></rs> addressed
            her as one of her maids of honour, of

            conscious that he had been hurried by the
            enthusiasm of the moment farther than he
            either wished or intended. It was difficult
            to recede, when her majesty seemed
            disposed to advance; but <rs ref="#clarence_hervey_0001" type="person"><persName ref="#walter_raleigh_1554">sir Walter

            turned to the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-aig="spanish">foreigner</ecda:anonPers>, whom he accosted
            as the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> ambassador.

        <p><said>Your excellency sees,</said> said he, <said>how
        this great queen turns the head of her

        —Has the new world afforded you any

        <p>The <ecda:anonPers a-aig="spanish" a-gender="male"><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> ambassador's</ecda:anonPers> grave replies
            to this playful question gave a new turn
            to the conversation, and relieved <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence

            Delacour</persName>, though still in high spirits, was
            easily diverted to other objects. She took
            the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-aig="spanish">ambassador</ecda:anonPers> with her to the next room,
            to show him a picture of <persName ref="#mary_stuart_1542">Mary, queen

           If I could feel her pulse, I could

        and obey. Now, you understand,
        I am not in the least obliged to <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>
        for her kindness to <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>; because it all
        goes under the head of obedience, in my
        imagination—and her ladyship is paid for it
        by an accession of character—she has the
        reward of having it said—<said>O, <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne
        Percival</persName> is the best wife in the world</said>—
        <said>O, <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival</persName> is quite a pattern
        woman!</said>—I hate pattern women,—I hope
        I may never see <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>, for I'm sure
        I should detest her beyond all things living
        —<persName ref="#luttridge_0001">Mrs. Luttridge</persName> not excepted.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was surprised and shocked at
         the malignant vehemence with which her
         ladyship uttered these words; it was in 
         vain, however, that she remonstrated on
         the injustice of predetermining to detest
         <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>; merely because she had shown
         kindness to <persName ref="#helena_delacour_0001">Helena</persName>, and because she bore
         a high character.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> was a 
         woman who never listened to reason; or
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">241</fw>
         who listened to it only that she might
         parry it by wit. Upon this occasion, her
         wit had not it's usual effect upon <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
         Portman</persName>; instead of entertaining, it disgusted
         her.

        <p><said>But I have not the courage to hear

        her ears.—<said>So your conscience may
        be at ease; you may suppose that you
        have said every thing that is wise, and
        good, and proper, and sublime, and that

        —you shall enjoy the office of censor to

           her countenance as she spoke.—She turned

            <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was sinking into the grave,
            had formed a design worthy of his ardent
            and benevolent character.—The manner
            in which her ladysip had spoken of his

            impression upon <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>. Till then,
            he had merely considered her ladyship as
            an object of amusement, and introduction
            to high life; but he now felt so much
            interested for her, that he determined to
            exert all his influence to promote her happiness.
            —He knew <emph>that</emph> influence to be
            considerable—not that he was either coxcomb,
            or dupe enough, to imagine that
            <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was in love with him: he

            <fw type="pageNum">245</fw>
            solved to show her, that it could no longer
            be secured without deserving his esteem.
            —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> was a thoroughly generous
            young man: capable of making
            the greatest sacrifices, when encouraged

            to postpone the declration of his attachment
            to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, that he might devote
            himself entirely to his new project. His
            plan was to wean <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, by degrees,
            from dissipation, by attaching her
            to her daughter, and to <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival</persName>.
            He was sanguine in all his hopes,
            and rapid, but not unthinking, in all his
            decisions.—From <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> he went
            immediately to <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, to whom he
            communicated his designs.
        </p>
        <p><said>I applaud your benevolent intentions,</said>
           said the <rs type="person" ref="rx">doctor</rs>, <said>but have you really the
           presumption to hope, that an ingenuous
           young man of five and twenty can reform

            the chance of her giving up a losing game.
            —She has an admirable understanding,
            and she will soon—I mean as soon as she

            trust to you.—Do you prepare <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne</persName>
            to tolerate <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> faults, and I

        I wish my lady had never seen them.—O
        my lady, my poor lady, what will become
        of her?</said>            
        </p>
        <p>It was some minutes before <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
          could obtain from <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> any intelligible
          account of what had happened.
        </p>
        <p><said>All I know, ma'am, is what <persName ref="#james_0001">James</persName>
        has just told me,</said> said <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>.—<said>My
        lady gave the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="coachman">coachman</ecda:anonPers> orders upon no

        would not give up the point either.—
        My lady's <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> were young and ill broke,
        they tell me, and there was no managing
        of them no ways.—The carriages got some
        how across one another, and my lady was
        overturned, and all smashed to atoms.—
        O ma'am!</said> continued <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, <said>if it had 
        not been for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>, they say, my
        lady would never have been got out of the
        crowd alive.—He's bringing her home in
        his own carriage—God bless him!</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>But is <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> hurt?</said> cried
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.            
        </p>
        <p><said>She <emph>must</emph>—to be sure she must,
        ma'am,</said> cried <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, putting her hand
        upon her bosom.—<said>But let her be ever so
        much hurt, my lady will keep it to herself
        —<ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="footman">footmen</ecda:persGroup> swear she did not give
        a scream, not a single scream; so it's their
        opinion she was no ways hurt—But that I 
        know can't be—And indeed, they are
        thinking so much about the carriage, that
        they can't give any one rational <choice><sic>accout</sic><corr>account</corr></choice> of
        any thing—and as for myself, I'm sure I'm
        in such a flutter.—Lord knows, I advised 
        my lady not to go with the young <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>,
        no later than—</said>            
        </p>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">252</fw>
        <p><said>Hark!</said> cried <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>here they
        are.</said> She ran down stairs instantly. The
        first object that she saw was <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        in convlusions—the street-door was
        open—the hall was crowded with <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servants">servants</ecda:persGroup>.
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> made her way through them, and,
        in a calm voice, requested that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        might immediately be brought to her
        own dressing-room, and that she should
        there be left to <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott's</persName> care and hers.
        <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> assisted in carrying <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        —she came to her senses as they were
        taking her up stairs. <said>Set me down—
        set me down,</said> she exclaimed. <said>I am
        not hurt—I am quite well—Where's <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>?
        Where's <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>?</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>Here we are—you shall be carried
        quite safely—trust to me,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
        in a firm tone, <said>and do not struggle.</said>
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> submitted—she was in
         agonizing pain; but her fortitude was so
         great that she never uttered a groan. It
         was the constraint which she had put upon
         herself, by endeavouring not to scream,
         which threw her into convulsions. <said>She
         is hurt, I am sure she is hurt, though she
         will not acknowledge it,</said> cried <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
         Hervey</persName>. <said>My ankle is sprained, that's

         all,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—<said>lay me on this 
         sofa, and leave me to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName></said>.            
        </p>
        <p><said>What's all this?</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>,
         staggering into the room: he was much intoxicated,
         and in this condition had just 
         come home, as they were carrying <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
         Delacour</persName> up stairs: he could not be made
         to understand the truth, but as soon as he
         heard <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> voice, he insisted
         upon going up to <emph>his wife's</emph> dressing room.
         It was a very unusual thing, but neither
         <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> nor any one else could restrain
         him, the moment he had formed this
         idea; he forced his way into the room.            
        </p>
        <p><said>What's all this?—<persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel Lawless</persName>!</said>
         said he addressing himself to <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>,
         whom, in the confusion of his mind,
         he mistook for the colonel, the first object 
         of his jealousy. <said><persName ref="#lawless_0001">Colonel Lawless</persName>,</said> cried
         his <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs>, <said>you are a villain.—I always
         knew it.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>Softly!—she's in great pain, my lord,</said>
         said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, catching <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> arm,
         just as he was going to strike <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence 
         Hervey</persName>. She led him to the sofa where
         <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> lay, and uncovering her
         ancle, which was much swelled, showed 
         it to him. His lordship, who was a
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">254</fw>
         humane man, was somewhat moved by this
         appeal to his remaining senses, and he began
         roaring as loud as he possibly could
         for <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">arquebusade</ecda:commodity>.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> rested her head upon
         the back of the sofa, her hands moved
         with convulsive twitches—she was perfectly
         silent. <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was in a great bustle,
         running backwards and forwards for she
         knew not what, and continually repeating,
         <said>I wish nobody would come in here but
         <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> and me.—My lady says nobody
         must come in.—Lord bless me!—
         my lord here too!</said>         
        </p>
        <p><said>Have you any <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">arquebusade</ecda:commodity>, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>?
        <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">Arquebusade</ecda:commodity>, for your lady directly!</said>
        cried his <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs>, following her to the
        door of the boudoir, where she was going
        for some drops.
        </p>
        <p><said>O my lord, you can't come in, I assure 
        you, my lord, there's nothing here, my
        lord, nothing of the sort,</said> said <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,
        setting her back against the door.—Her terrour
        and embarrassment instantly recalled
        all the jealous suspicions of <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>.
        <said>Woman!</said> cried he, <said>I <emph>will</emph> see whom
        you have in this room!—You have some
        one concealed there, and I <emph>will</emph> go in.</said>—   
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">255</fw>
        Then with brutal oaths he dragged <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
        from the door, and snatched the key
        from her struggling hand.
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady <sic>Dalacour</sic></persName> started up, and gave a
         scream of agony. <said>My lord!—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lord Delacour</persName>,</said>
         cried <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, springing forward,
         <said>hear me.</said>
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName> stopped short.—<said>Tell 
        me then,</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>, <said>is not a
        lover of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> concealed there?</said>
        <said>No!—No!—No!</said> answered <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
        <said>THen a lover of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman's</persName></said> said
        <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>—<said>Gad! we have hit it now,
        I believe.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Believe whatever you please, my
        lord,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> hastily—<said>but give me
        the key.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> drew the key from
        <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour's</persName> hand, gave it to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
        Portman</persName> without looking at her, and immediately
        withdrew.—<persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName> followed
        him with a sort of drunken laugh;
        and no one remained in the room but
        <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, and <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.—
        <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> was so much <emph>fluttered</emph>, as she said,
        that she could do nothing.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> 
        locked the room door, and began to un-
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">256</fw>
        dress <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, who lay motionless.
        <said>Are we by ourselves,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
        opening her eyes.            
        </p>
        <p><said>Yes—are you much hurt?</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
        <said>O, you are a charming girl!</said>
         said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.—<said>Who would have
         thought you had so much presence of
         mind and courage—have you the key
         safe?</said> <said>Here it is,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, producing
         it; and she repeated her question
         —<said>are you much hurt?</said> <said>I am not in
         pain now,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>but I
         <emph>have</emph> suffered terribly.—If I could get rid
         of all this finery—if you could put me to
         bed I could sleep perhaps.</said>
        </p>
        <p>Whilst <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was undressing <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
        Delacour</persName>, she shrieked several times; but
        between every interval of pain she repeated,
        <said>I shall be better to-morrow.</said> As
        soon as she was in bed, she desired <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
        to give her double her usual quantity
        of <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity>; for that all the inclination
        which she had felt to sleep was gone, and
        that she could not endure the shooting
        pains that she felt in her breast.            
        </p>
        <p><said>Leave me alone with your lady, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,</said>
         said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName>, taking the bot-

            <fw type="pageNum">257</fw>
        tle of <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity> from her trembling hand,

        able to sit up any longer.</said>
        </p>
        <p>As she spoke, she took <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> into
        the adjoinding dressing-room.—<said>O dear

        sincerely attached to her lady, and who at

        her love of power—<said>I'll do any thing you
        ask me—but pray let me stay in the room,
        though I know I'm quite helpless.—It will
        be too much for you to be here all night
        by yourself.—The convulsions may take
        my lad.—What shrieks she gives every
        now and then!—and nobody knows what's
        the matter but ourselves; and every body
        in the house is asking me why a surgeon
        is not sent for, if my lady is so much hurt.
        O, I can't answer for it to my conscience,
        to have kept the matter secret so long; for
        to be sure a physician, if had in time,
        might have saved my lady—but now nothing
        can save her!</said>—And here <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>
        burst into tears.
        </p>
        <p><said>Why don't you give me the <ecda:commodity ana="#medical">laudanum</ecda:commodity>?</said>
        cried <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, in a loud peremptory
        voice—<said>Give it to me instantly.</said>
        —<said>No,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> firmly.—

            <fw type="pageNum">258</fw>   
        <said>Hear me, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—you must allow

        —or rather you must allow me to send
        for a physician, who may judge for us
        both.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>A physician!</said> cried <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
         —<said>Never—never.—I charge you let no

       yourself—it is already known by your

       overturn of your carriage—if you do not
       let either a surgeon or physician see you,
       it will excited surprise and suspician.—It
       is not in your power when violent pain
       seizes you to refrain from</said>—<said>It is,</said> interrupted
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, <said>not another
       scream shall you hear—only do not, do not,

       you see, has lost all command of herself—

           <fw type="pageNum">259</fw>

       </p>
      <p><said>No danger of that,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,
       <said>tell him my ancle is sprained—
       tell him I am bruised all over—tell him
       any thing you will—he will not trouble

      <p>It was in vain to reason with <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.
        <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> attempted to persuade

     <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> hesitated. <said>You see,</said>
      continued <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>that I am in earnest,
      when I am gone you will have no friend
      left—when I am gone your secret will
      inevitably be discovered, for without me
      <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> will not have sufficient strength
      of mind to keep it.</said>
     </p>
     <p><said>Do you think we might trust <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.

     <p><said>I am sure you may trust him,</said> said
      <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> with energy: <said>I will pledge my

     </p>
     <p><said>Then send for him, since it must be
     so,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>.

     <p>No sooner had the words passed <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
     Delacour's</persName> lips, than <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> flew to execute
     her orders.—<persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> recovered her
     senses, when she heard that her ladyship
     had consented to send for a physician, but
     she declared, that she could not conceive
     how any thing less than the power of
     magic could have brought her lady to such
     a determination.
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> had scarcely dispatched a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant">servant</ecda:anonPers>
     for <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, when <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">261</fw>
    repented of the permission she had given,
    and all that could be said to pacify, only
    irritated her temper.—She became delirous;
    <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> presence of mind never
    forsook her, she remained quietly beside
    the bed waiting for the arrival of <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.
    X―</persName>, and she absolutely refused admittance
    to the <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servant">servants</ecda:persGroup>, who, drawn by their
    lady's outrageous cries, continually came
    to her door with offers of assistance.
     </p>
     <p>About four o'clock the doctor arrived,
     and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> was relieved from some
     of her anxiety. He assured her taht there
     was no immediate danger, and he promised
     that the secret which she had entrusted
     to him should be faithfully kept.—
     He remained with her some hours, till
     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> became more quiet and
     fell asleep, exhausted with delirious exertions.
     —.<said>I think I may now leave you,</said>
     said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, but as he was going
     through the dressing-room. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> stopped
     him.—<said>Now that I have time to
     think of myself,</said> said she—<said>let me consult
     you as my friend—I am not used to
     act entirely for myself, and I shall be most
     grateful if you will assist me with your
     advice.—I hate all mysteries, but I feel
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">262</fw>
     myself bound in honour to keep the secret,
     with which <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> has entrusted
     me.—Last night I was so circumstanced,
     that I could not extricate her ladyship
     without exposing myself to—to suspicion.</said>
     </p>
     <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> then related all taht
     had passed about the mysterious door,
     which <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>, in his fit of drunken
     jealousy, had insisted upon breaking open.
     </p>
     <p><said><persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>,</said> continued <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>

     he seemed much surprised—I should be
     sorry that—he should remain in an errour
     which might be fatal to my reputation—
     you know a woman ought not even to be
     suspected—yet how to remove this suspicion
     I know not, because I cannot enter
     into any explanation without betraying
     <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>—she has, I know, a peculiar
     dread of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey's</persName> discovering the
     truth.</said>
     </p>
    <p><said>And is it possible,</said> cried <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>,
    <said>that any woman should be so meanly
    selfish, as thus to expose the reputation of
    her friend merely to preserve her own 
    vanity from mortification.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>Hush—don't speak so loud,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
     <said>you will awaken her—and at pre-

         <fw type="pageNum">263</fw>
     sent she is certainly more an object of pity
     than of indignation.—If you will have the
     goodness to come with me, I will take
     you by a back staircase up to the <emph>mysterious
     boudoir</emph>.—I am not too proud to
     give positive proofs of my speaking truth;
     the key of that room now lies on <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
     Delacour's</persName> bed—it was that which she
     grasped in her hand during her delirioum—
     she has now let it fall—It opens both the 
     doors of the boudoir—you shall see,</said>
     added <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> witha a smile, <said>that
     I am not afraid to let you unlock either of
     them.</said>
    </p>
    <p><said>As a polite man,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>,
     <said>I believe that I should absolutely refuse 
     to take any external evidence of a lady's 
     truth! but demonstration is unanswerable
     even by enemies, and I will not sacrifice your interests to the foppery of my
     politeness—so I am ready to follow you.
     The curiosity of the <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="servant">servants</ecda:persGroup> may have
     been excited by last night's disturbance,
     and I see no method so certain as that 
     which you propose of preventing busy 
     <persName ref="#rumour_0001">Rumour</persName>. That goddess (let <persName ref="#ovid_0043">Ovid</persName> say
     what he pleases) was born and bred in a

     nued <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, <said>my dear <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
     you will put a stop to a number of 
     charming stories by this prudence of yours
     —a romance called the <title>Mysterious Boudoir</title>,
     of nine volumes at least, might be
     written on this subject, if you would only 
     condescend to act like almost all other
     heroines, that is to say, without common
     sense.</said>
    </p> 
    <p>The <rs ref="#dr_x_0001" type="person">doctor</rs> now followed <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, and
      satisfied himself by ocular demonstration,
      that this cabinet was the retirement of
      disease, and not of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>It was about eight o'clock in the morning
      when <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> got home; he found
      <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> waiting for him. <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Clarence</persName>
      seemed to be in great agitation,
      though he endeavoured, with all the
      power which he possessed over himself,
      to suppress his emotion.
    </p>
    <p><said>You have been to see <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>,</said>
      said he, calmly—<said>Is she much hurt?
      It was a terrible accident.</said>  
    </p>
    <p><said>She has been much hurt,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr.

    hours delirious—but ask me no more
    questions now, for I am asleep and must
    go to bed—but ask me no more
    questions now, for I am asleep and must
    go to bed—unless you have any thing to

        <fw type="pageNum">265</fw>
    say that can waken me—you look as if
    some great misfortune has befallen you,
    what is the matter?</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>O, my dear friend,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>,
     taking his hand—<said>do not jest with me, I
     am not able to bear your raillery in my
     present temper—in one word, I fear that
     <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> is unworthy of my esteem—I can
     tell you no more—except that I am more
     miserable than I thought any woman
     could make me.</said>           
    </p>
    <p><said>You are in a prodigious hurry to be
    miserable,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>; <said>upon my
    word, I think you would mae a mighty 
    pretty hero in a novel; you take things
    very properly for granted, and stretched
    out upon that sofa, you act the distracted
    lover vastly well—and to complete the
    matter, you cannot tell me why you are
    more miserable than ever man or hero
    was before.—I must tell you then, that
    you have still more cause for jealousy than
    you suspect.—Ay, start—every jealous
    man starts at the sound of the word jealousy
    —a certain symptom <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">this</unclear> of the
    disease.</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>You mistake me,</said> cried <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">266</fw>
    Hervey</persName>, <said>no man is less disposed to jealousy
    than I am—but—</said>        
    </p>
    <p><said>But your mistress—no, not your 
    mistress, for you have never yet declared
    to her your attachment—but the lady
    you admire, will not let a drunken man
    unlock a door, and you immediately suppose</said>—        
    </p>
   <p><said>She has mentioned the circumstance
   to you!</said> exclaimed <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>, in a joyful
   tone—<said>then she <emph>must</emph> be innocent.</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>Admirable reasoning!—I was going
   to have told you just now, if you would
   have suffered me to speak connectedly,
   that you have more reason for jealousy
   than you suspect, for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> has
   actually unlocked for me—for me! look 
   at me—the door, the mysterious door—
   and whilst I live, and whilst she lives, we
   can neither of us ever tell you the cause of
   the mystery.—All I can tell you is, that
   no lover is in the case, upon my honour
   —and now, if you should ever mistake
   curiosity in your own mind for jealousy,
   expect no pity from me.</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>I should deserve none,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
   Hervey</persName>, <said>you have made me the happiest
   of men.</said>      
   </p>
        <pb/>
        <fw type="pageNum">267</fw>
   <p><said>The happiest of men!—No, no; keep
   that superlative exclamation for a future
   occasion.—But now you behave like a
   reasonable creature, you deserve to hear
   the praises of your <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>—I am so much
   charmed with her, that I wish—</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>When can I see her,</said> interrupted
     <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Hervey</persName>, <said>I'll go to her this instant.</said>       
   </p>
   <p><said>Gently,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, <said>you forget
   what time of the day it is—you forget
   that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> has been up all
   night—that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> is extremely ill
   —and that this would be the most unseasonable opportunity you could <choice><sic>possible</sic><corr>possibly</corr></choice>
   choose for your visit.</said>       
   </p>
  <p>To this observation <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
    assented; but he immediately seized a pen
    from the <rs ref="#dr_x_0001" type="person">doctor's</rs> writing-table, and began
    a letter to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.—The doctor threw
    himself upon his sofa, saying—<said>Waken
    me when you want me</said>—and in a few
    minutes he was fast asleep.
  </p> 
  <p><said>Doctor, upon second thoughts,</said> said
   <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, rising suddenly, and tearing his
   letter down the middle, <said>I cannot write
   to her yet—I forgot the reformation of
   <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>—how soon do you think
       <pb/>
       <fw type="pageNum">268</fw>
   she will be well?—Besides, I have another
   reason for not writing to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> at
   present—you must know, my dear doctor,
   that I have, or had, another mistress.</said>      
  </p>
  <p><said>Another mistress indeed!</said> cried <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr
  X―</persName>, trying to waken himself.      
  </p>
  <p><said>Good God! I do believe you've been
  asleep.</said>
  </p>
  <p><said>I do believe I have.</said>      
  </p>
  <p><said>But is it possible that you could fall
  sound asleep in that time?</said>      
  </p>
  <p><said>Very possible,</said> said the doctor,
  <said>what is there so extraordinary in a man's
  falling asleep!—men are apt to sleep some
  time within the four and twenty hours—
  unless they have half a dozen mistresses to
  keep them awak, as you seem to have,
  my good friend.</said>      
  </p>
  <p>A servant now came into the room with
    a letter, that had just arrived express from
    the country for <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice>      
  </p>
  <p><said>This is another affair,</said> cried he, rousing
      hisemf.      
  </p>
  <p>The letter required the doctor's immediate
    attendance. He shook hands with
    <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>—      
  </p>
 <p><said>My dear friend, I am really concerned
     <pb/>
     <fw type="pageNum">269</fw>
 that I cannot stay to hear the history of
 your six mistresses; but you see that this
 is an affair of life and death.</said>     
 </p>
 <p><said>Farewell,</said> said <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, <said>I have
 not six, I have only three goddesses; even
 if you could <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> for one.—But
 I really wanted your advice in good 
 earnest.</said>     
 </p>
 <p><said>If your case be desperate, you can

 you my advice gratis, in the formula of an

      he was sent for to attend <persName ref="#horton_0001">Mr. Horton</persName>,
      an intimate friend of his, a gentleman of
      great talents, and of the most active benevolence,
      who had just been seized with

      in saving the poor inhabitants of a

     <p><said>What a pity,</said> said <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>, as he

       before she mentioned his opinion to his pa-
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">273</fw>
       tient; and she earnestly hoped that no idea
       of putting herself into ignorant hands
       would recur to her ladyship.
      </p>
      <p><persName ref="#delacour_0002">Lord Delacour</persName>, in the morning, when
       he was sober, retained but a confused
       idea of the events of the preceding night;
       but he made an awkwardly good nature
       apology to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> for his intrusion,
       and for the disturbance he had occasioned,
       which he said, must be laid to the blame
       of <persName ref="#studley_0001">lord Studley's</persName> admirable <ecda:food>Burgandy</ecda:food>.—
       He expressed much concern for <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName>
       terrible accident, but he could
       not help observing, that if his advice had
       been taken, the thing could not have happened
       —that it was the consequence of
       her ladyship's self-willedness about the
       young <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>.
      </p>
      <p><said>How she got the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> without paying
      for them, or how she got money to
      pay for them, I know not,</said> said his <rs ref="#delacour_0002" type="person">lordship</rs>;
      <said>for I said I would have nothing
      to do with the business, and I have kept
      to my resolution.</said>    
      </p>
     <p>His <rs type="person" ref="#delacour_0002">lordship</rs> finished his morning visit
       to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, by observing that <said>the
       house would now be very dull for her; that
       the office of a nurse was ill-suited to so
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">274</fw>       
       young and beautiful a lady, but that her
       undertaking it with so much cheerfulness
       was a proof of a degree of good nature,
       that was not always to be met with in the
       young and handsome.</said>
     </p>
     <p>The manner in which <persName ref="#delacour_0002">lord Delacour</persName>
       spoke convinced <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, that he was in
       reality attached to his <rs ref="#delacour_0001" type="person">wife</rs>, however the
       fear of being, or of appearing to be governed
       by her ladyship might have 
       estranged him from her, and from home.—
       She now saw in him much more good sense,
       and symptoms of a more amiable character
       than his lady lady had described, or than she
       ever would allow that he possessed.
     </p>    
     <p>The reflections, however, which <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss
     Portman</persName> made upon the miserable life 
     this ill-matched couple led together
     did not incline her in favour of marriage 
     in general; great talents on one
     side, and good nature on the other, had,
     in this instance, tended only to make
     each party unhappy. Matches of interest,
     convenience, and vanity, she was 
     convinced diminished, instead of increasing
     happiness.—Of domestic felicity
     she had never, except during her childhood,
     seen examples—she had, indeed,
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">275</fw>
     heard from <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName> descriptions of the
     happy family of <persName ref="#anne_percival_0001">lady Anne Percival</persName>, but
     she feared to indulge the romantic hope
     of every being loved by a man of superior
     genius and virtue, with a temper
     and manners suited to her taste.—The
     only person she had seen, who at all
     answered this description, was <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>,
     and it was firmly fixed in her mind,
     that he was not a marrying man, and
     consequently not a man of whom any
     prudent woman would suffer herself to
     think with partiality. She could not doubt
     that he liked her society and conversation;
     his manner had sometimes expressed
     more than cold esteem.—<persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>
     had assured her that it expressed love;
     but <persName ref="ld">lady Delacour</persName> was  an imprudent woman
     in her own conduct, and not scrupulous
     as to that of others.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> was
     not guided by <emph>her</emph> opinions of propriety;
     and now that her ladyship was confined
     to her bed, and not in a position to give 
     her either advice or protection, she felt
     that it was peculiarly incumbent on her to
     guard, not only her conduct from reproach,
     but her heart from the hopeless
     misery of an ill-placed attachment.—She
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">276</fw>
     examined herself with firm impartiality—
     she recollected the excessive pain that she
     had endured, when she first heard <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence 
     Hervey</persName> say, that <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName>
     was a compound of art and affectation; but
     this she thought was only the pain of offended
     pride—of proper pride.—She recollected
     tthe extreme anxiety she had felt, 
     even within the last four and twenty hours,
     concerning the opinion which he might
     form of the transaction about the key of
     the boudoir—but this anxiety she justified
     to herself; it was due, she thought,
     to her reputation; it would have been inconsistent
     with female delicacy, to have
     been indifferent about the suspicions that
     necessarily arose from the circumstances
     in which she was placed.—Before <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
      had completed her self-examination, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
      Hervey</persName> called to inquire after <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady
      Delacour</persName>.—Whilst he spoke of her ladyship,
      and of his concerns for the dreadful
      accident, of which he believed himself
      to be in a great measured the cause, his
      manner and language were animated and
      unaffected; but the moment that this
      subject was exhausted, he became embarrassed;
      though he distinctly expressed
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">277</fw>
      perfect confidence and esteem for her, he
      seemed to wish, and yet to be unable to
      support the character of a friend, contradistinguished 
      to an admirer. He seemed
      conscious that he could not, with propriety,
      advert to the suspicious and jealousy
      which he had felt the preceding night;
      for a man who has never declared love
      would be absurd and impertinent, were
      he to betray jealousy.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> was destitute
      neither of address nor presence of 
      mind, but an accident happened, when
      he was just taking leave of <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>,
      which threw him into utter confusion.—
      It surprised, if it did not confound <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>.
      —She had forgotten to as, <persName ref="#dr_x_0001">Dr. X―</persName>   
       for his direction; and as she thought it
       might be necessary to write him concerning
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> health, she begged
       of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> to give it to her.—He took
       a letter out of his pocket, and wrote the
       direction with a pencil, but as he opened
       the paper, to tear off the outside, on which
       he had been writing, a lock of hair dropped 
       out of the letter; he hastily stooped
       for it, and as he took it up from the
       ground the lock unfolded.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>,
       though she cast but one involuntary, 
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">278</fw>
       hasty glance on it, was struck with the
       beauty of it's colour, and it's uncommon
       length.—The confusion of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
       convinced her, that he was extremely
       interested about the person to whom the
       hair belonged, and the species of alarm
       which she had felt at this discovery,
       opened her eyes effectually to the state of
       her own heart.—She was sensible that the
       sight of a lock of hair, however long, or
       however beautiful, in the hands of any
       man but <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, could not possibly
       have excited any emotion in her mind. 
       <said>Fortunately,</said> thought she, <said>I have
       discovered that he is attached to another,
       whilst it is yet in my power to command
       my affections, and he shall see that I am
       not so weak as to form any false expectations
       from what I must now consider as 
       mere commonplace flattery.</said> <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
       was glad that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> was not present
       at the discovery of the lock of hair,
       as she was aware that she would have 
       rallied her unmercifully upon the occasion;
       and she rejoiced that she had not been
       prevailed upon to give <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr"><persName ref="#pomenars_0001">madame la comtesse
       de Pomenars</persName></foreign> a lock of her <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">belle chevelure</foreign>.
       She could not help thinking,
         <pb/>
         <fw type="pageNum">279</fw>
       from the recollection of several minute
       circumstances, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> had
       endeavoured to gain an interest in her
       affections, and she felt that there would
       be great impropriety in receiving his ambiguous
       visits during <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> confinement
       to her room.—She therefore
       gave orders, that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> should not
       in future be admitted, till her ladyship
       should again see company. This precaution
       proved totally superfluous, for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr.
       Hervey</persName> never called again, during the
       whole course of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> confinement;
       though his <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="servant">servant</ecda:anonPers> regularly came
       every morning with inquiries after her
       ladyship's health.—She kept her room for
       about ten days: a confinement to which
       she submitted with extreme impatience:
       bodily pain she bore with fortitude, but
       constraint and ennui she could not endure.
     </p>
      <p>One morning as she was sitting up in
       bed, looking over a large collection of notes,
       and cards of enquiry after her health, she
       exclaimed—         
      </p>
      <p><said><seg xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003">These people will soon be tired of*

       hear the sound of music and dancing,
       and let the house be filled again, for Heaven's 
       sake.—<persName ref="#zimmerman_0001">Dr. Zimmerman</persName> should

       those who have not been used to it.—For 
       mercy's sake, <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>,</said> continued her
       ladyship, turning to <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>, who just
       then came softly into the room—<said>For 
       mercy's sake, don't walk to all eternity
       on tiptoes—to see people gliding about
       like ghosts makes me absolutely fancy myself
       amongst the shades below.—I would
       rather be stunned by the loudest peal,
       that ever thundering footman gave at my 
       door, than hear <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName> lock that bou-

      <p><said>Dear me! I never knew any lady that

         <said>Then 'tis plain,</said> said she, <said>who I'm to
         thank for this,</said> and as soon as she left the room her
           lady could not complain of her shutting

       —<said>for she is not bankrupt in sense.
       —O, three minutes won't do, I must allow

       reappeared, with a face which might 
       have sat for the picture of ill humour.
       Her ill humour, however, did not prevent
       her from attending her lady as usual; she
       performed all her customary offices with
       the most officious zeal, but in profound
       silence, except every now and then she
       would utter a sigh, which seemed to say,
       <said>See how much I'm attached to my lady,
       and yet my lady hates my <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>!</said> Her
        lady, who perfectly understood the language
        of sighs, and felt the force of <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott's</persName>,
       forebore to touch again on the tender
       subject of the <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>, hoping that when

           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">283</fw>
        pany, she should be relieved by more agreeable

       </p>
       <p>As soon as it was known that <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        was sufficiently recovered to receive
        company, her door was crowded with carriages;
        and as soon as it was understood
        that balls and concerts were to go on as 
        usual at her house, her <quote rend="quotes" source="#shakespeare_cleopatra">troop of friends</quote>
        appeared to congratulate her, and to amuse
        themselves.
       </p>
       <p><said>How stupid it is,</said> said <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
        to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>to hear congratulatory

        so sincerely, and so unjustly, that I really

        that would have been doing him an injury;
        for you know great philosophers tell us,

        changed?—Is not he grown pale and thing,
        and serious, not to say melancholy? What

       </p>
       <p><said>Nothing—I have never seen him.</said></p>
       <p><said>No! then the thing is accounted for
       very naturally—he is in despair, because
       he has been manished from your divine
       presence.</said>           
       </p>
      <p><said>More likely, because he has been in

      <p><said>I will find out the cause, let it be what

      </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding all her ladyship's address,
        her curiosity was baffled; she could
        not discover <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey's</persName> secret, and
       she began to believe, that the change which
       she had noticed in is looks and manner
       was imaginary or accidental. Had she
       seen more of him, at this time she would
       not have so easily given up her suspicions;
       but she saw him only for a few minutes
       every day, and during that time he talked
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">285</fw>
       to her with all his former gayety: besides
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had herself a daily part to
       perform, which occupied almst her whole
       attention. Notwithstanding the vivacity
       which she affected, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> perceived that
       she was now more seriously alarmed than
       she had ever been about her health. It
       was all that her utmost exertions could accomplish
       to appear for a short time in the 
       day—some evenings she came into company
       for only half an hour, on other days
       only for a few minutes, just walked
       through the rooms, paid her compliments
       to every body, complained of a nervous
       head-ache, left <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> to do the honours
       for her, and retired.          
      </p>
      <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Miss Portman</persName> was now really placed in
       a difficult and dangerous situation, and
       she had ample opportunities of learning
       and practising prudence.—<ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">All the fashionable
       dissipated young men in <placeName>London</placeName></ecda:persGroup> frequented
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour's</persName> house, and it was
       said, that they were drawn thither by the
       attractions of her fair representative. The
       <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">gentlemen</ecda:persGroup> considered a niece of <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">Mrs
       Stanhope's</persName> as their lawful prize. The
       <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female">ladies</ecda:persGroup> wondered that the <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">men</ecda:persGroup> could think
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName> a beauty; but whilst they
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">286</fw>
       affected to scorn, they sincerely feared her
       charms. Thus left entirely to her own
       discretion, she was exposed at once to the 
       malignant eye of envy, and the insidious
       voice of flattery—she had no friend, no
       guide, and scarcely a protector: her <persName ref="#selina_stanhope_0001">aunt
       Stanhope's</persName> letters, indeed, continually supplied 
       her with advice, but with advice
       which she could not follow consistently
       with her own feelings and principles.—
       <persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName>, even if she had been well,
       was not a person on whose counsels she
       could rely; our heroine was not one of
       those daring spirits, who are ambitious of
       acting for themselves; she felt the utmost
       diffidence of her own powers, yet at the
       same time a firm resolution not to be led
       even by timidity into follies, which the example
       of <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> had taught her to
       despise. <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda's</persName> prudence seemed to
       increase with the necessity for it's exertion.
       It was not the mercenary wily prudence of
       a young lady, who has been taught to
       think it virtue to sacrifice the affections of
       her heart to the interests of her fortune—
       it was not the prudence of a cold and selfish,
       but of a modest and generous woman.
       —She found it most difficult to satisfy her-
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">287</fw>
       self in her conduct towards <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>:
       he seemed mortified and miserable if
       she treated him merely as a common acquaintance,
       yet she felt the danger of admitting
       him to the familiarity of friendship;
       had she been thoroughly convinced that he
       was attached to some other woman, she
       hoped that she could freely converse with
       him, and look upon him as a married man,
       but notwithstanding the lock of beautiful
       hair, she could not entirely divest herself
       of the idea that she was beloved, when she
       observed the extreme eagerness with which
       <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> watched all her motions,
       and followed her with his eye as if his fate
       depended upon her. She remarked that
       he endeavoured as much as possible to
       prevent this species of attention from being
       noticed, either by the public or by herself;
       his manner towards her every day became
       more distant and respectful, more constrained
       and embarrassed; but now and
       then a different look and expression escaped.
       She had often heard of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr Hervey's</persName>
       great <emph>address</emph> in affairs of gallantry,
       and she was sometimes inclined to believe
       that he was trifling with her, merely for
       the glory of a conquest over her heart; at 
          <pb/>
          <fw type="pageNum">288</fw>
       other times she suspected him of deeper
       designs upon her, such as would deserve
       contempt and detestation; but upon the
       whole she was despised to believe, that he
       was entangled by some former attachment
       from which he could not extricate himself
       with honour; and upon this supposition
       she thought him worthy of her esteem,
       and of her pity.
      </p>
      <p>About this time <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName> began
       to pay a sort of lounging attention to 
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>—he knew that <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
        liked her, and this was the principle cause
        of his desire to attract her attention.—
        <said><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda Portman</persName></said> became his favourite
         toast, and amongst his companions he
         gave himself the air of talking of her with
         rapture.
      </p>
       <p><said><persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>,</said> said he, one day to his

          —<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary</persName> would look damned blue—hey?
          damned blue, and devilish small, and
          cursed silly too—hey?</said>           
       </p>
       <p><said>'Pon honour, I should like to see him,</said>
         said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>—<said>'pon honour he deserves
         it from us, <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Phil</persName>, and I'll stand your
         friend with the girl, and it will do no harm
             <pb/>
             <fw type="pageNum">289</fw>
         to give her a hint of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary's</persName> <rs type="properAdjective">Windsor</rs>
         flame—as a dead secret—'pon honour he
         deserves it from us.</said>
       </p>  
       <p>Now it seems that <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip Baddely</persName>
           and <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Mr. Rochfort</persName>, during the time of <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarrence
          Hervey's</persName> intimacy with them, observed 
           that he paid frequent visits at 
           <placeName>Windsort</placeName>, and they took it into their heads
           that he kept a mistress there. They were
           very curious to see her, and unknown to 
           <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, they made several attempts for
           this purpose; at last one evening, when
           they were certain that he was not at
           <placeName>Windsor</placeName>, they scaled the high garden wall
           of the house which he frequented, and 
           actually obtained a sight of a beautiful 
           <rs ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001" type="person">young girl</rs> and an <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">elderly lady</ecda:anonPers>, whom
           they took for her gouvernante. This adventure
           they kept a profound secret from
           <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, because they knew that he would
           have quarreled with them immediately,
           and would have called them to account 
           for their intrusion. They now determined 
           to avail themselves of their knowledge,
           and of his ignorance of this circumstnace;
           but they were sensible that it was necessary
           to go warily to work, lest they should
           betray themselves. Accordingly they be-
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">290</fw>
           gan by dropping distant mysterious hints
           about <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>, to <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>.—Such for instance 
           as—
       </p>
       <p><said>Damme, we all know <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary's</persName> a perfect
       connoisseur in beauty—hey, <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>
       —one beauty at a time is not enough
       for him—hey, damme? And it is not
       fashion, nor wit, nor elegance, and all
       that—that he looks for <emph>always</emph>.</said>
      </p>
      <p>These observations were accompanied
          with the most significant looks.—<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>
          heard and saw all this in painful silence,
          but <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> often used her address
          to draw some farther explanation from <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir
          Philip</persName>—his regular answer was—<said>No, no,
          your ladyship must excuse me there, I
          can't peach, damme—hey, <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>?</said>
      </p>
       <p>He was in hopes from the reserve with

           that he should, without making any
           distinct charge, succeed in disgusting her
           with his rival.—<persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> was about
           this time less assiduous than formerly in

           was there every day, and often for <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss

           <fw type="pageNum">291</fw>
           One morning, when <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName>
           happened to be present, the baronet
           thought it incumbent upon him to eclipse
           his rival in conversation, and began to
           talk of the last fête champêtre, at <placeName>Frogmore</placeName>.
       </p>
       <p><said>What a cursed unlucky overturn that
       was of yours, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>, with those
       famous young <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>—why—what with
       this sprain, and this nervous business,
       you've not been able to stir out since the

       and all that, at <placeName>Frogmore</placeName>—why all the

       for it, and you that had a card too—how

       </p>
       <p><said>I regret extremely that my illness

       —<persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> assured her that she felt no

       </p>
       <p><said>O, damme! but I would have driven

        was the finest sight and best conducted I 
       ever saw, and only wanted <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>
       to make it complete.—We had <ecda:persGroup>gipsies</ecda:persGroup>,
       and <persName ref="#mills_0001">Mrs. Mills</persName> the actress for the queen
           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">292</fw>
        of the gipsies; and she gave us a famous
        good song, <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, you know—and
        then there <emph>was</emph> <ecda:persGroup>two children</ecda:persGroup> upon an <ecda:fauna rend="italic">ass</ecda:fauna>,
        damme, I don't know how they came
        there, for they're things one sees every

        we had some famous glees—and <persName ref="#fawcett_0001">Fawcett</persName>
        gave us his laughing song, and then we
        had the launching of the ship, and ony it

        enough—but damme, the song of <persName ref="#polly_oliver_0001">Polly

        them—and after that, he sported a musquet
        and bayonet with the point of the

        dance, <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>, which was damned
        fine too—danced in boots and spurs by
        those <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-aig="hungarian"><rs type="properAdjective">Hungarian</rs> fellows</ecda:persGroup>—they jump and
        turn about, and clap their knees with

           <pb/>
           <fw type="pageNum">293</fw>
        of ways—and then we had that song of 
        <persName ref="#polly_oliver_0001">Polly Oliver</persName>, as I told you before, and
        <persName ref="#mills_0001">Mrs. Mills</persName> gave us—no, no—it was a

         you'd sing it like an angel—but where

         places built of brick, out in the air—and 
         then the entrance to the ball room was all

         and that sort of thing—and there was
         some bon mot (but that was in the morning)
         amongst the <ecda:persGroup>gipsies</ecda:persGroup> about an <ecda:flora ana="#food">orange</ecda:flora>,
         and the stadtholder—and then there was
         a <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> dance, and a <rs type="properAdjective">Polonese</rs> dance,
         all very fine, but nothing compared to 
         the <rs type="properAdjective">Pyrrhic</rs> touch, which was a great deal

       </p> 
       <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> assured <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> that

       <p><persName ref="#delacour_0001">Lady Delacour</persName> spoke with such polite

           did not suspect of her of irony: he eagerly
           began to exhibit the <rs type="properAdjective">Pyrrhic</rs> dance, but
           in such a manner, that it was impossible
           for human gravity to withstand the sight,
           —<persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName> laughed first, <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName>
           followed him, and <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> and

       </p>
       <p><said>Damme, now I believe you've all
       been quizzing me, damme,</said> cried the

       eyeing <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence Hervey</persName> and <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName>
       from time to time with what he meant 
       for a <emph>knowing</emph> look. His silence and sulkiness
       lasted till <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> took his leave.
       Soon afterward <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> retired to the

       a face of much importance; and after a

       said that his regard for his ladyship and
       <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss Portman</persName> made him wish to explain

       to the young lady, as <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>
       could have no serious intentions, because
       he had an attachment, to his certain

       </p>  
       <p>And then the <rs type="person" ref="#philip_baddely_0001">baronet</rs> described her
           after his manner.—<said>Where <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary</persName> keeps
          her now I can't make out, but he has
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">296</fw>
           taken her away from <placeName>Windsor</placeName>.—She was
           then with a <ecda:anonPers>gouvernante</ecda:anonPers>, and is as proud
           as the devil, which smells like matrimony
           for <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clary</persName>.</said>          
       </p>
        <p><said>And do you know this peerless damsel's
        name?</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Damme, I think the old <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#jezabel_0001">Jezabel</persName></ecda:anonPers> called
          her <persName ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001">miss St. Pierré</persName>—ay, damme—it
        was <persName ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001">Virginia</persName> too—<persName ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001">Virginia St. Pierre</persName>.</said>            
        </p> 
         <p><said><persName ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001">Virginia St. Pierre</persName>, a pretty romantic

         and I are extremely obliged by your
         attention to the preservation of our hearts
         —and I promise you we shall keep your
         council and our own.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">Sir Philip</persName> then, with more than his usual
          complement of oaths, pronounced <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">miss

          seen, and took his leave.            
        </p> 
        <p>When <persName ref="#delacour_0001">lady Delacour</persName> repeated this story
          to <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, she concluded by saying—
          <said>Now my dear, you know <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip
          Baddely</persName> has his own views in telling us

          hates <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>.—So I believe only half

              <fw type="pageNum">297</fw>
          love, I consider as a thing of no manner

        </p>
        <p><said>Of no manner of consequence to me,
        I assure your ladyship,</said> said <persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName>, <said>I 
        have always considered <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName> as—</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>O, as a common acquaintance, no

        speeches—I was going to say that this
        <quote>mistress of the wood</quote> can be of no consequence
        to your happiness, because whatever
        that fool <persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> may think, <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence
        Hervey</persName> is not a man to go and
        marry a girl who has been his mistress for
        half a dozen years—do not look so shocked,
        my dear, I really cannot help laughing
        —I congratulate you, however, that the
        thing is no worse—it is all in rule and in
        course—when a man marries he sets up
        new equipages, and casts off old mistresses
        ―or if you like to see the thing as woman
        of sentiment, rather than as a woman
        of the world, here is the prettiest opportunity
        for your lover's making a sacrifice.
        —I am sorry I cannot make you
        smile my dear—but consider, as nobody
        knows this naughty thing but ourselves,
        we are not called upon to bristle up our
        morality, and the most moral ladies in

            <fw type="pageNum">298</fw>
        the world do not expect men to be as 
        moral as themselves—so we may suit the
        measure of our external indignation to our
        real feelings—<persName ref="#philip_baddely_0001">sir Philip</persName> cannot stir in the
        business—for he knows <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName> would
        call him out, if his secret viz to <persName ref="#virginia_stpierre_0001">Virginia</persName>
        was to come to light—I advise you <foreign rend="italic">d'aller
        votre train</foreign> with <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Clarence</persName>, without seeming
        to suspect him in the least—there is
        nothing like innocence in these cases, my
        dear—but I know by the <rs type="properAdjective">Spansh</rs> haughtiness
        of your air at this instant, that you
        would sooner die the death of the sentimental
        —than follow my advice.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#belinda_portman_0001">Belinda</persName> without any haughtiness, but
        with firm gentleness, replied, <said direct="false">that she
        had no designs whatever upon <persName ref="#clarence_hervey_0001">Mr. Hervey</persName>,
        and that therefore there could be no
        necessity for any manœuvering on her part.
        —That the ambiguity of his conduct towards
        her had determined her long since
        to guard her affections, and that she had
        the satisfaction to feel, that they were entirely
        under her command.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>That is a great satisfaction indeed,
        my dear,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—<said>It is a
        pity that your countenance, which is 
        usually expressive enough, should not at 
        
        
        this instant obey your wishes and express
        perfect felicity—But though you feel no
        pain from disappointed affection, doubtless
        the concern that you show arises from
        the necessity you are under of withdrwaing
        a portion of your esteem from <persName ref="#ch">Mr.
        Hervey</persName>—that is the style for you, is it
        not!—After all, my dear, the whole may
        be a quizzification of <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName>—and yet
        he gave me such a minute description of
        her person!I am sure the man has not
        invention or taste enough to produce such
        a fancy piece.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Did he mention,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, in a
            low voice—<said>the colour of her hair?</said>
        </p> 
        <p><said>Yes—light brown—but the colour of 
        this hair seems to affect you more than all
        the rest.</said>            
        </p>
        <p>Here, to <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> great relief, the conversation
         was interrupted by the entrance of
         <persName ref="#marriott_0001">Marriott</persName>.—From all she heard, but
         especially from the agreement between the
         colour of the hair which dropped from
         <persName ref="#ch">Hervey's</persName> letter with <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip's</persName> description
         of <persName ref="#vs">Virginia's</persName>, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> was convinced
         that <persName ref="#ch">Clarence</persName> had some scret attachment;
         and she could not help blaming
         him in her own mind, for having, as she
         
         
         
         
         thought, endeavoured to gain her affections,
         whilst he knew that his heart was
         engaged to another.—<persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> however,
         gave her no farther reason to suspect
         him of any design to win her love; for
         about this time his manner towards her
         changed, he obviously endeavoured to
         avoid her; his visits were short, and his
         attention was principally directed to <persName ref="#ld">lady
         Delacour</persName>; when she retired, he took his
         leave, and <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName> had the field
         to himself.—The baronet, who thought
         that he had succeeded in producing a
         coldness between <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> and his rival,
         was surprised to find, that he could not
         gain any advantage for himself; for some
         time he had not the slightest thoughts of
         any serious connection with the lady, but
         at last he was piqued by her indifference,
         and by the raillery of his friend <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>.
        </p>
        <p><said>'Pon honour,</said> said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, <said>the
        <rs ref="#bp" type="person">girl</rs> must be in love with <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName>, for she
        minds you no more than if you were 
        nobody.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Damme, I could make her sing to
        another tune, if I pleased,</said> said <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>;
        <said>but damme, it would cost me too
        much—a wife's too expensive a thing,
        
        
        
        damme, nowadays.—Why a man could
        have twenty <ecda:commodity>curricles</ecda:commodity>, and a fine <ecda:commodity ana="#fauna">stud</ecda:commodity>,
        and a pack of <ecda:commodity ana="#fauna">hounds</ecda:commodity> and as many mistresses
        as he chooses into the bargain, for
        what it would cost him to take a wife.—
        O, damme, <persName ref="#bp">Belinda's</persName> a fine girl,
        but not worth so much as that comes to—
        and yet confound me, if I should not like
        to see how blue <persName ref="#ch">Clary</persName> would look, if I
        were to propose to her in good earnest—
        hey, <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>!—I should like to pay him
        for the way he served us about that quiz
        of a <rs ref="#rx" type="person">doctor</rs>, hey?</said>    
        </p>
        <p><said>Aye,</said> said <persName ref="#rochfort_0001">Rochfort</persName>, <said>you know he
        told us there was a <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">tant pis</foreign> and a <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">tant
        mieux</foreign> in every thing—he's not come to the
        <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">tant pis</foreign> yet.—'Pon honour, <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>,
        the thing rests with you.</said>            
        </p>
        <p>The <rs ref="#pb" type="person">Baronet</rs> vibrated for some time,
         between the fear of being taken in by one
         of <ecda:persGroup a-gender="female"><persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope's</persName> nieces</ecda:persGroup>, and the hope
         of triumphing over <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>.—
         At last, what he called love prevailed over
         prudence, and he was resolved, cost him
         what it would, to have <persName ref="#bp">Belinda Portman</persName>.
         He had not the least doubt of being accepted,
         if he made a proposal of marriage;
         consequenty, the moment that he
         
         
         
         came to this determination, he could not
         help assuming <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">d'avance</foreign> the tone of a favoured
         lover.
        </p>
        <p><said>Damme,</said> cried <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>, one night
         at <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour's</persName> concert, <said>I think

         if I give up this place, now I have got

        </p>
        <p><persName ref="#ch">Mr. Hervey</persName> did not contest his seat,

            favourably received; but he was, nevertheless,
            somewhat embarrassed to know
            how to begin the conversation, when he
            found himself alone with the lady.            
        </p> 
       <p>He twirled and twisted a short stick
           that he held in his hand, and put it into
           and out of his boot twenty times, and at 
           last he began with—

       </p>
      <p><said>That was a cursed unlucky overturn—
      she may thank <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName> for that
      —it's like him–he thinks he's a better
      
      
      
         judge of <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:food>wine</ecda:food>, and every
         thing else, than any body in the world—
         Damme now if I don't believe he thinks
         nobody else but himself has eyes enough
         to see a fine woman's a fine woman
         —but I'd have him know, that <persName ref="#bp">miss

           to the window, and back again, as if

      <p><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> looked at him with astonishment,

        <p><said>To prevent your giving yourself any

         said <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>—
        </p>
       <p><said>Nay, damme, don't catch at that unlucky

       for it's not what one meets with often,
       nowadays.—As to trouble, all I meant
       was, the trouble of writing to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
       which of course I thank you for
       saving me; for to be sure, damn it, I'd
       rather (and you can't blame me for that)
       have my answer from your own charming

        <p><said>To put an end to this heavenly sort of

         was confident of it's being his willing
         prize—<said>I must explicitly assure you,
         that it is not in my power to encourage
         your addresses.—I am fully sensible,</said> added
         <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, <said>of the Honour <persName ref="#pb">sir
         Philip Baddely</persName> has done me, and I hope
         he will not be offended by the frankness
         of my answer.</said>            
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p><said>You can't be in earnest, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>!</said>
         exclaimed the astonished <rs ref="#pb" type="person">barnet</rs>. 
      </p>
      <p><said>Perfectly in earnest, <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>.</said>
      </p>
      <p><said>Confusion seize me!</said> cried he, starting
          up, <said>if this isn't the most extraordinary
          thing I ever heard!—Will you do
          me the honour, madam, to let me know
          your particular objections to <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip
          Baddely</persName>.</said>          
      </p>
       <p><said>My objections,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>cannot
       be obviated, and therefore it would be
       useless to state them.</said>           
       </p>    
       <p><said>Nay—pray—ma'am—do me the favour
       —I only ask for information sake—is
       it to <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely's</persName> fortyne, <measure ana="#commodity #currency">15000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</measure>
       a year, you object, or to his family, or to
       his person.—O, curse it!</said> said he changing
       his tone, <said>you're only quizing me to
       see how I should look—damn me you did
       it too well, you little coquet.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><said><persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> again assured him that she was
       entirely in earnest, and that she was incapable
       of the sort of coquetry which he
       ascribed to her.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><said>O, damme, ma'am, then I've no more
       to say—a coquet is a thing I understand
       as well as another, and if we had been
       only talking in the air, it would have
       
       
       been another thing; but when I come at
       once to a proposal in form, and a woman
       seriously tells me she has objections that
       cannot be obviated, damme, what must
       I, or what must the world conclude, but
       that she's very unaccountable, or that
       she's engaged—which last I presume to
       be the case, and it would have been a satisfaction
       to me to have known it sooner
       —at any rate, it is a satisfaction to me to
       know it now.</said>           
       </p>
       <p><said>I am sorry to deprive you of so much
       satisfaction,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, <said>by assuring
       you, that I am not engaged to any 
       one.</said>           
       </p>
       <p>Here the conversation was interrupted
           by the entrance of <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, who
           came to inquire from <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> how
           his lady did. The baronet, after twisting
           his little black stick into all manner of
           shapes, finished by breaking it, and then
           having no other resource, suddenly wished
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> a good morning, and decamped
           with a look of silly ill humour.—
           He was determined to write to <persName ref="#ss">Mrs. Stanhope</persName>,
           whose influence over her niece he
           had no doubt would be decisive in his favour.
           <said><persName ref="#pb">Sir Philip</persName> seems to be a little out
           
           
           
           of sorts this morning,</said> said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>,
           <said>I am afraid he's angry with me for interrupting
           his conversation; but relaly I did
           not know he was here, and I wanted to
           catch you a moment alone, that I might,
           in the firstp lace, thank you for all your
           goodness to <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>—she has had a 
           tedous sprain of it; these nervous fevers
           and convulsions—I don't understand them,
           but I think <persName ref="#rx">Dr. X―'s</persName> prescriptions seem
           to have done her good, for she is certainly
           better of late, and I am glad to hear music
           and people again in the house, becaue I
           know all this is what my <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
           likes, and there is no reasonable indlulgence
           that I would not willingly allow a
           wife; but I think there is a medium in all
           things.—I am not a man to be governed 
           by a wife, and when I have once said a
           thing, I like to be steady, and always shall.
           And I am sure <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName> has too much
           good sense to think me wrong: for now,
           <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, in that quarrel about the
           <ecda:commodity>coach</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity">horses</ecda:fauna>, which you heard part of
           one morning at breakfast—I must tell you
           the beginning of that quarrel.</said>           
       </p>
        <p><said>Excuse me, my lord, but I would ra-
        
        
        
        
        ther hear of the end than of the beginning
        of quarrels.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>That shows your good sense as well
        s your good nature. I wish you could
        make my <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> of your taste—
        she does not want sense—but then (I speak
        to you freely of all that lies upon my mind,
        <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, for I know—I <emph>know</emph> you
        have no delight in making mischief in a
        house)—between you and me, her sense
        is not of the right kind.—A woman may
        have too much wit—now too much is as
        bad as too little, and in a woman, worse;
        and when two people come to quarrel, then
        wit on either side, but more especially on
        the wife's, you know, is very provoking—
        'tis like concealed weapons, which are
        wisely forbidden by law.—If a person kill
        another in a fray with a concealed weapon,
        ma'am, by a sword in a cane for instance,
        'tis murder by the law. Now even if it
        were not contrary to law, I would never
        have such a thing in my cane to carry
        about with me; for when a man's in a
        passion he forgets every thing, and would
        as soon lay about him with a swords as with
        a cane—so it is better such a thing should
        
        
        
        not be in his power. And it is the same
        with wit, which would be safest and best
        out of the power of some people.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>But is it fair, my lord, to make use of 
        wit yourself to abuse wit in others?</said> said
         <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> with a smile, which put his <rs ref="#md" type="person">lordship</rs>
         into perfect good humour with both
         himself and his lady. <said>Why really,</said> said
         he, <said>there would be no living with <persName ref="#ld">lady
         Delacour</persName>, if I did not come out with a little
         sly bit of wit now and then; but it is what 
         I am not in the habit of doing—I assure
         you, except when very hard pushed.—But,
         <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, as you like so much to hear
         the end of quarrels, here's the end of one
         which you have a particular right to hear
         something of,</said> continued his lordship,
         taking out his pocket-book and producing
         some <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">bank notes</ecda:commodity>—<said>you should have received
         this before, madam, if I had known
         of the transaction sooner—of your part of 
         it, I mean.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said><distinct type="dialect">Milord, de men call to speak about
        de <ecda:food ana="#commodity">burgundy</ecda:food> you order, milord</distinct>,</said> said
        <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName>, who came into the room with
         a sly inquisitive face.            
        </p>
        <p><said>Tell him I'll see him immediately—
        
        
        
        show him to the parlour, and give him a
        newspaper to read.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said><distinct type="dialect">Yes, milord—milord has it in his pocket
        since he dress</distinct>.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Here it is,</said> said his <rs type="person" ref="#md">lordship</rs>, and as
         <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> came forward to receive the
          newspaper, his eye glanced at the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">bank-
          notes</ecda:commodity>, and then at <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>.            
        </p>
        <p><said>Here,</said> continued <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, as
         <persName ref="#champfort_0001">Champfort</persName> had left the room—<said>here are
         your <measure ana="#currency #commodity">two hundred guineas</measure>, <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>,
         and as I am going to this man about my
         <ecda:food ana="#commodity">burgundy</ecda:food>, and shall be out all the rest of
         the day, let me trouble you the next time
         you see <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> to give her this
         pocket-book from me.—I should be sorry
         <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>, from any thing that has
         passed, should run away with the idea that
         I am a niggardly husband, or a tyrant,
         though I certainly like to be master in my
         own house.—What are you doing, madam?
         —that is your note, that does not go
         into the pocket-book, you know.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>Permit me to put it in, my lord,</said> said
            <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, returning the pocket-book to him,
            <said>and to beg you will give <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>
            the pleasure of seeing you; she has in-
            
            
            
            quired several times whether your lordship
            were at home. I will run up to her dressing
            room, and tell her that you are here.</said>            
        </p>
        <p><said>How lightly she goes, on the wings of
        good nature!</said> said <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName>, <said>I can
        do no less than follow her; for though I
        like to be treated with respect in my own
        house, there is a time for every thing.—I
        would not give <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> the trouble
        of coming down here to seem me with her
        sprained ancle, especially as she has inquired
        for me several times.</said>            
        </p>
        <p>His <rs ref="#md" type="person">lordship's</rs> visit was not of unseasonable
         length; for he recollected that the
         man who came about the <ecda:food ana="#commodity">burgundy</ecda:food> was
         waiting for him. But, perhaps, the shortness
         of the visit rendered it the mroe pleasing,
         for <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> afterward said to
          <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>—            
        </p>
        <p><said>My dear, would you believe it, my
        <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> was absolutely a perfect
        example of the useful and agreeable this
        morning—who knows but he may become
        the sublime and beautiful in time.—<foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">En attendant</foreign>
        here are your <measure ana="#currency #commodity">two hundred guineas</measure>,
        my dear <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>—a thousand thanks
        for the thing, and a million for the manner
        
        
        
        —manner is all in all in conferring favours.
        My lord, who, to do him justice, has too
        much honesty to pretend to more delicacy
        than he really possesses, told me that he
        had been taking a lesson from <persName ref="#bp">miss Portman</persName>
        this morning in the art of obliging;
        and really, for a grown gentleman, and for
        the first lesson, he comes on surprisingly.
        I do think, that by the time he is a widower,
        his lordship will be quite another
        thing—quite an agreeable man—not a genius,
        not a <persName ref="#ch">Clarence Hervey</persName>, that you cannot
        expect.—Apropos, what is the reason
        that we have seen so little of <persName ref="#ch">Clarence 
        Hervey</persName> lately? He has certainly some
        secret attraction elsewhere.—It cannot be
        that <rs ref="#vs" type="person">girl</rs> <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName> mentioned.—No—she's
        nothing new. Can it be at <persName ref="#ap">lady Anne
        Percival's</persName>?—or where can it be? Whenever
        he sees me I think he asks, when we
        go to <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>.—Now <placeName>Oakly-park</placeName> is
        within a few miles of <placeName>Harrowgate</placeName>. I will
        not go there, that's decided. <persName ref="#ap">Lady Anne</persName>
        is an exemplary matron, so she is out of
        the case; but I hope she has no <quote rend="italic" source="#richardson_grandison">sister excellence</quote>,
        no niece, no cousin, to entangle
        our hero.</said>            
        </p>
      
      
      
        
        
        
            
          <p><said><emph>Ours</emph>!</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>.              
          </p>
          <p><said>Well, <emph>yours</emph>, then,</said> said <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName>              
          </p>
          <p><said><emph>Mine</emph>!</said></p>
           <p><said>Yes, yours: I never in my life saw a
           better struggle between a sigh and a smile.
           But what have you done to poor <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip
           Baddely</persName>?—My <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> told me—
           you know all people who have nothing else
           to say, tell news quicker than others—my
           <persName ref="#md">lord Delacour</persName> told me, that he saw <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip</persName>
           part from you this morning in a terrible
           bad humour.—Come, whilst you tell your
           story, help me to string these pearls; that
           will save you from the necessity of looking
           at me, and will conceal your blushes—
           You need not be afraid of betraying <persName ref="#pb">sir
           Philip's</persName> secrets; for I could have told you
           long ago, taht he would inevitably propose
           for you—the fact is nothing new or surprising
           to me, but I should really like
           to hear how ridiculous the man
           made himself.</said>               
           </p>
           <p><said>And that,</said> said <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName>, <said>is the only
           thing which I do not wish to tell your ladyship.</said>               
           </p>
            <p><said>Lord, my dear, surely it is no secret
            
            
            
            that <persName ref="#pb">sir Philip Baddely</persName> is ridiculous—but
            you are so good natured that I can't be
            out of humour with you. If you won't
            gratify my curiosity, will you gratify my
            taste, and sing for me once more that
            charming song which none but you <emph>can</emph>
            sing to please me—I must learn it from
            you absolutely.</said>                
            </p>
            <p>Just as <persName ref="#bp">Belinda</persName> was beginning to sing,
              <persName ref="#m">Marriott's</persName> <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna> began to scream, so
               that <persName ref="#ld">lady Delacour</persName> could not hear any
                thing else.                 
            </p>
            <p><said>O, that odious <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>!</said> cried her
              <rs ref="#ld" type="person">ladyship</rs>, <said>I can endure it no longer</said>—
              and she rang her bell violently—<said>It kept

              <measure ana="#currency #commodity">five</measure> with the greatest pleasure to get rid of
              it, for it is the torment of my life.</said>                
            </p>
             <p><said>Dear my lady! I can assure you it is
