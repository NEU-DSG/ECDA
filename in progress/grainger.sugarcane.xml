                 name of the <ecda:flora>Cane</ecda:flora> is <distinct type="dialect" xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">Saccharum</distinct>. The
                 <name>Greeks</name> and <name>Romans</name> seem to have known very little of this most useful and beautiful
                 plant. <persName ref="#lucan_0039">Lucan</persName> and <persName ref="#pliny_0023">Pliny</persName> are the only authors among the former who mention it; and
                 so far as I can find, <persName ref="#arrian_0086">Arrian</persName> is the only <name>Greek</name>. The first of these Writers, in enumerating
                 <persName ref="#pompey_0106">Pompey's</persName> Eastern auxilaries, describes a nation who made use of the <ecda:food ana="#ana_flora #ana_use">Cane-
                 juice</ecda:food> as a drink:
                 <quote xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)type(block)">Dulces bibebant ex arundine succos</quote>
                 The industrious Naturalist says, <distinct xml:lang="la">Saccharum et Arabia fort, sed laudatius India</distinct>; and
                 the <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> Historian, in his <distinct xml:lang="el">περεπλους</distinct> of the <geogName>Red-sea</geogName>, tells us of the neighbouring nation
                 who drank it also; his words are <distinct xml:lang="el"><!-- Include Greek here --></distinct>.
                 The <ecda:flora ana="#ana_cultivation">Cane</ecda:flora>, however, as it was a native of the East, so has it been probably 
                 cultivated there time immemorial. The raw juice was doubtless first made use of;
                 they afterwards boiled it into a syrup; and, in process of time, and inebriating
                 spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation. This conjecture is confirmed by the 
                 etymology, for the Arabic word <distinct type="dialect"><!-- arabic --></distinct> is evidently derived from the Hebrew <distinct type="dialect"><!-- hebrew --></distinct>
                 which signifies an <soCalled>intoxicating liquor</soCalled>. When <name>Indians</name> began to make the Cane-
                 juice into sugar, I cannot discover; probably, it soon found its way into <placeName>Europe</placeName>
                 in that <unclear>form</unclear>, first by the <geogName>Red-sea</geogName>, and afterwards through <placeName>Persia</placeName>, by the <geogName>Black-sea</geogName> and
                 <geogName>Caspian</geogName>; but the plant itself was not known to <placeName>Europe</placeName>, till the <name>Arabians</name> introduced
                 it into the southern parts of <placeName>Spain</placeName>, <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, and those provinces of <placeName>France</placeName> which bor­
                 
                 <!-- Insert pb info and links here -->
                 
                 der on the <geogName>Pyrenean mountains</geogName>. It was also successfully cultivated in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and in many
                 places on the <geogName>Barbary-coast</geogName>. From the <geogName>Mediterranean</geogName>, the <name>Spaniards</name> and <name>Portuguese</name>
                 transported the Cane to the <placeName><unclear>Azores</unclear></placeName>, the <placeName>Madeiras</placeName>, the <placeName>Canary</placeName> and the <placeName>Cape-Verd
                 islands</placeName>, soon after they had been discovered in the fifteenth century and in most of
                 these, particularly <placeName>Madeira</placeName>, it throve exceedingly. Weather the Cane is a native
                 of either the <placeName>Great</placeName> or <placeName>Lesser Antilles</placeName> cannot now be determined for their discoverers
                 were so wholly employed in searching after imaginary gold-mines, that they took
                 little or no notice of the natural productions. Indeed the wars, wherein they wantonly
                 engaged themselves with the natives, was another hindrance to physical investigation.
                 But whether the <ecda:flora>Cane</ecda:flora> was a production of the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName> or not, it is
                 probably the <name>Spaniards</name> and <name>Portuguese</name> did not begin to cultivate it either there or in
                 <placeName>South America</placeName> (where it certainly was found), till some years after their discovery.
                 It is also equally uncertain whether Sugar was first made in the Islands or on the Continent,
                 and whether the <name>Spaniards</name> or <name>Portuguese</name> were the first planters in the new world:
                 it is indeed most likely that the latter erected the first sugar-works in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, as they are
                 more lively and enterprizing than the <name>Spaniards</name>. However they had not long the start
                 of the latter; for in <date>1506</date> <persName ref="#ferdinand_ii_aragon_1479">Ferdinand the Catholic</persName> ordered the Cane to be carried from
                 the <placeName>Canaries</placeName> to <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>, in which island one <persName>Pedro de Atenca</persName> soon after built an
                 <distinct type="dialect">Ingenio de açucar</distinct> for so the <name>Spaniards</name> call a Sugar-work. But, though they began thus
                 early to turn their thoughts to sugar, the <name>Portuguese</name> far outstripped them in that trade;
                 for <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> soon supplied most of <placeName>Europe</placeName> with a commodity; and notwithstanding
                 the <name>English</name> then paid the <name>Portuguese</name> at the rate of <measure commodity="sugar">4l per C. wt.</measure> for <ecda:commodity ana="#flora #food">muscovado</ecda:commodity>, yet that
                 priece, great as it may now appear, was probably much less than what the Sugar from the
                 <placeName>East-Indies</placeName> had commonly been sold for. Indeed, so intent was the <orgName>Crown of Portugal</orgName>
                 on extending their <name><placeName>Brazil</placeName>-trade</name>, that that of the <placeName>East-Indies</placeName> began to be neglected, and
                 soon suffered a manifest decay. However, their sugar made them ample amends,
                 in which trade they continued almost without a rival for upwards of a century. At last
                 the <name>Dutch</name>, in <date>1623</date>, drove the <name>Portuguese</name> out of all the northern part of <placeName>Brazil</placeName>; and,
                 during one and twenty years they kept that conquest, those industrious republicans
                 learned the art making sugar. This probably inspired the <name>English</name> with a desire
                 
                 <!-- Insert page and link information here -->
                 
                 of coming in for a share of the sugar-trade; accordingly they, renouncing their chimerical
                 search after gold mines in <placeName>Florida</placeName> and <placeName>Guiana</placeName>, settled themselves soon after the
                 mouth of the <geogName>river Surinam</geogName>, where they cultivated the Cane with such success, that when
                 the colony was ceded to the <name>Dutch</name> by the <name>treaty of <placeName>Breda</placeName></name>, it maintained not less than
                 40,000 <name>Whites</name>, half of that number of slaves, as employed one year with another 15,000
                 ton of shipping. This cession was a severe blow to the <name><rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>-trade</name>, which did not
                 recover for several years, though many of the <rs type="properAdjective">Surinam</rs> Planters carried their art and <name>Negroes</name>
                 to the <placeName>Leeward Islands</placeName> and <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, which then began to be the object of political
                 consideration in <placeName>England</placeName>.

                 Sugar is twice mentioned by <persName ref="geoffrey_chaucer_1343">Chaucer</persName>, who flourished in the fourteenth century;
                 and succeeding poets, down to the middle of the last, use the epithet <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">Sugar'd</soCalled>, whenever
                 they woud express any thing uncommonly pleasing: since that time, the
                 more elegant writers seldom admit of that adjective in a metaphorical sense; but
                 herein perhaps they are affectedly squeamish.

                 The red requires a better mould, and always emits a disagreeable smell before rain.
                 The wood of both are highly useful for many mechanical purposes, and but too little

                 peels easily off, and discovers a butyraceous, or rather a marrowy like substance, with

                 bear fruit but once a year. Few strangers care for it; but, by use, soon become fond
                 of it. The juice of the kernel marks linen with a violet colour. Its wood is soft

                 in his second voyage, <date>1493</date>, who was so pleased with his appearance, that he honoured
                 it with his <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> name. Though others pretend, that appellation was given it from
                 an imaginary resemblance between a high mountain in its centre, now called <geogName>Mount Misery</geogName>
                 to the fabulous legend of the Devil's carrying <!--<persName>St. Christopher</persName>--> on his shoulders.
                 But, be this as it will, the <name>Spaniards</name> soon after settled it, and lived in tolerable harmony
                 with the natives for many years; and as their fleets commonly called in there to
                 and from <placeName>America</placeName> for provision and water, the settlers, no doubt, reaped some
                 advantage from their situation. By <!-- Templeman's Survey -->, it contains eighty square miles,
                 and is about seventy miles in circumference. It is of an irregular oblong figure, and
                 has a chain of mountains, that run South and North almost from the one end of it to 
                 the other, formerly covered with wood, but now the Cane plantations reach almost to
                 their summits, and extend all the way, down their easy declining sides, tothe sea, From
                 these mountains some rivers take their rise, which never dry up; and there are many
                 others which, after rain, run into the sea, but which, at other times, are lost before
                 they reach it. Hence, as this land consists of mountain-land and valley, it must always
                 make a midling crop; for when the low grounds fail, the uplands supply that deficiency;
                 and, when the mountain canes are lodged (or become watery from too much
                 rain) those in the plains yield surprisingly. Nor are the plantations here only seasonable,
                 their Sugar sells for mor than the Sugar of any other of his Majesty's islands; as

                 muscovado. In the barren part of the island, which runs out towards <placeName>Nevis</placeName>, are several
                 ponds, which in dry weather crystallize into good salt; and below <geogName>Mount Misery</geogName> is
                 a small Solfaterre, and collection of fresh water, where fugitive <name>Negroes</name> often take
                 shelter, and escape their pursuers. Not far below is a large plain which affords good
                 pasture, water, and wood; and, if the apporaches thereto were fortified, which might
                 be done at a moderate expence, it would be rendered inaccessible. The <name>English</name>,
                 repulsing the few natives and <name>Spaniards</name>, who opposed them, began to plant tobacco
                 here A.D. 1623. Two years after, the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>-settlers received a considerable reinforcement from their
                 mother-country; and, the chiefs of both nations, being men of sound policy, entered 
                 into an agreement to divide the island between them: the <name>French</name> retaining
                 both extremities, and the <name>English</name> possessing themselves of the middle parts of the island.
                 Some time after both nations erected sugar-works, but there were more tobacco, indigo,
                 coffee, and cotton-plantations, than Sugar ones, as these require a much greater fund to
                 carry them on, than those other. All the planters, however, lived easy in their circumstances;
                 for, though the <name>Spaniards</name>, who could not bear to be spectators of their thriving
                 condition, did repossess themselves of the island, yet they were soon obliged to
                 retire, and the colony succeeded better than ever. One reason for this, was that it had
                 been agreed between the two nations, that they should here remain neutral whatever
                 wars their mother-counties might wage against each other in Europe. This was
                 a wise regulation for an instant settlement; but, when <persName ref="james_vi_i_1566">King James</persName> abdicated the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs>
                 throne, the <name>French</name> suddenly rose, and drove out the unprepared <name>English</name> by
                 force of arms. The <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> colonists of <placeName>St. Christopher</placeName> had soon reason, however to
                 repent their impolitic breach of faith; for the expelled planters, being assisted by their
                 countrymen from the neighbouring isles, and supported by a formidable fleet, soon recovered,
                 not only their lost plantations, but obliged the french totally to abandon
                 the island. Ager the <name>treaty of <placeName>Ryswick</placeName></name>, indeedm some few of those among them, who
                 had not obtained settlements in <placeName>Martinico</placeName> and <placeName>Hispaniola</placeName>, returned to <placeName>St.
                 Chrisopher</placeName>: but the war of the partition soon after breaking out, they were finally expelled,
                 and the whole island was ceded in Sovereignty to the crown of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, by the
                 <name>treaty of <placeName>Utrecht</placeName></name>. Since that time, <placeName>St. Christopher</placeName> has gradually improved, and it
                 is now at the height of perfection. The Indian name of <placeName>St. Christopher</placeName> is <distinct type="dialect"><rs type="place">Liamuiga</rs></distinct>,

                 when the <name>English</name> first landed there, which was about the end of the sixteenth or beginning
                 of the seventeenth century, they found in it an excellent breed of wild hogs,

                 for his waving his claim to <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>, which he had obtained, by patent, in the
                 preceding reign. The adventurers to whom that nobleman parcelled out this island, at
                 first cultivated tobacco; but, that not turning out to their advantage, they applied,
                 with better success, to cotton, indigo, and ginger. At last, some cavaliers of good
                 fortune transporting themselves thither, and introducing the Sugar-cane [A. D. 1647]
                 probably from <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, in ten years time the island was peopled with upwards of
                 30,000 <name>Whites</name>, and twice that number of <name>Negroes</name>, and sent yearly very considerable
                 quantities of sugar to the mother-country. At the Restoration, <persName ref="#charles_ii_england_1630">King Charles II.</persName>
                 bought off the claim of the <name>Carlisle</name>-family; and, in the consideration of its then

                 4 ½ per cent. on their sugars; which duty still continues, although the island is said to 
                 be less able to pay it now than it was a hundred years ago. It is upwards of 20 miles

                 are very troublesome, especially to strangers, whom they bite unmercifully, causing

                 Though natives of the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, they are not less common in the coldest

                 attendents on the snowy summit of certain mountains within the arctic circle. They,
                 however, chiefly love shady, moist, and warm places. Accordingly they are commonest
                 to be met with in the corners of rooms, towards evening, and before rain. They are
                 so light, as not to be felt when they pitch on the skin; and, as soon as they have darted
                 in their proboscis, fly off, so that the first intimation one has being bit by them, is
                 the itching tumour. Warm lime-juice is its remedy. The Mosquito makes a

                 There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the
                 juice; this the <name>French</name> call Camagnoc. The colour of its root is white, like a
                 parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By 
                 coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the <name>Indians</name> prepare
                 many wholesom dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour 
                 without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects
                 I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and,
                 being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob.
                 Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The <name>French</name> name it <soCalled><foreign>Manihot</foreign></soCalled>,

                 Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the

                 that the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> chocolate had not a tempting aspect; yet I doubt whether the
                 <name>Europeans</name> have greatly improved its wholesomeness, by the addition of vanellas and
                 other hot ingredients. The tree often grows fifteen or twenty feet high, and is
                 streight and handsome. The pods which seldom contain less than thirty nuts of
                 the size of a flatted olive, grow upon the stem and principal branches. The tree
                 loves a moist, rich, and shaded soil: Hence those who plant cacao-walks, sometimes
                 screen them by a hardier tree, which the <name>Spaniards</name> aptly term <soCalled><foreign>Madre de Cacao</foreign></soCalled>.
                 They may be planted fifteen or twenty feet distant, though some advise to plant
                 them much nearer, and perhaps wisely; for it is an easy matter to thin them, when
                 they are past the danger of being destroyed by dry weather, &amp;c. Some recommend
                 planting cassada, or bananas, in the intervals, when the cacao-trees are young,
                 to destroy weeds, from which the walk cannot be kept too free. It is generally
                 three years before they produce good pods; but in six years, they are in highest
                 perfection. The pods are commonly of the size and shape of a large cucumber.
                 There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour 
                 and goodness of their nuts. That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. None

                 <label>Ver. 74</label> <ref>Dread alligators]</ref> This dreadful animal is amphibious, and seldom lays
                 fewer than 100 eggs. These she carefully covers with sand. But, notwithstanding
                 this precaution, the gallinazo (a large species of carrion crow) conceals itself among
                 the thick boughs of the nieghbouring trees, and thus often discovers the hoard of the
                 alligator which she no sooner leaves, than the gallinazo souses down upon it, and
                 greedily scraping off the sand, regales on its contents. Nor is the male alligator less
                 an enemy to the increase of his own horrid brood, than these useful birds; for, when
                 instinct prompts the female to let her young fry out by breaking the eggs. he never 
                 fails to accompany her and to devour as many of them as he can: So that the mother
                 scarece ever escapes into the river with more than five out of all her hundred. Thus
                 providence doubly prevents the otherwise immense propacation of that voracious animal,
                 on the banks of the river <geogName>Guayaquil</geogName>; for the gallinazo is not always found,
                 where alligators are. <bibl rend="ital"><author><persName ref="#francisco_de_ulloa_0001">Ulloa</persName></author>.</bibl>

                 put an end to his life, by that means, he failed in his purpose. So, at least, <persName ref="#pliny_0023">Pliny</persName>
                 informs us. But we happily are not obliged to believe, implicitly, whatever that elaborate
                 compiler has told us. When poisons immediately operate on the nervous
                 system, and their effects are to be expelled by the skin, this electuary is no contemptible
                 antidote. But how many poisons do we know at present, which produce their 
                 effects in a different manner? and, from the <sic>acounts</sic> of authors, we have reason to
                 be persuaded, that the antients were not much behind us in their variety of poisons.
                 If, therefore, the King of Pontus had really intended to have destroyed himself, he 
                 could have been at no loss for the means, notwithstanding the daily use of this antidote.

                 <label>Ver. 438.</label> <ref>the bending coco's]</ref> The coco-nut tree is of the palm genus; there are
                 several species of them, which grow naturally in the Torrid Zone. The coco-nut tree
                 is, by no means, so useful as travellers have represented it. The wood is of little
                 or no service, being spungy, and the brown covering of the nuts is of too rough a
                 texture to serve as apparel. The shell of the nut receives a good polishl and having
                 a hantle to put to it, is commonly used to drink water out of. The milk or water 
                 of the nut, is cooling and pleasant; but, if drunk too freely, will frequently occasion
                 a pain in the stomach. A salutary oil may be extracted from the kernel; which, if
                 old, and eaten too plentifully, is apt to produce a shortness of breathing. A species
                 of arrack is made from this tree, in the <placeName>East-Indies</placeName>. The largest coco-nut trees grow
                 on the banks of the <geogName>river Oronoko</geogName>. They thrive best near the sea, and look beautiful
                 at a distance. They afford no great shide. Ripe nuts have been produced from
                 them in three years after planting. The nuts should be macerated in water, before
                 they are put in the ground. <distinct type="dialect">Coco</distinct> is an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> name; the <name>Spaniards</name> call it also
                 <distinct type="dialect">palma de las Indias</distinct>; as the smallest kind, whose nuts are less than walnuts, is termed
                 by them <distinct type="dialect">Coquillo</distinct>. This grows in <placeName>Chili</placeName>, and the nuts are esteemed more delicate
                 than those of a larger size. In the <placeName>Maldivy-Islands</placeName>, it is pretended. they not only
                 build houses of the coco-nut tree, but also vessels, with all their rigging; nay, and
                 load them too with wine, oil, vinegar, black sugar, fruit, and strong water, from
                 the same tree. If this be true, the <rs type="properAdjective">Maldivian</rs> coco-nut trees must differ widely from
                 those that grow in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>. The coco must not be confounded with the
                 coco-nut tree. That shrub grows in the hottest and postest vales of the Andes. Its
                 leaf, which is gather two or three times a year, is much coveted by the natives of 
                 <placeName>South-America</placeName>, who will travel reat journeys upon a single handful of the leaves,
                 which they do not swallow, but only chew. It is of an unpleasant taste, but, by use,
                 soon grows agreeable. Some authors have also confounded the coco-nit palm, with
                 the coco, or chocolate tree. The <name>French</name> call the coco-nut tree, <distinct xml:lang="fr" type="dialect">Cocotier,</distinct>. Its
                 stem, which is very lofty, is always bent; for which reason it looks better in an
                 orchard than in a regular garden. As one limb fades, another shoots up in the center,
                 like a pike. The botanical name is <distinct type="scientific">Palma indica, coccifera, angulosa</distinct>.

                 innocent; but the slightest wound made by an arrow, whose point is tinged therewith, 
                 proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood from the body immediately 
                 to the heart, it forthwith bursts it. The fish and birds killed by these poisoned arrows
                 (in the use of which the Indians are astonishingly expert) are perfectly wholesome
                 to feed on. See <persName ref="#francisco_de_ulloa_0001">Ulloa</persName> and <persName ref="#charles_condamine_1701">De la Condamine's</persName> account of the great <placeName>river

           <head rend="case(allcaps)">Preface</head>
           <p>Soon after my arrival in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, I conceived the de-
              sign of writing a poem on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane.
              My inducements to this arduous undertaking were, not only the 
              importance and novelty of the subject, but more especially this consideration; 
              that, as the face of the country was wholly different
              from that of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, so whatever hand copied its appearances,
              however rude, could not fail to enrich poetry with many new and
              picturesque images.
           </p>
           <p>I cannot, indeed, say I have satisfied my own ideas in
              this particular: yet I must be permitted to recommend the precepts
              contained in this Poem. They are the children of Truth, not of 
              Genius; the result of Experience, not the productions of Fancy.
              Thus, though I may not be able to please, I shall stand some
              chance of instructing the Reader; which, as it is the nobler end of
              all poetry, so should it be the principal aim of every writer who
              wishes to be thought a good man.
           </p>
           <p>It must, however, be observed, that, though the general precepts 
              are suited to every climate where Cane will grow; yet,
              the more minute rules are chiefly drawn from the practice of St.
              Christopher. Some selection was necessary; and I could adopt no
              
              
              
              modes of planting, with such propriety, as those I had seen practised 
              in that island, where it was been my good fortune chiefly to
              reside since I came to the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>.
           </p>
           <p>I have often been astonished, that so little has been published
              on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane, while the press has groaned
              under folios on every other branch of rural <sic>oeconomy</sic>. It were
              unjust to suppose planters were not solicitous for the improvement
              of their art, and injurious to assert they were incapable of obliging
              mankind with their improvements.
           </p>
           <p>And yet except some scattered hints in <persName ref="#jeanbaptiste_labat_1663">Pere Labat</persName>, and other
              <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> travellers in <placeName>America</placeName>; an Essay by <persName ref="samuel_martin_1694">Colonel Martyn</persName> of <placeName>Antigua</placeName>, 
              is the only piece on plantership I have seen deserving a perusal. 
              That gentleman's pamphlet is, indeed, an excellent performance; 
              and to it I own myself indebted.
           </p>
           <p>It must be confessed, that terms of art look awkward in poetry;
              yet didactic compositions cannot wholly dispense with them. Accordingly 
              we find that <persName ref="hesiod_0001">Hesiod</persName> and <persName ref="#virgil_0070">Virgil</persName>, among the ancients with
              <persName ref="#john_philips_1676">Philips</persName> and <persName ref="#john_dyer_1699">Dyer</persName>, (not to mention some other poets now living in
              our own country); have been obliged to insert them in their poems.
              Their example is a sufficient apology for me, for in their steps I
              shall always be proud to tread.
           </p>
           
           <lg type="poem" xml:lang="la">
              <l>Vos sequor ô Gracaiæ gentis decus inque vestris nunc</l>
              <l>Fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis;</l>
              <l>Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amoreum</l>
              <l>Quod imitari aveo.—</l>
           </lg>
           <p>Yet, like them too, I have generally preferred the way of description, 
              wherever that could be done without hurting the subject.
           </p>
           <p>Such words as are not common in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, I have briefly ex­
              plained: because an obscure poem affords both less pleasure and 
              profit to the reader.—For the same reason, some notes have been
              added, which, it is presumed will not be disagreeable to those
              who have never been in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>.
           </p>
           <p>In a <rs type="properAdjective">West-India</rs> georgic, the mention of many indigenous
              remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is,
              I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided
              them. Medicines of such amazing efficacy, as I have had occasion
              to make trials of in these islands, deserve to be universally known.
              And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I
              beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not a poet

              <p>Hymn to the month of <name>January</name>, when <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">crop</unclear> begins. Address. Planters have
                  employment all the year round. Planters should be pious. A ripe Cane piece
                  on fire at midnight. Crop begun. Cane cutting described. Effects of
                  music. Greate care requisite in feeding the mill. Humanity towards the 
                  <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">maimed</unclear> recommended. The tainted Canes should not be ground. Their
                 use. How to preserve the laths and mill-points from sudden squalls.
                 Address to the Sun, and praise of <placeName>Antigua</placeName>. A cattle-mill described.
                 Care of mules &amp;c. Diseases to which they are subject. A water-mill
                 the least liable to interruption. Common in <placeName>Guadaloupe</placeName> and <placeName>Martinico</placeName>.
                 Praise of <persName ref="#charles_marsham_1744" cert="medium">Lord Romney</persName>. The necessity of a strong, clear fire, in boiling. 
                 Planters should always have a spare set of vessels to melt. The danter of throwing
                 cold water into a thorough-heated furnace. Cleanliness, and skimming
                 well, recommended. A boiling-house should be lofty, and open at 
                 top, to the leeward. Constituent parts of vegetables. Sugar an essential
                 salt. What retards its granulation. How to forward it. Dumb Cane.
                 Effects of it. Bristol-lime the best temper. Various uses of Bristol lime.
                 Good muscovado described. Bermudas-lime recommended. The Negroes
                 should not be hindered from drinking the hot liquor. The chearfulness
                 and healthiness of Negroes in crop time. Boilers to be encouraged. 
                 They snould neither boil the sugar too little, nor too much. When the 
                 Sugar is of too loose a grain, and about to boil over the teach, or last
                 copper, a little crease settles it, and makes it a boil closer. The <name>French</name>
                 often mix sand with their Sugars. This practice not followed by the <name>English</name>.
                 A character. Of skimmings. Their various uses. Of rum. Its
                 praise. A <rs type="properAdjective">West-India</rs> prospect, when crop is finished. An address to the
                 <name>Creoles</name>, to live more upon their estates than they do. The reasons.

              <ab>Invocation to the Genius of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. Negroes when bought should
                 be young, and strong. The Congo-negroes are fitter for the house and
                 trades, than for the field. The Gold-Coast, but especially the Papaw-
                 negroes, make the best field negroes: but even these, if advanced in years,
                 should not be purchased. The markes of a sound negroe at a negroe sale.
                 Where the men do nothing but hunt, fish or fight, and all field drudgery
                 is left to the women; these are to be preferred to their husbands. The
                 <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">Minnahs</unclear> make good tradesmen, but <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">addicted to suicide</unclear>. The Mundigos,
                 in particular, subject to worms; and the Congas, to dropsical disorders.
                 How salt-water, or new negroes should be seasoned. Some negroes eat
                 dirt. Negroes should be habituated by gentle degrees to field labour. This
                 labour, when compared to that in lead-mines, or of those who work in the
                 gold and silver mines of <placeName>South America</placeName>, is not only less toilsome, but far
                 more healthy. Negroes should always be treated with humanity. Praise
                 of freedom. Of the dracunculus, or dragon worm. Of chigres. Of
                 the <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">yaws</unclear>. Might not this disease be imparted by <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">inoculation</unclear>? Of worms,
                 and their mulitform appearance. Praise of commerce. Of the imaginary
                 disorders of negroes, especially those caused by their conjurers or Obia-
                 men. The composition and supposed virtues of a magic-phiol. Field-negroes
                 should not begin to work before six in the morning, and should leave off between
                 eleven and twelve; and beginning again at two, should finish before sunset.
                 Of the weekly appearance of negroes. The young, the old, the
                 sickly, and even the lazy, must have their victuals prepared for them.
                 Of negroe-ground, and its various productions. To be fenced in, and
                 watched. Of an American garden. Of the situation of the negroe-huts.
                 How best defended from fire. The great negroe-dance described. Drumming,
                 and intoxicating spirits not to be allowed. Negroes should be
                 made to marry in their masters plantation. Inconvenciences arising from
                 the contrary practice. Negroes to be cloathed once a year, and before
                 Christmas. Praise of <persName ref="louis_xiv_1638">Lewis XIV.</persName> for the Code Noir. A body of laws
                 of this kind recommended to the English sugar colonies. Praise of the
                 river Thames. A moonlight landscape and vision.
