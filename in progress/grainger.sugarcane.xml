                 <label rend="case(smallcaps)">Ver.22</label> <hi rend="slant(italic)">the spiry <ecda:flora ana="#ana_harv">Cane</ecda:flora>,</hi>] The botanical
                 name of the <ecda:flora>Cane</ecda:flora> is <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">Saccharum</foreign>. The
                 <name>Greeks</name> and <name>Romans</name> seem to have known very little of this most useful and beautiful
                 plant. <persName>Lucan</persName> and <persName>Pliny</persName> are the only authors among the former who mention it; and
                 so far as I can find, <persName>Arrian</persName> is the only <name>Greek</name>. The first of these Writers, in enumerating
                 <persName>Pompey's</persName> Eastern auxilaries, describes a nation who made use of the <!-- food --> Cane-
                 juice as a drink:
                 <quote xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)type(block)">Dulces bibebant ex arundine succos</quote>
                 The industrious Naturalist says, <foreign xml:lang="la">Saccharum et Arabia fort, sed laudatius India</foreign>; and
                 the <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> Historian, in his <foreign xml:lang="el">περεπλους</foreign> of the <geogName>Red-sea</geogName>, tells us of the neighbouring nation
                 who drank it also; his words are <foreign xml:lang="el"><!-- Include Greek here --></foreign>.
                 The <ecda:flora>Cane</ecda:flora>, however, as it was a native of the East, so has it been probably 
                 cultivated there time immemorial. The raw juice was doubtless first made use of;
                 they afterwards boiled it into a syrup; and, in process of time, and inebriating
                 spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation. This conjecture is confirmed by the 
                 etymology, for the Arabic word <foreign><!-- arabic --></foreign> is evidently derived from the Hebrew <foreign><!-- hebrew --></foreign>
                 which signifies an <soCalled>intoxicating liquor</soCalled>. When <name>Indians</name> began to make the Cane-
                 juice into sugar, I cannot discover; probably, it soon found its way into <placeName>Europe</placeName>
                 in that <unclear>form</unclear>, first by the <geogName>Red-sea</geogName>, and afterwards through <placeName>Persia</placeName>, by the <geogName>Black-sea</geogName> and
                 <geogName>Caspian</geogName>; but the plant itself was not known to <placeName>Europe</placeName>, till the <name>Arabians</name> introduced
                 it into the southern parts of <placeName>Spain</placeName>, <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, and those provinces of <placeName>France</placeName> which bor­
                 
                 <!-- Insert pb info and links here -->
                 
                 der on the <geogName>Pyrenean mountains</geogName>. It was also successfully cultivated in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and in many
                 places on the <geogName>Barbary-coast</geogName>. From the <geogName>Mediterranean</geogName>, the <name>Spaniards</name> and <name>Portuguese</name>
                 transported the Cane to the <placeName><unclear>Azores</unclear></placeName>, the <placeName>Madeiras</placeName>, the <placeName>Canary</placeName> and the <placeName>Cape-Verd
                 islands</placeName>, soon after they had been discovered in the fifteenth century and in most of
                 these, particularly <placeName>Madeira</placeName>, it throve exceedingly. Weather the Cane is a native
                 of either the <placeName>Great</placeName> or <placeName>Lesser Antilles</placeName> cannot now be determined for their discoverers
                 were so wholly employed in searching after imaginary gold-mines, that they took
                 little or no notice of the natural productions. Indeed the wars, wherein they wantonly
                 engaged themselves with the natives, was another hindrance to physical investigation.
                 But whether the <ecda:flora>Cane</ecda:flora> was a production of the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName> or not, it is
                 probably the <name>Spaniards</name> and <name>Portuguese</name> did not begin to cultivate it either there or in
                 <placeName>South America</placeName> (where it certainly was found), till some years after their discovery.
                 It is also equally uncertain whether Sugar was first made in the Islands or on the Continent,
                 and whether the <name>Spaniards</name> or <name>Portuguese</name> were the first planters in the new world:
                 it is indeed most likely that the latter erected the first sugar-works in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, as they are
                 more lively and enterprizing than the <name>Spaniards</name>. However they had not long the start
                 of the latter; for in <date>1506</date> <persName>Ferdinand the Catholic</persName> ordered the Cane to be carried from
                 the <placeName>Canaries</placeName> to <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>, in which island one <persName>Pedro de Atenca</persName> soon after built an
                 <foreign>Ingenio de açucar</foreign> for so the <name>Spaniards</name> call a Sugar-work. But, though they began thus
                 early to turn their thoughts to sugar, the <name>Portuguese</name> far outstripped them in that trade;
                 for <placeName>Lisbon</placeName> soon supplied most of <placeName>Europe</placeName> with a commodity; and notwithstanding
                 the <name>English</name> then paid the <name>Portuguese</name> at the rate of <measure commodity="sugar">4l per C. wt.</measure> for muscovado, yet that
                 priece, great as it may now appear, was probably much less than what the Sugar from the
                 <placeName>East-Indies</placeName> had commonly been sold for. Indeed, so intent was the <orgName>Crown of Portugal</orgName>
                 on extending their <name><placeName>Brazil</placeName>-trade</name>, that that of the <placeName>East-Indies</placeName> began to be neglected, and
                 soon suffered a manifest decay. However, their sugar made them ample amends,
                 in which trade they continued almost without a rival for upwards of a century. At last
                 the <name>Dutch</name>, in <date>1623</date>, drove the <name>Portuguese</name> out of all the northern part of <placeName>Brazil</placeName>; and,
                 during one and twenty years they kept that conquest, those industrious republicans
                 learned the art making sugar. This probably inspired the <name>English</name> with a desire
                 
                 <!-- Insert page and link information here -->
                 
                 of coming in for a share of the sugar-trade; accordingly they, renouncing their chimerical
                 search after gold mines in <placeName>Florida</placeName> and <placeName>Guiana</placeName>, settled themselves soon after the
                 mouth of the <geogName>river Surinam</geogName>, where they cultivated the Cane with such success, that when
                 the colony was ceded to the <name>Dutch</name> by the <name>treaty of <placeName>Breda</placeName></name>, it maintained not less than
                 40,000 <name>Whites</name>, half of that number of slaves, as employed one year with another 15,000
                 ton of shipping. This cession was a severe blow to the <name><rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>-trade</name>, which did not
                 recover for several years, though many of the <rs type="properAdjective">Surinam</rs> Planters carried their art and <name>Negroes</name>
                 to the <placeName>Leeward Islands</placeName> and <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, which then began to be the object of political
                 consideration in <placeName>England</placeName>.

                 Sugar is twice mentioned by <persName ref="geoffrey_chaucer_1343">Chaucer</persName>, who flourished in the fourteenth century;
                 and succeeding poets, down to the middle of the last, use the epithet <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">Sugar'd</soCalled>, whenever
                 they woud express any thing uncommonly pleasing: since that time, the
                 more elegant writers seldom admit of that adjective in a metaphorical sense; but
                 herein perhaps they are affectedly squeamish.

                 The red requires a better mould, and always emits a disagreeable smell before rain.
                 The wood of both are highly useful for many mechanical purposes, and but too little

                 in <persName>Shakespear's</persName> words, may justly be stiled
                 <quote rend="block">A precious stone set in the silver sea,</quote>
                 lies in the seventeenth degree <choice><abbr>N. L.</abbr><expan><foreign>Nomen loci<!-- ?? --></foreign></expan></choice>. It was discovered by the great <persName ref="#christopher_columbus_1450">Christopher Columbus</persName>,
                 in his second voyage, <date>1493</date>, who was so pleased with his appearance, that he honoured
                 it with his <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> name. Though others pretend, that appellation was given it from
                 an imaginary resemblance between a high mountain in its centre, now called <geogName>Mount Misery</geogName>
                 to the fabulous legend of the Devil's carrying <!--<persName>St. Christopher</persName>--> on his shoulders.
                 But, be this as it will, the <name>Spaniards</name> soon after settled it, and lived in tolerable harmony
                 with the natives for many years; and as their fleets commonly called in there to
                 and from <placeName>America</placeName> for provision and water, the settlers, no doubt, reaped some
                 advantage from their situation. By <!-- Templeman's Survey -->, it contains eighty square miles,
                 and is about seventy miles in circumference. It is of an irregular oblong figure, and
                 has a chain of mountains, that run South and North almost from the one end of it to 
                 the other, formerly covered with wood, but now the Cane plantations reach almost to
                 their summits, and extend all the way, down their easy declining sides, tothe sea, From
                 these mountains some rivers take their rise, which never dry up; and there are many
                 others which, after rain, run into the sea, but which, at other times, are lost before
                 they reach it. Hence, as this land consists of mountain-land and valley, it must always
                 make a midling crop; for when the low grounds fail, the uplands supply that deficiency;
                 and, when the mountain canes are lodged (or become watery from too much
                 rain) those in the plains yield surprisingly. Nor are the plantations here only seasonable,
                 their Sugar sells for mor than the Sugar of any other of his Majesty's islands; as

                 their produce cannot be refined to the best advantage without a mixture of <placeName>St. Kitts'</placeName>
                 muscovado. In the barren part of the island, which runs out towards <placeName>Nevis</placeName>, are several
                 ponds, which in dry weather crystallize into good salt; and below <geogName>Mount Misery</geogName> is
                 a small Solfaterre, and collection of fresh water, where fugitive <name>Negroes</name> often take
                 shelter, and escape their pursuers. Not far below is a large plain which affords good
                 pasture, water, and wood; and, if the apporaches thereto were fortified, which might
                 be done at a moderate expence, it would be rendered inaccessible. The <name>English</name>,
                 repulsing the few natives and <name>Spaniards</name>, who opposed them, began to plant tobacco
                 here A.D. 1623. Two years after, the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>-settlers received a considerable reinforcement from their
                 mother-country; and, the chiefs of both nations, being men of sound policy, entered 
                 into an agreement to divide the island between them: the <name>French</name> retaining
                 both extremities, and the <name>English</name> possessing themselves of the middle parts of the island.
                 Some time after both nations erected sugar-works, but there were more tobacco, indigo,
                 coffee, and cotton-plantations, than Sugar ones, as these require a much greater fund to
                 carry them on, than those other. All the planters, however, lived easy in their circumstances;
                 for, though the <name>Spaniards</name>, who could not bear to be spectators of their thriving
                 condition, did repossess themselves of the island, yet they were soon obliged to
                 retire, and the colony succeeded better than ever. One reason for this, was that it had
                 been agreed between the two nations, that they should here remain neutral whatever
                 wars their mother-counties might wage against each other in Europe. This was
                 a wise regulation for an instant settlement; but, when <persName>King James</persName> abdicated the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs>
                 throne, the <name>French</name> suddenly rose, and drove out the unprepared <name>English</name> by
                 force of arms. The <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> colonists of <placeName>St. Christopher</placeName> had soon reason, however to
                 repent their impolitic breach of faith; for the expelled planters, being assisted by their
                 countrymen from the neighbouring isles, and supported by a formidable fleet, soon recovered,
                 not only their lost plantations, but obliged the french totally to abandon
                 the island. Ager the <name>treaty of <placeName>Ryswick</placeName></name>, indeedm some few of those among them, who
                 had not obtained settlements in <placeName>Martinico</placeName> and <placeName>Hispaniola</placeName>, returned to <placeName>St.
                 Chrisopher</placeName>: but the war of the partition soon after breaking out, they were finally expelled,
                 and the whole island was ceded in Sovereignty to the crown of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, by the
                 <name>treaty of <placeName>Utrecht</placeName></name>. Since that time, <placeName>St. Christopher</placeName> has gradually improved, and it
                 is now at the height of perfection. The Indian name of <placeName>St. Christopher</placeName> is <soCalled><foreign>Liamuiga</foreign></soCalled>,
                 or the Fertile Island.

                 This century will always make a distinguished figure in the history of the human

                 The island of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> was bestowed on <persName ref="#christopher_columbus_1450">Columbus</persName>, as some compensation
                 for his discovery of the new world; accordingly his son <!-- <persName>James</persName> --> settled, and planted it,
                 early [A.D. <date>1509</date>] the following century. What improvements  the <name>Spaniards</name> made
                 therein is no where mentioned; but, had their industry been equal to their opportunities, 
                 their improvements whould have been considerable; for they continued in the
                 undisturbed possession of it till the year 1596, when <persName>Sir Anthony Shirley</persName>, with a
                 single man of war, took and plundered <placeName>St. Jago de la Vega</placeName>, which then consisted of
                 2000 houses. In the year 1635, <placeName>St. Jago de la Vega</placeName> was a second timed plundered
                 by 500 <name>English</name> from the <placeName>Leeward islands</placeName>, tho' that capital, and the fort (which they
                 also took) were defended by four times their number of <name>Spaniards</name>. One and twenty
                 years afterwards, the whole island was reduced by the forces sent thither by <persName ref="#oliver_cromwell_1599">Oliver
                 Cromwell</persName>, and has ever since belonged to <placeName>England</placeName>. It is by far the largest island

                 that island, for he instructed the young <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> settlers to cultivate the Sugar-cane; for
                 which, and other great improvements which he then made them acquainted with,
                 <persName>King Charles</persName>, three years afterwards, appointed him Governour thereof, in which

                 in their voyages to and from <placeName>South-America</placeName>, and the Islands; accordingly we are told,
                 when the <name>English</name> first landed there, which was about the end of the sixteenth or beginning
                 of the seventeenth century, they found in it an excellent breed of wild hogs,
                 but no inhabitants. In the year <date>1627</date>, <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>, with most of the other <placeName>Caribbee-
                 Islands</placeName>, were granted by <persName>Charles I</persName>. to the Earl of Carlisle, that nobleman agreeing to
                 pay to the <persName>Earl of Marlborough</persName>, and his hears, a perpetual annuity of 300 l. per annum,
                 for his waving his claim to <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>, which he had obtained, by patent, in the
                 preceding reign. The adventurers to whom that nobleman parcelled out this island, at
                 first cultivated tobacco; but, that not turning out to their advantage, they applied,
                 with better success, to cotton, indigo, and ginger. At last, some cavaliers of good
                 fortune transporting themselves thither, and introducing the Sugar-cane [A. D. 1647]
                 probably from <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, in ten years time the island was peopled with upwards of
                 30,000 <name>Whites</name>, and twice that number of <name>Negroes</name>, and sent yearly very considerable
                 quantities of sugar to the mother-country. At the Restoration, <persName>King Charles II.</persName>
                 bought off the claim of the <name>Carlisle</name>-family; and, in the consideration of its then
                 becoming a royal instead of a proprietary government, the planters gave the <orgName>Crown</orgName>
                 4 ½ per cent. on their sugars; which duty still continues, although the island is said to 
                 be less able to pay it now than it was a hundred years ago. It is upwards of 20 miles
                 long, and in some places almost 14 broad.

                 softer, and consequently having more gems, from whence the young sprouts shoot, is
                 properer for planting than any other part of it. From one to four junks, each about 
                 a foot long, are put in every hole. Where too many junks are planted in one hole,
                 the Canes may be numerous, but can neither become vigorous, nor yield such a
                 quantity of rich liquor as they otherwise would. In case the young shoots do not
                 appear above ground in four or five weeks, the deficiencies must be supplied with new 
                 tops.

                 are very troublesome, especially to strangers, whom they bite unmercifully, causing
                 a yellow coloured tumour, attended with excessive itching. Ugly ulcers have often
                 been occasioned by scratching those swellings, in persons of a bad habit of body.
                 Though natives of the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, they are not less common in the coldest
                 regions; for <persName>Mr. Maupertuis</persName> takes notice how troublesome they were to him and his
                 attendents on the snowy summit of certain mountains within the arctic circle. They,
                 however, chiefly love shady, moist, and warm places. Accordingly they are commonest
                 to be met with in the corners of rooms, towards evening, and before rain. They are
                 so light, as not to be felt when they pitch on the skin; and, as soon as they have darted
                 in their proboscis, fly off, so that the first intimation one has being bit by them, is
                 the itching tumour. Warm lime-juice is its remedy. The Mosquito makes a
                 humming noise, especially in the night time.

                 All of them are perfectly innocent. The <name>Caribbeans</name> used to eat them; they are
                 not inferiour to snakes as a medicated food. Snuff forced into their mouth soon
                 convulses them. They change colour, and become torpid; but, in a few hours,
                 recover. The guana, or rather Iguana, is the largest sort of lizard. This, when 
                 irritated, will fly at one. It lives mostly upon fruit. It has a saw-like appearance,
                 which ranges from its head all along its back, to its tail. The flesh of it is esteemed
                 a great delicacy. The first writers on the <soCalled>Lues Venerea</soCalled>, forbid its use, to those who
                 labour under that disease. It is a very ugly animal. In some parts of South-

                 It is generally divided into three kinds, the common, the <!-- French, and the Spanish -->,
                 which differ from each other in their leaves and flowers, if not in their fruit or

                 it has no resemblance to any of the former, in leaves, flowers, or seeds. In one particular
                 they all agree <abbr>viz.</abbr> in their yielding to coction or expression a purgative or emetic
                 oil. The <name>Spaniards</name> name these nuts <soCalled><foreign>Avellanas purgativas</foreign></soCalled>; hence Ray terms them
                 <soCalled><foreign>Avellanæ purgatrices novi orbis</foreign></soCalled>. By roasting they are supposed to lose part of their virulency,
                 which is wholly destroyed, say some people, by taking out a leaf-like substance
                 that is to be found between the lobes. The nut exceeds a walnut, or even an
                 almond, in sweetness, and yet three or four of them will operate briskly both up and

                 meal makes a wholesome and well-tasted bread, although its juice be poisonous.
                 There is a species of cassada which may be eat with safety, without expressing the
                 juice; this the <name>French</name> call Camagnoc. The colour of its root is white, like a
                 parsnip; that of the common kind is of a brownish red, before it is scraped. By 
                 coction the cassada-juice becomes an excellent sauce for fish; and the <name>Indians</name> prepare
                 many wholesom dishes from it. I have given it internally mixed with flour 
                 without any bad consequences; it did not however produce any of the salutary effects
                 I expected. A good starch is made from it. The stem is knotty, and,
                 being cut into small junks and planted, young sprouts shoot up from each knob.
                 Horses have been poisoned by eating its leaves. The <name>French</name> name it <soCalled><foreign>Manihot</foreign></soCalled>,
                 <soCalled><foreign>Magnoc</foreign></soCalled>, and <soCalled><foreign>Manioc</foreign></soCalled>, and the <name>Spaniards</name> <soCalled><foreign>Mandiocha</foreign></soCalled>.
                 It is pretended that all creatures
                 but man eat the raw root of the cassada with impunity; and, when dried, that it
                 is a sovereign antidote against venomous bites. A wholesome drink is prepared from
                 this root by the <name>Indians</name>, <name>Spaniards</name>, and <name>Poruguese</name>, according to <persName>Pineda</persName>. There is
                 one species of this plant which the <name>Indians</name> only use, and is by them called <soCalled>Baccacoua</soCalled>.

                 in the barrenest places to a considerable height. Its fruit will often weigh two pounds.
                 Its skin is green, and somewhat prickly. The pulp is not disagreeable to the
                 palate, being cool, and having its sweetness tempered with some degree of an
                 acid. It is one of the <!-- Anonas?? -->, as are also the custard, star, and sugar-apples. The
                 leaves of the soursop are very shining and green. The fruit is wholesome, but seldom
                 admitted to the tables of the elegant. The seeds are dispersed through the pulp
                 like the guava. It has a peculiar flavour. It grows in the East as well as the <placeName>West-

                 Authors mention four species of cotton, but they now confound the silk-cotton tree,
                 or <soCalled>Ceiba</soCalled>, among them. The flower of the <rs type="properAdjective">West-India</rs> cotton-shrub is yellow, and
                 campanulated. It produces twice every year. That of Cayenne is the best of any

                 the <name>Indians</name> before the <name>Spaniards</name> came upon them, who were some time in those
                 countries ere they could be prevailed upon to taste it; and it must be confessed.
                 that the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> chocolate had not a tempting aspect; yet I doubt whether the
                 <name>Europeans</name> have greatly improved its wholesomeness, by the addition of vanellas and
                 other hot ingredients. The tree often grows fifteen or twenty feet high, and is
                 streight and handsome. The pods which seldom contain less than thirty nuts of
                 the size of a flatted olive, grow upon the stem and principal branches. The tree
                 loves a moist, rich, and shaded soil: Hence those who plant cacao-walks, sometimes
                 screen them by a hardier tree, which the <name>Spaniards</name> aptly term <soCalled><foreign>Madre de Cacao</foreign></soCalled>.
                 They may be planted fifteen or twenty feet distant, though some advise to plant
                 them much nearer, and perhaps wisely; for it is an easy matter to thin them, when
                 they are past the danger of being destroyed by dry weather, &amp;c. Some recommend
                 planting cassada, or bananas, in the intervals, when the cacao-trees are young,
                 to destroy weeds, from which the walk cannot be kept too free. It is generally
                 three years before they produce good pods; but in six years, they are in highest
                 perfection. The pods are commonly of the size and shape of a large cucumber.
                 There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour 
                 and goodness of their nuts. That from the Caraccas is certainly the best. None
                 of the species grow in <placeName>Peru</placeName>. Its alimentary, as well as physical properties, are

                 water is distilled. It produces fruit twice every year; but the shrub must be three
                 years old before any can be gathered. It should not be allowed to grow above six
                 foot high. It is very apt to be destroyed by a large fly, which the <name>French</name> call <soCalled><foreign>Mouche

                 of <persName>Mithridates king of <placeName>Pontus</placeName></persName>; who, by using it constantly, had secured himself
                 from the effects of poison, in such a manner, that, when he actually attempted to 
                 put an end to his life, by that means, he failed in his purpose. So, at least, <persName>Pliny</persName>
                 informs us. But we happily are not obliged to believe, implicitly, whatever that elaborate
                 compiler has told us. When poisons immediately operate on the nervous
                 system, and their effects are to be expelled by the skin, this electuary is no contemptible
                 antidote. But how many poisons do we know at present, which produce their 
                 effects in a different manner? and, from the <sic>acounts</sic> of authors, we have reason to
                 be persuaded, that the antients were not much behind us in their variety of poisons.
                 If, therefore, the King of Pontus had really intended to have destroyed himself, he 
                 could have been at no loss for the means, notwithstanding the daily use of this antidote.

                 <label>Ver. 438.</label> <hi>the bending coco's]</hi> The coco-nut tree is of the palm genus; there are
                 several species of them, which grow naturally in the Torrid Zone. The coco-nut tree
                 is, by no means, so useful as travellers have represented it. The wood is of little
                 or no service, being spungy, and the brown covering of the nuts is of too rough a
                 texture to serve as apparel. The shell of the nut receives a good polishl and having
                 a hantle to put to it, is commonly used to drink water out of. The milk or water 
                 of the nut, is cooling and pleasant; but, if drunk too freely, will frequently occasion
                 a pain in the stomach. A salutary oil may be extracted from the kernel; which, if
                 old, and eaten too plentifully, is apt to produce a shortness of breathing. A species
                 of arrack is made from this tree, in the <placeName>East-Indies</placeName>. The largest coco-nut trees grow
                 on the banks of the <geogName>river Oronoko</geogName>. They thrive best near the sea, and look beautiful
                 at a distance. They afford no great shide. Ripe nuts have been produced from
                 them in three years after planting. The nuts should be macerated in water, before
                 they are put in the ground. <distinct type="dialect">Coco</distinct> is an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> name; the <name>Spaniards</name> call it also
                 <distinct type="dialect">palma de las Indias</distinct>; as the smallest kind, whose nuts are less than walnuts, is termed
                 by them <distinct type="dialect">Coquillo</distinct>. This grows in <placeName>Chili</placeName>, and the nuts are esteemed more delicate
                 than those of a larger size. In the <placeName>Maldivy-Islands</placeName>, it is pretended. they not only
                 build houses of the coco-nut tree, but also vessels, with all their rigging; nay, and
                 load them too with wine, oil, vinegar, black sugar, fruit, and strong water, from
                 the same tree. If this be true, the <rs type="properAdjective">Maldivian</rs> coco-nut trees must differ widely from
                 those that grow in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>. The coco must not be confounded with the
                 coco-nut tree. That shrub grows in the hottest and postest vales of the Andes. Its
                 leaf, which is gather two or three times a year, is much coveted by the natives of 
                 <placeName>South-America</placeName>, who will travel reat journeys upon a single handful of the leaves,
                 which they do not swallow, but only chew. It is of an unpleasant taste, but, by use,
                 soon grows agreeable. Some authors have also confounded the coco-nit palm, with
                 the coco, or chocolate tree. The <name>French</name> call the coco-nut tree, <distinct xml:lang="fr" type="dialect">Cocotier,</distinct>. Its
                 stem, which is very lofty, is always bent; for which reason it looks better in an
                 orchard than in a regular garden. As one limb fades, another shoots up in the center,
                 like a pike. The botanical name is <distinct type="scientific">Palma indica, coccifera, angulosa</distinct>.

           <p>Soon after my arrival in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, I conceived the de-
              sign of writing a poem on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane.
              My inducements to this arduous undertaking were, not only the 
              importance and novelty of the subject, but more especially this consideration; 
              that, as the face of the country was wholly different
              from that of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, so whatever hand copied its appearances,
              however rude, could not fail to enrich poetry with many new and
              picturesque images.
           </p>
           <p>I cannot, indeed, say I have satisfied my own ideas in
              this particular: yet I must be permitted to recommend the precepts
              contained in this Poem. They are the children of Truth, not of 
              Genius; the result of Experience, not the productions of Fancy.
              Thus, though I may not be able to please, I shall stand some
              chance of instructing the Reader; which, as it is the nobler end of
              all poetry, so should it be the principal aim of every writer who
              wishes to be thought a good man.
           </p>
           <p>It must, however, be observed, that, though the general precepts 
              are suited to every climate where Cane will grow; yet,
              the more minute rules are chiefly drawn from the practice of St.
              Christopher. Some selection was necessary; and I could adopt no
              
              
              
              modes of planting, with such propriety, as those I had seen practised 
              in that island, where it was been my good fortune chiefly to
              reside since I came to the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>.
           </p>
           <p>I have often been astonished, that so little has been published
              on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane, while the press has groaned
              under folios on every other branch of rural <sic>oeconomy</sic>. It were
              unjust to suppose planters were not solicitous for the improvement
              of their art, and injurious to assert they were incapable of obliging
              mankind with their improvements.
           </p>
           <p>And yet except some scattered hints in <persName ref="#jeanbaptiste_labat_1663">Pere Labat</persName>, and other
              <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> travellers in <placeName>America</placeName>; an Essay by <persName ref="samuel_martin_1694">Colonel Martyn</persName> of <placeName>Antigua</placeName>, 
              is the only piece on plantership I have seen deserving a perusal. 
              That gentleman's pamphlet is, indeed, an excellent performance; 
              and to it I own myself indebted.
           </p>
           <p>It must be confessed, that terms of art look awkward in poetry;
              yet didactic compositions cannot wholly dispense with them. Accordingly 
              we find that <persName ref="hesiod_0001">Hesiod</persName> and <persName ref="#virgil_0070">Virgil</persName>, among the ancients with
              <persName ref="#john_philips_1676">Philips</persName> and <persName ref="#john_dyer_1699">Dyer</persName>, (not to mention some other poets now living in
              our own country); have been obliged to insert them in their poems.
              Their example is a sufficient apology for me, for in their steps I
              shall always be proud to tread.
           </p>
           
           <lg type="poem" xml:lang="la">
              <l>Vos sequor ô Gracaiæ gentis decus inque vestris nunc</l>
              <l>Fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis;</l>
              <l>Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amoreum</l>
              <l>Quod imitari aveo.—</l>
           </lg>
           <p>Yet, like them too, I have generally preferred the way of description, 
              wherever that could be done without hurting the subject.
           </p>
           <p>Such words as are not common in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, I have briefly ex­
              plained: because an obscure poem affords both less pleasure and 
              profit to the reader.—For the same reason, some notes have been
              added, which, it is presumed will not be disagreeable to those
              who have never been in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>.
           </p>
           <p>In a <rs type="properAdjective">West-India</rs> georgic, the mention of many indigenous
              remedies, as well as diseases, was unavoidable. The truth is,
              I have rather courted opportunities of this nature, than avoided
              them. Medicines of such amazing efficacy, as I have had occasion
              to make trials of in these islands, deserve to be universally known.
              And wherever, in the following poem, I recommend any such, I
              beg leave to be understood as a physician, and not a poet

                  <l>The planets thus withdraw their puny fires.</l>

                  <l>Care meliorates their growth. The trenches fill</l>
                  <l>With their collateral mold; as in a town</l>
                  <l>Which foes have long beleaguer'd, unawares</l>
                  <l>A strong detachment sallies from each gate,</l>
                  <l>And levels all the labours of the plain.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And now thy Cane's first blades their verdure lose,</l>
                  <l>And hang their idle heads. Be these stript off;</l>
                  <l>So shall fresh sportive airs their joints embrace,</l>
                  <l>And by their alliance give the sap to rise.</l>
                  <l>But, O beware, let no unskilful hand</l>
                  <l>The vivid foliage tear: Their channel'd spouts,</l>
                  <l>Well-pleas'd, the watery nutriment convey,</l>
                  <l>With filial duty, to the thirsty stem;</l>
                  <l>And, spreading wide their reverential arms,</l>
                  <l>Defend their parent from solstitial skies.</l>

                    <l>Oft Junio cried, ah! when shall we see land?</l>
                    <l>Soon land they made: and now in thought he claspt</l>
                    <l>His Indian bride, and deem'd his toils o'er paid.</l>

                    <l>Intent her Junio's vessel to descry.</l>

                    <l>The winged dæmons of the temptest rose;</l>
                    <l>Thunder, and rain, and lightning's awful power.</l>
                    <l>She fled: could innocence, could beauty claim</l>
                    <l>Exemption from the grave; the ætherial Bolt,</l>
                    <l>That stretched her speechless, o'er her lovely head</l>
                    <l>Had innocently roll'd.</l>

                    <l>Ah youth! what woes, too great for man to bear,</l>
                    <l>Are ready to burst on thee? Urge not so</l>
                    <l>Thy flying courser. Soon Theana's porch</l>

                    <l>All pale and cold, in every feature death,</l>
                    <l>Theana lay; and yet a glimpse of joy</l>
                    <l>Played on her face, while with faint, faultering voice,</l>
                    <l>She thus addrest the youth, whom yet she knew.</l>

                    <l>But say, what strangs, what language can express</l>
                    <l>The thousand pangs, which tore the lover's breast?</l>
                    <l>Upon her breathless corse himself he threw,</l>
                    <l>And to her clay-cold lips, with trembling haste,</l>

                    <l>Ten thousand kisses gave. He strove to speak;</l>
                    <l>Nor words he found: he clasp her in his arms;</l>
                    <l>He sigh'd, he swoon'd, he look'd up, and died away.</l>

                 <lg>
                    <l>One grave contains this hapless, faithful pair;</l>
