                  BOWEN</persName>.</head>
            <p>THE late <persName>Capt. Bowen</persName>, of his Majesty's ship
               <!-- shipName -->Terpsichore, who was killed in the attack of the town of
                  <placeName>Santa Cruz</placeName>, in the island of
                  <placeName>Teneriffe</placeName>, in Juy last, was born at
                  <placeName>Ilfracrombe</placeName>, in the <placeName>county of Devon</placeName>,
               in 1761, and has left a worthy, aged father, three brothers, and two sisters, to
               lament the loss of this invaluable ornament to his family. His eldest brother
                  <persName>Capt. James Bowen</persName>, was a master in the navy, and served in
               the last war, chiefly with <persName>Admiral McBride</persName>: in the peace he was
               naval agent at <placeName>Deptford</placeName>; and, at the commencement of this war,
               was appointed master of the <!-- shipName -->Queen Charlotte, in the
               <!-- militaryUnit -->Channel Fleet; and for his meritorious services on the glorious
               first of June, with the noble <persName>Early Howe</persName>, and for his
               distinguished conduct as first lieutenant of the <!-- shipName -->Queen Charlotte, on
               the <date>23d of June, 1795</date>, with the late gallant <persName>Sir Andrew Snape
                  Douglas</persName>, under the command of <persName>Lord Bridport</persName>, he
               was promoted to the rank of commander, and, shortly after, to that of post captain,
               and commandeded the <!-- shipName -->Thunderer (never the Canada), under admiral
                  <persName>Sir H.C. Christain</persName>, at the <!-- militaryEvent -->reduction of
               St. Lucia. His youngest brother, fell a victim fo the West-India climate, on board
               his Majesty's ship <!-- shipName -->Cumberland, in the <!-- militaryUnit -->Spanish
               Armament in 1790.</p>
            <p><persName>Capt. Richard Bowen</persName> was placed a midshipman in the navy early in
               life, by his eldest brother; was soon after taken into a fireship, and patronized by
                  <persName>Captain (now Sir Robert) Calder</persName>, who recommended him to
                  <persName>Captain Jervis (now Earl of St. Vincent)</persName> of the
               <!-- shipName -->Foudroyant, where he soon attracted the notice of that great
               officer, who appointed him his aid-du-camp in time of action. His prompt obedience
               and active service in the capture of <!-- shipName --><shipName
                     xmlns="http://dsg.northeastern.edu/ecda/ns/1.0"><foreign
                        xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:lang="fr">Le
                  Pegase</foreign></shipName> merited the approbation and esteem of his Captain; in testimony
               of which<pb n="004"/> her presented him with a sword, and immediately made him an
               acting lieutenant in his own ship, where he continued to the end of the war; at which
               period, not having served the six years required according to the regulations of the
               navy, his commission could not be confirmed; to accomplish which, his patron sent him
               to the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>; where he served the greatest part of a
               three years station as acting-lieutenant. There being no regular vacancy, he was not
               confirmed; but, bent to perseere in his favourite profession, he went a second time
               to the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, and was once more appointed
               acting-lieutenant by <persName>Commodore Parker</persName>; and ater serving a
               considerable time, and being disappointed in his confirmation, he rturned. However,
               this discouragement did not damp his ardour for the service, and he again embarked
               with his friend <persName>Sir Robert Calder</persName>.</p>
            <p>When the Spanish Armament commenced, his patron <persName>Sir John Jervis</persName>,
               took him in the <!-- shipName -->Prince, as his flag lieutenant, and he soon obtained
               his confirmation to that rank, being included in the list of the first 20 that were
               promoted by the Admiralty, in consequence of former services.</p>
            <p>In 1791, he was appointed by the Navy-board to command a large division of
               transports, destined to relieve the <placeName>Colony of New South-Wales</placeName>,
               where he arrived in time to afford it great relief. The
               <persName>Governor</persName>, deeming him a proper person to procure a farther
               supply, dispatched him, in the Atlantic, to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, for a
               cargo of <!-- commodity --><commodity xmlns="http://dsg.northeastern.edu/ecda/ns/1.0">rice</commodity>, which voyage he performed in a short time, to the
               great joy and comfort of the Colonists and very much to the satisfaction of
                  <orgName>Government</orgName>, as well as to the <orgName>Council at
                  Bengal</orgName>, who, in their dispatches home, considered his great attention to
               the service he was entrusted with as meriting their notice.</p>
            <p>On his return to <placeName>England</placeName> with <persName>Gov.
                  Phillips</persName>, he found the present was had commenced, and his patron,
                  <persName>Sir John Jervis</persName>, about to be employed on an expedition to the
                  <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>, with whom he embarked as 4th lieutenant of the
               Boyne, where he soon had an opportunity of distinguishing himself, being appointed,
               at the siege of <placeName>Martinique</placeName>, commanding office of the guard,
               and gun-boats, and actually took the guard 19 successive nights, exposed to the heavy
               rains and dews of that climate, without ever laying down on a bed.</p>
            <p>During this active siege, the commander in chief had information that it was the
               enemy's intention to destroy all the English prisoners, if the English Admiral should
               attempt to storm the fort; and that the French general had placed them on board the
               Bien-Venu French frigate which was moored close to the walls of Fort-Royal for that
               diabolical purpose. To rescue his countrymen from this <pb n="4"/> perilous
               situation, he received a discretionary order from Sir John Jervis to act in such a
               manner as he might think would prove successful. He was not long determining on the
               performance of this service; for, the very next day at noon, in the face of the whole
               garrison, and to the astonishment and admiration of the British fleet, this intrepid
               officer, in the head of his barge, supported by his guard-boats, went through a heavy
               fire of musquetry from the fort, which was not fifty yards from the ship, boarded the
               frigate, and driving the greatest part of the French <choice>
                  <sic>craw</sic>
                  <corr>crew</corr>
               </choice> over-board, obtained possessin of her. The ship being moored with chains,
               and the wind unfavourable for bringing her off, after searching the hold and not
               finding any English prisoners, he turned the frigate's guns against the fort, and
               came off with the captain and about 20 French prisoners, under cover of the smoke,
               with the loss of very few killed and wounded.</p>
            <p>The success of this gallant action determined the commander in chief to commence the
               attack of Fort-Royal. In the capture of which, it was this enterprizing young man's
               good fortune to be close at the heels of the fallant Faulkner, who commanded the
               Zebra, amp&amp; boarded the fort, under a press of sail which outstripped them all.
               The same day the Bien-Venu was commissioned, and in compliment to the brave Faulkner,
               who was appointed to command her, she was named the Undaunter, and Lieutenant Richard
               Bowen appointed to the command of the Zebra, in which he was actively employed in the
               reduction of Guadeloupe, and the rest of the islands, when he was promoted to the
               command of his Majesty's ship Veteran, and, shortly after, to his Majesty's ship
               Terpsichore, in which ship he was sent to America, where hearing that his Majesty's
               ship Dædalus was blocked up in the Chesapeak by two French ships of superior force,
               he boldly went and relieved her. Upon his return to Guadaloupe, he found part of the
               island int he possession of the enemy; he was then stationed to guard the coast, and
               to succour and protect the supplies brought to fort Matilda, which, at this time, the
               enemy had closely besieged. His vigilance, seal, and exertions, on this service, were
               the admiration of the genearl and the whole garrison; and, when it was deemed proper
               to evacuate the fort, to his superior skill and judgment the admiraal and general
               fave the credite of saving the whole garrison; for, by his judicious arrangements,
               not a man was lost, and only himself wounded by a musquet ball in the cheek. The
               letters on this occasion, from the admiral and general, bear ample tertimony of his
               uncommon abilities.</p>
            <p>The wound that he received was os such dangrous tendency, that the admiral thought it
               necessary to send him home with the general and his dispatches, where he was actively
               employed in con<pb n="5"/><fw type="pagenum">6</fw>voying the trade, until his patron
               was appointed to the command of the Mediterranean fleet. He was then ordered to guard
               the Streights of Gibraltar, and to communicate with that garrison. This post of
               honour soon gave him another opportunity of distinguishing himself, by bringing to
               action and capturing La Mahonesa Spanish frigate, mugh larger, and superior in every
               point of force, that then Terpsichore. Shortly after his damages were repaired, he
               fell in with La Vestale French frigate, of superior force, and, after a severe action
               of several hours, upon a lee-shore, and an enemy's coart, cpature her; but her masts
               being shot away, he was obliged to bring both ships to anchor. After repairing his
               own damages, he took his prize in tow; but, unfortunately, the ropes got entangles in
               the rocks, and she was under the necessity of cutting her adrift, and with much
               difficulty cleared the coast with his own ship. The prisoners, taking advantage of
               the night, rose upon the officers and few men who were on board the prize, took
               possession, and, with the assistance of Spanish launches, which came from the shore,
               by the next morning, before he could get within gun-shot of her, she was towing into
               Cadiz. In this gallant action his brother, George, who was his first lieutenant, was
               wounded by a ball passing through his shoulders, which rendered his arm useless, for
               which he has been promoted to the rank of commander, and rewarded by a pension. </p>
            <p>After the glorious action off Cape St. Vincent, he fell in with the Santis ema
               Trinidada alone. Expecting every moment to meet with some of our cruizers, he brought
               her to action, and annoyed her considerably, withouth receiving any damage himself;
               after teazing her two days, he was obliged to quit her, on the approach of some
               Spanish men of war.</p>
            <p>His taking possession, and bringing off, a large Spanish merchantman, close to the
               mouth of Cadiz, in the presence of a line-of-battle ship, who was in chace of him;
               his cutting out a ship from under the gunds of Teneriffe in April 1797, and numerous
               other enterprizes, executed with skill and judgment, brought him to act with
               Rear-Admiral Nelson, at the bombardment of Cadiz, and to the fatal enterprize at
               Teneriffe, where, at the head of his own ship's company, who had been his faithful
               companions during the war, he gallantly exectued the part the admiral had assigned to
               him; and after having taken possession of the mole, he unfortunately, though nobly,
               fell; and there terminated the glorious career of one of the bravest officers his
               country ever had to boast of, and after 20 years of actual service. With personal
               courage inferior to none, he possessed great professional knowledge, with a feeling
               mind and sound judgment to guide him.</p>
