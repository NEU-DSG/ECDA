            <p>Much time has elapsed since the cultivation

               and <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> in almost general use. Yet no per-
               son hitherto has connected any regular series
               of facts on the subject; a subject of the first 
               importance in commerce: and, more than 
               that, a subject now influencing the dispositions
               to health or disease, of the greater part of the
               inhabitants of the earth.

               against the fore-mentioned steep cliff; so that
               the cloud, having no vent but by the gutter,
               gradually ascends it, and from thence advances
               slowly to the extremity of the valley, where

               branches of the tree, from whence it distils in 
               drops during the remainder of the day, until
               it is at length exhausted, in the same manner

               minate history of the <ecda:commodity>sugar cane</ecda:commodity>.
            </p>
            <p>On the discovery of the Western hemipshere,
               the <ecda:commodity>Sugar Cane</ecda:commodity> was found on the continent;
               and also in some of the Atlantic islands; but
               the art of making <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, it is said, never was 
               practiced by the <name>aborigines</name> of the <placeName>West Indian
               islands</placeName>, until they were settled by <name>Euro-
               peans</name>; nor by the <name>Mexicans</name>, or <name>Peruvians</name>, or

            <p>The <ecda:commodity>sugar cane</ecda:commodity> is supposed to have been

               out is boiled in three several cauldrons, one
               after another. In the third cauldron it be-
               comes thick and black, and is then put into
               conical pots, which at the bottom have a lit-
               tle hole stopped only with coarse and foul
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>. These pots are covered when full

               drunk up by the lute, or run out by the hole
               in the vertex. The juice is boiled again, so
               long as it is good for any thing; but at last it
               makes only a foul <ecda:commodity>red sugar</ecda:commodity>, that will never
               be better. The conical loaves of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, after
               they are taken out, are set to drain over the
               same pots for 14 or 15 days. To make the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               more white, they must boil it again, but about
               one-sixth is lost every time. A pound of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>

               and is put out of one cauldron into another.
               They take it out of the first and second caul-

               cauldron for refining. When it is refined, it

               succeeded by any intercourse with the island,
               and seems to have been forgotten as no notice

               burnt the woods, and made a settlement; and,

            <p>From the incorrect accounts of the first
               <rs type="properAdjective">West Indian</rs> discoveries, it is impossible to
               ascertain in which of the islands the cane was
               found, an in which it was not. We know it
               was seen in some of them: but, from modern
               navigators, we have proofs that it grows
               spontaneously in all the islands in the <placeName>South Sea</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>It was found in great abundance in all the 
               <placeName>Society islands</placeName>, <placeName>Easter island</placeName>, and the
               <placeName>Sandwich isles</placeName>; where the <rs type="persGroup">Indians</rs> are perfectly

            <p>Some plants of these canes have lately been
               introduced into the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and the
               astonishing increase of sugar, which those brought
               from <placeName>Otaheite</placeName> and planted in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> yield
               over those of the island, shews, if there be not

            <p>The progress of cultivating the cane for the
               purposes of making sugar, has given rise to the 
               erroneous supposition, that the migration of
               the sugar cane, under the <name>Europeans</name>, was
               from <placeName>Sicily</placeName> and <placeName>Spain</placeName>, to the <placeName>Madeira</placeName> and
               <placeName>Canary islands</placeName>; and afterwards to the <placeName>West

            <p>There is, besides, great difficulty in distinguishing,
               in the journals of voyagers, between
               the history of the plant and its produce. For,
               often when some particular period is mentioned,
               when the sugar cane was first carried to
               countries, the fact is, that such period was the
               time when the cultivation of the plant, for
               the purposes of making sugar, was introduced;
               which before was either entirely neglected, or
               the use of simple juice only known: and
               frequently mention is made when sugar was
               first produced in some countries, which in
               reality was the period when the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> art
               of refining it, or some improvements in its

            </p>
            <p>It is certain, that the sugar cane was found
               growing in the low, rich lands near the mouth
               of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, when <name>Europeans</name> first went to

               in <placeName rend="italic">Huanca</placeName>, by the contrivance of a
               gentleman with whom I was well acquainted. A
               servant of his, who was a subtile and ingenious
               person, observing the great quantities of sugar
               which were imported from <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, by reason
               of which the sugar of <placeName>Peru</placeName> would not sell to
               any account, advised his master to send one
               ship's lading of his sugar to <placeName>Mexico</placeName>; that
               they, seeing thereby the plenty of that commodity 
               in <placeName>Peru</placeName> might forbear to send any
               more thither. The project succeeded according
               to expectation; and now sugar works
               are erected in many places in that country.</p>

               <quote rend="quotes">At the time we landed on this island, which
               was in the beginning of <date when="1647-09">September, 1647</date>, we
               were informed, partly by those planters we
               found there, ad partly by our own observations,
               that the great work of sugar-making
               was but newly practised by the inhabitatns
               there. Some of the most industrious men,
               having gotten plants from <placeName>Ferambrock</placeName>, a place
               in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, and made trial of them at the
               <placeName>Varvadoes</placeName>, and finding them to grow, they
               planted more and more, as they grew and
               multiplied on the place, till they had such a 
               considerable number as they were worth the 
               while to set up a very small Ingenio, and so
               make a trial what sugar could be made on that
               soil. But the secrets of the work being not
               well understood, the sugards they were made were
               very inconsiderable, and little worth, for two
               or three years. But they, finding their errors
               by their daily practice, began a little to mend;
               and, by new directions from <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, sometimes
               by strangers, and now and then by their own
               people, who were content sometimes to make
               a voyage thither, to improve their knowledge

               in a thing they so much desired. Being now
               much better able to make their queries, of the 
               secrets of that mystery, by how much their
               often-failings had put them to often-stops and
               nonplusses inthe work. And-so returning
               with more plants, and better knowlege, they
               went on upon fresh hopes, but still short of
               what they should be more skilful in; for, at
               our first arrival, we found them ignorant in
               three main points that much conduced to the
               work; <abbr rend="italics">viz.</abbr> the manner of planting; the time
               of gathering; and the right placing their coppers
               in their furnaces; as also the true way of
               covering their rollers with plates or bars of
               iron. At the time of our arrival there we
               found many sugar works set up, and at work:
               but yet the sugars they made were but bare
               Muscovadoes; and few of them merchantable
               commodities; so moist, and full of molasses,
               and so ill cured, as they were hardly worth
               bringing home to <placeName>England</placeName>. But about the
               time I left the Island, which was in <date when="1650">1650</date>, they
               were much bettered; for when they had skill
               to know when the canes were ripe, which was
               not till they were fifteen months old; and
               before they gathered them at twelve, which
               was a main disadvantage to the making good
               sugar; for, the liquor wanting of the sweetness
               
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">40</fw>
               
               it ought to have caused the sugars to be
               lean,and unfit to keep. Besides, they had
               grown greater proficients both in boiling and
               curing them, and had learnt the knowledge of
               making them white, such as you call lump-
               sugars here in <placeName>England</placeName>; but not so excellent
               as those they make in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>; nor is there any
               likelihood they can ever make such; the land
               there being better, and lying in a continent,
               must needs have constanter and steadier weather,
               and the air much drier and purer than
               it can be in so small an island as that of

                  from <placeName>Arabia</placeName> and the East; and for many
                  centuries was employed for medicinal purposes
                  only. What kind or species of sugar this
                  was, or whether any of the various preparations 
                  of it now in use, has been a

                  that the <name>Arabians</name> were ignorant how it was

               <p>The <name>Arabians</name>, he observes, supposed the

                  when issuing from the joings of the cane, it is

                  that their sugar was brittle between the teeth;
                  therefore many of them call it <distinct type="dialect">Indian salt</distinct>;
                  whereas our sugar, he says, melts in the mouth,

               <p>He makes many other remarks, chiefly copied
                  from <persName>Garcias</persName> and <persName>Salmasius</persName>.
               </p>
               <p>I think it is evident, from the authors above 
                  cited, that, supposing the <distinct type="dialect">sacar mambu</distinct> if the

                  impossible it could be the saccharum of the
                  ancients.
               </p>
               <p>It is also unnecessary to contend that the
                  <distinct type="dialect">sacar mambu</distinct> of the <name>Indians</name>was not the <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct>
                  of the <name>Arabians</name>; for it appears to me that
                  neither <persName>Garcias</persName>, nor his follower <persName>Piso</persName>, were
                  positive, from their own knowledge, what the

               <p>It is certain that the <distinct type="dialect">sacar-mambu</distinct> is not
                  sweet, according to their account, and consequently
                  cannot have any relation to sugar:
                  and if it be the exuded gummous juice of the
                  mambu, or, as we call it the <distinct type="dialect">bambu-cane</distinct>, it
                  could not be sweet, for that tree contains no
                  saccharine juice. How then could this be the
                  sugar of the ancients?
               </p>
               <p>The <name>Arabians</name> had their <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct> from <placeName>India</placeName>.
                  Their account of it is fabulous. Yet they all
                  agree that it was the ashes of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> cane:
                  and whether it was a kind of pot-ash, or any 
                  other saline preparation, from vegetable
                  excineration, we cannot determine from any
                  chemical or medical facts they have left us on
                  the subject. Certain it is, there is no <emph>sweetness</emph>
                  attributed to it, and consequently it could not
                  be sugar; and, as it was given internally, whatever
                  resemblance it might have to <distinct type="dialect">spodium</distinct>, it has
                  no right to that interpretation, as the <distinct type="dialect">spodium</distinct>
                  of the <name>Greeks</name>, as already observed, was a metallic
                  preparation, and never used internally.

               <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> medical writers were chiefly

                  seem to have known but little, even of their

                  by remaining there for some time, becomes
                  white. He says also, from <persName>Mescha</persName>, that its
                  qualities depend on the nature of the trees on
                  which it falls. He has another species of

               <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> writers were all unacquainted

               <p><persName>Rhazes</persName> says, <bibl>Cap. 20. <title>de Simpicibus</title></bibl>,—

               <p>Indeed, <persName>Averroes</persName> himself, in some measure,
                  accounts for their being unacquainted with it,
                  by saying, it was not the produce of their own

               <p>However, a different inference may be drawn

               <p>What seems to have strengthened <persName>Salmasius</persName>

               <p>It may now be proper to see what the ancients

               <p>Here we have, I think, decidedly the sugar

               <p>This can be no other preparation than that

               <p>It is evident <persName>Avicenna</persName>Erroneously supposed
                  this saccharine preparation as a natrual, and not
                  as an artificial production; when, speaking of
                  the different sorts, or rather coloured sugars,
                  he compars it in appearance to salt; and says
                  it is found on canes, in the passage before

               <p>In different parts of this treatise, I have selected
                  from the <name>Arabians</name> every thing they have
                  said pertaining to the subject; but there is such
                  a want of discrimination among the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs>
                  writers, with their editors, translators, and 
                  commentators, have further perplexed with
                  
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">63</fw>
                  
                  various text, interpretations, and conjectures,
                  that it is impossible to know exactly the precise
                  distinctions, intended by the original authors,
                  in their different appellations of <distinct type="dialect">honey</distinct>, <distinct type="dialect">manna</distinct>,
                  and <distinct type="dialect">sugar</distinct>.
               </p>
               <p>However, the sugar cane is unquestionably
                  a native plant of some parts of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>; and,
                  though the art of evaporating its juice for the
                  purpose of making a common coarse, or muscovado
                  sugar, was known long before <persName>Avicenna's</persName>
                  time; yet I cannot suppose, a thousand 
                  years prior to his time, that the sugar of the
                  ancients, being sugar-candy, was made in <placeName>Arabia</placeName>;
                  especially as <persName>Avicenna</persName> himself, if we admit
                  the <emph>salt</emph> he mentions to be the same, says
                  it was brought to <placeName>Arabia</placeName> from <placeName>India</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>Yet <persName>Pliny</persName>is very particular in observing
                  that the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> sugar was superior in quality to
                  the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs>; which shews that some of the
                  sugar known to the <name>Romans</name> in his time must
                  have been brought from <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, if not 
                  manufactured there.
               </p>
               <p>Besides, we know that there is no such thing
                  as sugar found on canes; and so far from the
                  juice of the cane issuing from the plant, and
                  concreting like the gummous or vegetable rezinous juices,
                  the plant decase on being wounded; and,
                  
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">64</fw>
                  
                  without being wounded, the juice never escapes 
                  from its stem.
               </p>
               <p>Every kind of sugar whatever is made by
                  art. Native sugar never existed. Ignorant
                  people, even at this day, in our own part of 
                  the world, imagine that sugar is found, like
                  pith, inthe hollow of the canes; in the state
                  in which it is brought to <placeName>Europe</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>The crystalline appearance of sugar-candy,
                  and its fragility between the teeth, might 
                  naturally lead the ancient writers to give it the
                  appellation of <distinct type="dialect">salt</distinct>; and, from its sweetness,
                  that of <distinct type="dialect">honey of the reed</distinct>; as honey was their
                  standard of sweetness.
               </p>
               <p>It was also very natural, for people who
                  knew nothing of the process of making sugar,
                  that they should consider it, being a vegetable
                  production, as a gum; and, like other gums,
                  to be the exudations of some plant, or tree,
                  concreted by the heat of the sun.
               </p>
               <p>There can be no doubt that the sugar
                  of the ancients, and that species of sugar described
                  by the <name>Arabians</name> as resembling salt, with
                  the sweetness of honey, were the same identical
                  article; and as in the writing of the ancients
                  there is only one sort of sugar mentioned,
                  adn though that sugar is said by some
                  of them to have been brough from <placeName>Arabia</placeName>,
                  
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">65</fw>
                  
                  as well as from <placeName>India</placeName>, yet the <name>Arabians</name> themselves
                  mention it as brought from <placeName>India</placeName> only;
                  and there is every reason to believe, at that period,
                  that the art of chrystallizing the juice of
                  the cane was known only in <placeName>India</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, sugar must have been better known
                  in <placeName>Greece</placeName> and in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, from their contiguity
                  to <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, had it then been manufactured in
                  that country. Besides, there is no mention
                  among the antients of any kind of sweet canes
                  or reeds, but what were particularly said to
                  have grown in <placeName>India</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>As it is certain that sugar was brought from
                  <placeName>India</placeName> at the time when mention was first made
                  of it, it is proper to enquire whether it was
                  manufactured in <placeName>India</placeName> only; and what sort of
                  sugar was made in <placeName>India</placeName> in those times; or at
                  least to draw the best inference we can from
                  what we know of the history of the commerce
                  of sugar, and the manufacture of it in the <placeName>East
                  Indies</placeName>, at this time.
               </p>
               <p>There have ever beem, since our knowledge
                  of the East, two sorts of sugar made there;
                  raw or muscovado sugar, and sugar-candy;
                  the first used only for culinary purposes, and
                  the latter for every other purpose of diet, 
                  luxury, and exportation

               <p>The art of refining sugar, and making what
                  is called loaf-sugar, is a modern <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                  invention, the discovery of a <name>Venitian</name> about
                  the end of the 15th, or the beginning of the 16th
                  century; and not practised in <placeName>India</placeName> until very
                  lately.

               <p><placeName>China</placeName> boasts, and not without reason, of the
                  antiquity of her arts and policy over the rest
                  of the East; as well as over the rest of the 
                  world. The sugar cane is indigenous to <placeName>China</placeName>.
                  The climate and soil in many parts of 
                  <placeName>Bengal</placeName>, and other districts of the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>,
                  are also suitable to the growth and cultivation
                  of the cane; and sugar is, and we have reason
                  to suppose ever has been, produced there. Nevertheless,
                  <placeName>China</placeName> is the only country in the
                  East, even now, where sugar-candy is made in
                  perfection.
               </p>
               <p>The bright, transparent sugar-candy, so
                  beautiful in appearance, and so grateful to the
                  taste, is a peculiar manufacture, and was
                  originally invented in <placeName>China</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>It is exported from <placeName>China</placeName> to every part of 
                  <placeName>India</placeName>, and even to many countries there,
                  where abundance of sugar is made.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Du Halde</persName> says, the sugar of <placeName>China</placeName>
                  constitutes a great trade to <placeName>Japan</placeName>; and that when

                  sugar-candy so transported yields a profit of a
                  thousand per cent.
               </p>
               <p>The <name>Chinese</name>, and all the nations of the
                  East, set no estimation on any other sugar
                  than sugar-candy. They use it in tea, coffee,
                  and all other beverages; and this presence,
                  no doubt arises from judgement, as the fine
                  sugar-candy is incomparably the most delicious
                  sweet in the world. This may account for the
                  art of refining sugar into loaf-sugar never
                  having been practised in the East.

               <p>In the ancient, steady, and unchangeable

                  probable that this mode of preparing sugar, so
                  well calculated for carriage and preservation,

               <p>Some suppose it had its origin from the island
                  of <placeName>Candia</placeName> (<placeName>Crete</placeName>);—others, from <placeName>Gandia</placeName>, a
                  town in <placeName>Valencia</placeName>, in which province sugar
                  was first made in <placeName>Spain</placeName><anchor xml:id="a017" corresp="#n017"/>;—others, from the
                  <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> <distinct type="dialect">elkende—elkendit</distinct>, which simply signify
                  sugar;—and others, from the <rs type="properAdjective">Latin</rs> <distinct type="dialect">candidum</distinct>
                  (<distinct type="dialect">à candore</distinct>), bright, shining, white.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Salmasius</persName> derives it from a corrupt <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs>
                  word of the middle ages. He says,—
                  <quote xml:lang="la" rend="block">Saccharum candum, non à candore dictum,
                  nec à canna; sed καντι, vel καντον &amp; καντιον,

               </p>
               <p>But this is by no means satisfactory; for, if 
                  sugar candy had this appellation from its angular
                  figure, entire, or broken, the word
                  should be written cantum, or candium, in the

               <p><persName>Salmasius</persName> has taken the barbarous word

                  latest writers in the <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> language. His
                  writings are full fo barbarisms, and καντιον is found
                  used by him, <title>De Antidotis</title>, cap. 35,94, and
                  96, to express what the translators have rendered
                  <quote rend="quotes">saccharum appellatum candum;</quote>—the
                  sugar candy of the moderns.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Fuchsius</persName>, one of his translators, observes,
                  in the notes to cap. 35, and 94, that though
                  the word is καντιον in the manuscript copy, and
                  implies what we now call <distinct type="dialect">saccharum candi, vel
                  candidum,</distinct> yet it seems to have been written
                  originally κανδιον;—and that <distinct type="dialect">candi</distinct> is only an
                  abbreviation of <distinct type="dialect">candidum</distinct>.
               </p>
               <p>Now κανδιον, I believe, stands on no better
                  authority in the <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> language than καντιον;
                  and I think it is difficult to ascertain whether
                  the word be a corruption of the <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> κανθος,
                  or the <rs type="properAdjective">Latin</rs> <distinct type="dialect">candidum</distinct>, considering the period
                  when <persName>Myrepsus</persName>wrote.
               </p>
               <p>However, I am not inclined to give my

               <p>From <distinct type="dialect">shukur</distinct>, the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> origin, it is most
                  probable that the word sugar is derived; from

                  undergone but little variation since, in <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                  languages. And, though these particulars do 
                  not seem to have been known to the learned

               <p>To conclude this part of my subject, I think
                  there can be no doubth but that sugar-candy
                  was the first and only species of sugar known
                  to the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> antients, and that it was the

                  of <placeName>China</placeName>, the most ancient of the Eastern nations;
                  and found its way into <placeName>Europe</placeName>, as we

                  imported considerable quantities of sugar from

                  Sugar was likewise made before that time in

                  proprietors of two sugar-houses, which were
                  all that were at that time in <placeName>England</placeName>.

               <p>The profits arising from this concern were
                  at first byt very inconsiderable; as the sugar-
                  bakers at <placeName>Antwerp</placeName> supplied the <rs type="properAdjective">London</rs>
                  market at a cheaper rate than what the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
                  sugar-bakers could. After the intercourse
                  between <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Antwerp</placeName> was stopped,
                  these two sugar-houses supplied all <placeName>England</placeName>,
                  for the space of twenty years; and greatly
                  enriched the proprietors. This success induced
                  many others to embark in the same trade; a
                  number of sugar-houses were established, and
                  many persons failed, and became bankrupts.

               <p>The scurvy at the time made great ravages
                  in <placeName>England</placeName>; besides which, the fashion of the
                  day gave to the scurvy, all the minor straggling
                  indispositions that were destitute of adoption.
               </p>
               <p>Consumption of the lungs, and every other
                  species of scrophyla, are endimal in <placeName>England</placeName>.
                  Scurvy is the same. This disease, which 
                  made so much havoc in the last century, is
                  now scarcely known in <placeName>England</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>The scurvy, like any sporadic disease, may
                  have its revolutions, and appear and disappear
                  in the character of an epidemic. I do not
                  speak of scurvy aquired by local and particular
                  causes.
               </p>
               <p>It is incredible that <persName>Willis</persName> and <persName>Ray</persName>, two
                  well-informed men, should not know that the 
                  description of people most afflicted with the
                  scurvy, at all times, and in every country, is
                  that, which seldom taste any sugar.
               </p>
               <p>It is not less extraordinary that the learned
                  <persName>Willis</persName> should refer to so superficial an authority
                  as <persName>Garencieres</persName>; or the laborious <persName>Ray</persName>,
                  to the weak effusions of <persName>Simon Paulli</persName>.
               </p>
               <p>The rhapsody of <persName>Garencieres</persName> is entirely
                  his own; but that <persName>Willis</persName> advances has a
                  better stamen, but it is not his own. It is taken
                  from <persName>Angelus Sala</persName>, whom he has not
                  mentioned, and from whom he has made a
                  partial selection, merely to support his
                  favourite theory of the scurvy.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sala</persName> enumerates many evils which may
                  arise in weak habits and bad constitutions from
                  the <emph>excessive</emph>, and what he terms the <emph>abuse</emph> of
                  sugar; such as, debility of digestion; loss of
                  appetite; blackness and loosening of the
                  teeth; offensive breath; colic; lax bowels;
                  bilious, scorbutic, and hysterical complaints.
               </p>
               <p>But let it be remarked, that it is to the
                  inordinate use of sugar, among already diseased
                  people, to which <persName>Sala</persName> attributes these evils.
               </p>
               <p>For, his own reflection on the occasion is,
                  that <quote rend="quotes">the excessive use of the most excellent
                  and salutary things is always hurtful to the
                  human frame.</quote>
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sala</persName>, however, views the subject with

                  cruel thing, if not a crying sin. The argument
                  I bring from Nature's first kind tribute,
                  or inteded food for children, so soon as they
                  are born; which is, that fine juice or liquor
                  prepared in the mother's breasts, called breast-
                  milk, of a fine delicate sweet taste. This sweet is
                  somewhat analogous, or a taste agreeable,
                  to sugar; and, in what want of this milk, it is well 
                  known, sugar is brought to supply it. You
                  may soon be convinced of the satisfaction
                  which a child has from the taste of sugar, by
                  making tow sorts of water-paps, one with,
                  and the other without, sugar; they will
                  greedily suck down the one, and make faces at the

               <p>Sugar is an essential salt, consisting of an 
                  acid salt, oil, and earth. It shews no signs of
                  acid or alcali. It takes flame, and brurns
                  brightly. It dissolves easily in acqueous menstrua,
                  but not in spiritous or oily. Dissolved 
                  in water, it undergoes fermentation, and
                  acquires first a vinous, then an acetous flavour.

                  and exposed to gentle heat, in a vessel properly
                  closed, but the vessel must not be full, in a few
                  hours it will begin to ferment with great
                  vehemence; and in three or four weeks, more or
                  less, according to the quantity of liquor, and
                  warmth of the situation where it is placed, it
                  will produce a strong vinous liquor, not unlike
                  honey and water. This liquor distilled yields
                  a strong ardent spirit. If the whole fermeting
                  materials be exposed longer to a continued
                  heat, a strong vinegar, like that of wine, will
                  be produced; by the liquor changing from its
                  vinous to its acetous state.

                  and in the higher elementary brances of
                  chemical science, discoveries have been made
                  important to arts and manufactories; and also
                  for the œconomical purposes of life. Sugar 
                  has not escaped that scrutiny, which the
                  magnitued of such a subject demanded.

               <quote>
               <p>Sugar being justly considered as an
                  essential salt, it will readily be granted, that it 
                  contains an acid; this acid may be separated, and

                  exhibited in a crystalline form, by the following
                  process:—
               </p>
               <p><label>A</label> Let one ounce of the purest sugar, in
                  powder, be mixed, in a tubulated retort, with
                  three ounces of strong nitrous acid, whose specific
                  gravity is nearly 1,567
               </p>
               <p><label>B</label> When the solution is completed, and
                  the most phlogisticated part of the nitrous
                  acid has flown off, let a receiver be luted on,
                  and the solution gently boiled. In this process
                  and immense quantity of nitrous air is discharged<anchor xml:id="a030" corresp="#n030"/>.
               </p>
               <p><label>C</label>When the liquor acquires a dark-
                  brown colour, let three ounces more of nitrous
                  acid be poured on, and the boiling continued
                  until the coloured and smoking acid has entirely
                  disappeared.
               </p>
               <p><label>D</label> Let the liquor in the receiver be then
                  poured into a larger vessel; and, upon cooling,
                  small quadrilateral prismatic crystals are
                  found adhering together, at an angle generally
                  of about 45 degrees: these collected and dried
                  on a bibulous paper, weigh 109 grains.
               </p>
               <p><label>E</label> The remaining lixivium, boiled again
                  in the same retorts, with two ounces of nitrous

                  acid, until the red vapours begin to disappear,
                  upon cooing, as before, affords 43 grains of
                  saline aciculæ.
               </p>
               <p><label>F</label> If to the viscid glutinous liquor which
                  remains, there be added, at different times,
                  small quantities of nitrous acid, amounting in
                  all to two ounces, by boiling and evaporating
                  to dryness, a saline mass is at length formed,
                  brown, glutinous, and deliquescent, which,
                  when perfectly dried, weights half a drachm;
                  but in depuration nearly half of this weight is
                  lost.
               </p>
               <p><label>G</label> The crystals obtained in the manner
                  above described, are to be depurated by 
                  repeated solution and crystallization; and operation
                  which is particularly necessary to the portion
                  got, as described in (F).
               </p>
               <p>The last lixivium (F), digested with nitrous
                  acid, and evaporated to dryings by the sun's 
                  heat, exhibits prisms similar to those mentioned,
                  (D) and (E); so that this affords a method
                  of abridging the number of depurations.
               </p>
               <p><label>H</label> To obtain, therefor, one part of 
                  this salt, there ar required 3 of sugar, and 30
                  of nitrous acid. Thus it may be reckoned
                  among the most expensive slats hitherto
                  known.

               <p>It must be particularly observed, that a
                  much smaller quantity of crystals will be
                  obtained, if the boiling be continued ever so
                  little beyond the proper time.
               </p>
               <p><label>I</label> The acid thus obtained I call <distinct>acid of
                  sugar</distinct>; not because it is procurable from that
                  substance only, but because sugar affords it
                  more pure, and in greater quantity, than any
                  other matter hitherto tried.
               </p>
               <p>Thus 100 parts of gum arabic, treated as
                  above, with 900 of nitrous acid, at the beginning
                  of the boiling foam violently, and, upon
                  cooling, yield scarce more than 21 of saccharine
                  acid, prismaticallly crystallized; but at
                  the same time the solution, even to the last,
                  separates a saccharated lime, which, when
                  collected, weighs 11, and containts about 5 of the
                  acid of sugar: 8 parts of highly-rectified spirit
                  of wine, with 24 of nitrous acid, yield 3 of a 
                  saccharine acid, but, for the most part, in a
                  squamous form, and loaded with much mosture;
                  besides, honey, and whatever substance
                  contains sugar, in the same way, produces the
                  same acid; although acid of tartar, dissolved 
                  and boiled in nitrous acid, in the same
                  manner, yields a salt somewhat similar to this,
                  both in taste and squamous crystallization, yet
                  it is of a whiter colour; and, besides, is unchangeable

                  in the fire, yielding only a coal as
                  before.
               </p>
               <p>In another dissertation it will be shewn that
                  the acid of sugar occurs also in animal substances.
               </p>
               <p>This salt possesses many properties; some
                  peculiar to itself, some common to it with
                  other acids, though differing more or less in
                  degree: and these we are now to consider.
               </p>
               <p><label>A</label> The crystals have an exceeding
                  pungent taste; but a solution of these, when 
                  sufficiently diluted, excites a very agreeable
                  sensation on the tongue. Twenty grains 
                  communicate a sensible acidity to a quart of
                  water.
               </p>
               <p><label>B</label> It makes red all the blue vegetable
                  juices, except that of indigo. A single grain
                  dissolved in four ounces of water instantly
                  makes red the blue paper for covering sugar-
                  loaves; which is not affected by the weaker
                  acids: and twelve grains, dissolved in a quart
                  of water, produce the same effect upon paper
                  tinged with turnsole.
               </p>
               <p><label>C</label> It attacks alkalis, earths, and sundry
                  metals; and dissolves them with effervescence,
                  if they be united with aërial acid. These 
                  combinations serve to distinguish this evidently
                  from all other acids.

                     <p>Eighty-two parts of saccharine acid take
                        up 100 of pellucid calcareous spar, but not
                        immediately; because the surface, when saturated
                        with acid, prevents the access of the
                        acid to the internal nucleus. Nitrated lime is
                        completely precipitated by acid of sugar, in
                        the form of a white powder, not soluble in
                        water.
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the 119 parts, by weight, of this powder, 72
                        fall to the bottom, and 47 appear upon evaporation:
                        hence it is shewn that 100 parts
                        contain, of acid 48, of pure lime 46, and of
                        water 6; so that not only the presence of lime
                        in water is discovered by acid of sugar, but
                        even its quantity may, without difficulty, be
                        ascertained,
                     </p>
                     <p>The saccharine acid attacks lime with such
                        force that it separates it from every other: this
                        combination, therefore, cannot be decomposed
                        by any acid, alkali, or earth, hitherto known,
                        and can only be decomposed by fire.
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence also we understand the necessity of
                        lime-water in the purification of sugar; for,

                        the juice of the cane contains a superabundance
                        of acid, which prevents the dry concretion;
                        and even if to pure sugar dissolved in water, be
                        added the saccharine acid, it will not form
                        crystalline grains.
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, nothing more powerfully attracts
                        this acid than lime; and, when united with it,
                        it is insoluble, and either falls to the bottom, or
                        floats in the scum. Lime-water, therefore,
                        affords the most complete means of effecting
                        the crystallization; as it removes the impediment,
                        and besides, may easily be added in any 
                        proportion, without communicating any
                        heterogeneous matter.
                     </p>
                     <p>Many persons have thought that a portion
                        of the lime remains mixed with the sugar;
                        but, if the purification be properly conducted,
                        the nature of the ingredients, the circumstances
                        of the operation, and, finally, the most accurate
                        analysis, abundantly shew, that there is
                        not the smallest trace of lime remaining.
                     </p>
                     <p>Good sugar dissolves totally in distilled
                        water; which could not possibly be the case if
                        there were present any lime, either crude or
                        united with the saccharine acid; as either of 
                        these substances, wheter alone or mixed with
                        sugar, is utterly insoluble in water.

                     <p><anchor xml:id="a031" corresp="#n032"/>The vegetable alkali does indeed absorb
                        the acid of sugar, but forms with it a salt not
                        very difficult of solution; and, besides, a caustic
                        lixivion, if used in too great a quantity, will
                        dissolve a portion of the sugar. In saccharated
                        lime, the earthy basis predominates: for,
                        when boiled with syrup of violets, it strikes a
                        green colour.
                     </p>
                     <p>If we consider the nature of the acid of
                        sugar, we find that it does not resemble 
                        the nitrous acid in any other instance than 
                        those properties which are common to all
                        acids; besides, it expels the nitrous acids from
                        lime, terra ponderosa, magnesia, and metals;
                        yielding to the other acids nothing but alkalis;
                        while the nitrous acid produces salt, either
                        deliquescent or easily soluble, acid of sugar yields
                        such as are scarcely soluble in water.
                     </p>
                     <p>Alkalis, when nitrated, detonate with
                        ignited phlogiston; but, when saccharated, shew
                        not the least signs of deflagration, which they
                        evidently do upon the addition of the smallest 
                        particle of nitrous.

                        nitrous acid, united with vegetabe fixed
                        alkali, deliquesces, does not form crystals, and
                        is readily expelled by vinegar, or even by acid
                        of sugar, still more loaded with phlogiston:
                        all which circumstances by no means take 
                        place with respect to the fixed vegetable alkali
                        united with acid of sugar.
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other dissimilarities will occur upon
                        comparison; so that these acids are of a nature
                        not only unlike, but in many instances diametrically
                        opposite.
                     </p>
                     <p>If any will attribute all the difference to
                        phlogiston, I will not deny that that subtile
                        principle forms a wonderful source of difference;
                        but the difference which takes place 
                        here can by no means be attributed to this,
                        when properly examined.
                     </p>
                     <p>The nitrous acid is weakened, and made far
                        more volatile, by union with the phligiston;
                        the acid of sugar much more fixed, even when
                        loaded with os great a quantity as to be 
                        crystallizable; it almost every where expels the
                        strongest nitrous acid, as experiments shew;
                        besides, the phlogisticated nitrous acid produces,
                        with the very same matter, compounds
                        totally different from those with acid of sugar.
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be judged from circumstances

                        which are unknown, forged, or, at best,
                        possible: and among all the facts yet known,
                        concerning the acid of sugar, we can find
                        no signs of its being derived from the nitrous 
                        acid.
                     </p>
                     <p>However, let us enquire more deeply; let
                        us principally consult nature, not indifferently
                        and slightly, supplying the deficiencies with
                        fiction, but candidly and properly, by apt and
                        accurate experiments; otherwise her answers,
                        like those of the oracles of old, will be either
                        delusive or ambiguous.
                     </p>
                     <p>But, by whatever means the acid of sugar is
                        produced, it must be considered as distinct,
                        and different from all others, being always 
                        essentially and specifically the same. Its singular
                        properties, some of which are of considerable
                        use in chemistry, shew that it deserves the most 
                        particular attention.

                        (which is yet contradicted by daily observation)
                        had neglected the examination of those

                  <p>Sugar consists of a peculiar acid united to
                     a small quantity of alkali, and much fat

                     matter. It crystallizes in hexahedral
                     truncated prisms; and in this state is called sugar-
                     candy. By distillation it affords and acid 
                     phlegm, and a few drops of empyreumatic
                     oil. The residue is a spungy light coal, which
                     contains a small quantity of vegetable alkali.
                     This salt is inflammable. On hot coals it
                     melts, and swells up very much, emits a 
                     penetrating vapour, and becomes converted into a
                     brown yellow matter. It is very soluble in
                     water, to which it gives much consistence,
                     and constitutes a kind of mucilage, called
                     syrup. Syrup diluted with water is capable
                     of fermentation, and affords ardent spirit.

                     it is at present known, that a great number of
                     vegetables, which are not saccharine, afford it

                     the greatist quantity of this peculiar acid,
                     by the action of spirit of nitre, are such as do
                     not afford sugar.

                  <p>Pure sugar did not afford <persName>Bergman</persName> more
                     than one third of its weight of acid; and <persName>M.

                  <p>It seems, therefore, as <persName>M. De Morveau</persName>
                     thinks, that this acid is formed by the union
                     of a peculiar attenuated oil, which exists in
                     all organic substances, and is the same through-out;
                     and that consequently the same saccharine
                     acid is improper.

                     does not afford saccharine acid by
                     treatment with nitrous acid; though lemon
                     juice itself affords it. The vitriolic acid, 
                     employed for the purification of this acid of
                     sugar, seems therefore to decompose the oil
                     which forms the base of the saccharine acid.

                     boring certain species of the maple tree, one of

                     as also from the wild or black birch, the honey

                     being the richest, and as best enduring the long
                     and severe Winters of that climate. The juice

                     thick consistence, then taken from the fire, kept
                     stirring until its heat is abated, and set in a
                     cold place, where the sugar quickly concretes

               <p>But before I proceed in the observations I
                  have to offer the public on the dietetic and

                  submit some remakrs, the result of my literary
                  researches, to the learned and curious. This
                  may contribute to settle many vague notions
                  and erroneous opinions relative to the heraldry
                  of sugar, and the cane, of which it is the
                  produce.
               </p>
               <p>I have before observed, that the ancient

                  sugar was there unknown.

               <p>There is no record among the <name>Jews</name>, even

               <p>In the writings of <persName>Moses</persName>, and in many parts

                  <distinct type="dialect">קגה</distinct> <distinct type="dialect">Kaneh</distinct>.
               </p>
               <p>This word, passing into the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> language,
                  became the origin of <distinct type="dialect">canna</distinct>, a cane.
               </p>
               <p>But this קגה in the Bible has many 
                  significations.

               <p>As a veerb in the <name>Hebrew</name> ,קגה <distinct type="dialect">kanah</distinct> is, to
                  buy, procure, possess. קגה as a noun, property
                  which is purchased, or possessed. It is 
                  likewise a spear<anchor xml:id="a037" corresp="#n037"/>, a staff<anchor xml:id="a038" corresp="#n038"/>, a reed, or rush<anchor xml:id="a039" corresp="#n039"/>;

               </p>
               <p>It is said by several writers, that by קגה, in 
                  some places in the Bible, the <distinct type="dialect">sugar cane</distinct> is
                  meant; and consequently that this plant was
                  known to the ancient <name>Hebrews</name>. This is to
                  our present purpose, and the first object of inquiry.
               </p>
               <p>In five places only, in the Bible, this word
                  occurs, as a noun, implying an article, or
                  vegetable production; to which any use, or
                  application, is assigned as such.
               </p>
               <p>These places are in <bibl>Exodus, c. xxx. v. 23.</bibl>
                  <bibl>Canticles, c.iv. v. 14.</bibl> <bibl>Isaiah, c. xliii. v. 24.</bibl>
                  <bibl>Jeremiah, c. vi. v. 20.</bibl> and <bibl>Ezekiel, c. xxcii. vi. 19.</bibl>
               </p>
               <p>If we examine the passages here referred to,
                  we shall find that קגה has been doubtfully

               </p>
               <p><title>Jeremiah</title> represents God, as being angry

               <p>It is necessary to observe here, that, in the

               <p>That sugar is nutritious in the most eminent
                  degree has been long known. It is the basis
                  of all vegetable nutrition.
               </p>
               <p>Every root and earthly production is 
                  nutritious, in proportion to the saccharine principle
                  it contains. Nothing nourishes that is entirely
                  free from this saccharine principle; otherwise,
                  turnips would be as little nitritive as cucumbers,
                  being, like them, the sugar excepted,
                  scarcely any thing but water.
               </p>
               <p>Milk is nutritious on the same account; and
                  that milk is most nutritous which most abounds
                  with saccharine sweetness; and when milk is
                  defective in this quality, from bad pasturage
                  and other causes, our vegetable sugar should
                  be added to it, to remedy such defect.
               </p>
               <p>In all cases sugar helps the assimilation of
                  milk in the stomach; and not only prevents 
                  its curdling, and disordering that organ, but
                  corrects the tendency which milk has to injure
                  the breath, by adhering to the teeth and
                  gums, and rendering them foul and offensive.
               </p>
               <p>As milk has this property, and is much
                  used in schools, and constitutes great part of
                  the sustenance of most young people, a toothbrush
                  and water should always be employed;
                  or at least the mouth should be well rinced
                  with water, after a meal made of milk.

               <p>In regard to sugar being prejudicial to the
                  teeth, this has long been known as a prudent
                  old woman's bug-bear, to frighten children;
                  that they might not follow their natural
                  inclination, by seizing opportunities, when they 
                  are not watched, of devouring all the sugar 
                  they can find.
               </p>
               <p>This story has had a good effect among the

               <p>When milk is not the sole diet of children
                  at their mother's breast, sugar, in various 
                  mixtures and vehicles, makes the chief portion,
                  essentially, of their support.
               </p>
               <p>Sugar affords great nourishment, without
                  oppressing their tender powers of digestion.
                  The nutritive principle of their natural food
                  is thus happily imitated.
               </p>
               <p>Sugar does not create worms in children,
                  as has been often said: on the contrary, it
                  destroys worms. Some writers have mentioned
                  this<anchor xml:id="a056" corresp="#n056"/>; but my authority is my own observation.
               </p>
               <p>In the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, the negro children, from
                  crudes vegetable diet, are much afflicted with
                  worms. In crop-time, when the canes are
                  ripe, these children are always sucking them.
                  Give a negro infant a piece of sugar cane to
                  suck, and the impoverished milk of his mother
                  is tasteless to him. This salubrious luxury
                  soon changes his appearance. Worms are 
                  discharged; his enlarged belly and joints
                  diminish; his emaciated limbs increase; and, if
                  canes were always ripe, he would never be
                  diseased.

               <p>I have often seen old, scabby, wasted
                  negroes, crawl from the <distinct>hot houses</distinct>, apparently
                  half dead, in crop-time; and by sucking canes
                  all day long, they have soon become strong,
                  fat and sleaky.

               <p>The restorative power of sugar, in wasted
                  and decayed habtis, is recorded by several
                  physicians, in different parts of the world. I
                  have known many people, far advanced in
                  pulmonary consumption, recovered by the 
                  juice of the sugar cane.

               <p><persName>Fontanus</persName>, <persName>Valeriola</persName>, and <persName>Forrestus</persName>,
                  assert that they had patients cured of consumptions
                  of the lungs by a continued use of the
                  <distinct>conserve of roses</distinct>; and <persName>Reverius</persName> knew an
                  apothecary who cured himself of a confirmed
                  consumption by almost living on the conserve of
                  roses. Foreign journals are full of histories of
                  consumptions cured by this medicine.
               </p>
               <p>There are instances where people have
                  scarcely taken any other nutriment than
                  conserve of roses. Some have eaten a pound, and
                  a pound and a half, of this conserve every
                  day:—<emph>three fourths of this conserve are sugar.</emph>

               <p>The virgues of sugar are not confined to its
                  nutritive and balsamic qualities. It resists 
                  putrefaction, and preserves all substances,—flesh,
                  fruits, vegetables,—from corruption.

                  and digestion in the stomach; and qualifies

               <p>The celebrated historian <persName>Mr. Bryan

                  freely of it, derives health and vigour from its
                  use. The meagre and sickly among the negroes
                  exhibit a surprising alteration in a few

               <p>It must be observed, that muscovado, or
                  what is called mosit sugar, is laxative; and
                  that, in using the juice of the cane, either
                  as a luxury or a medicine, this also is of a
                  laxative nature, particularly with people 
                  unaccustomed to it; and sometimes it operates as
                  an active purgative, and disorders the bowels.
                  This happens frequently to <name>Europeans</name>, who
                  arrive in the sugar countries just at crop-time.
                  and, allured by its grateful novelty, take it to
                  excess.
               </p>
               <p>It has been already remarked, that when
                  vegetable sugar was first known, it was used

                  only in medicine; that it was then preferred
                  to honey, and in process of time almost entirely
                  supplanted honey; the sweet, which had
                  been in use among mankind, coeval with 
                  natural history.
               </p>
               <p>The superiority of sugar would soon be
                  discovered by observing physicians, as being
                  exempt from the uncertain, and someties
                  dangerous effects of honey.
               </p>
               <p>There are many peope whom a tea-spoonful
                  of honey will disorder. In some habits,
                  even that quantity will cause violent pains in
                  the stomach and bowels; and will act as an
                  emetic, or cathartic, or as both. In others,
                  honey will cause erysipelas, nettle rash, 
                  itching, and occasion such deleterious effects,
                  as are produced by some vegetable fungi;
                  some kinds of fishes, muscles, and poisonous
                  plants.
               </p>
               <p>Medical men who have travelled, or read,
                  or have had much experience, know what
                  extraordinary effects result from these causes.
               </p>
               <p>A melancholy instance among many I have 
                  seen, of the mischievous effects of muscles, lately
                  occurred, in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Chelsea
                  Hospital</placeName>; where a boy of seven years old was
                  destroyed by eating them; and his father
                  
                  <pb/>

                  excapted the same fate, with great difficulty,
                  after vomiting of blood, and convulsions.
               </p>
               <p>The cause of what is considered as the poison
                  of muscles, is generally supposed to arise
                  from some malignant quality inherent in the 
                  fish itself; according to the place where it is
                  found, and particular seasons. Some suppose
                  the poison consists in a kind of <distinct>stella marina</distinct>, a
                  sea insect, frequently found in muscles; whose 
                  spawn is very corrosive, and when applied to
                  the skin excoriates it.
               </p>
               <p>But the real cause is, in the indigestible 
                  property of a part of the muscle, which should
                  never be eaten; and without which, muscles
                  are innocent and nutritive.
               </p>
               <p>The noxious part of the muscles is in the hard
                  threads, or wiry filaments, by which they fasten
                  themselves to one another; to the bottom of
                  ships; and to rocks, and stones; and, as if
                  anchored by the strongest cable, no waves nor
                  current can break their hold.
               </p>
               <p>These filaments issue from an hard cartilaginous
                  sobstance, at the root of what is commonly
                  caled the tongue of the muscle, in the
                  middle of its body.
               </p>
               <p>That honey should sometimes produce the
                  ill effects I have mentioned cannot create
                  surprize; if we reflect that the bee distils from

                  Nature; and that the quality of his manufacture
                  depends on the quality of his materials.
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that honey in different countries
                  divvers so much in flavour, and consequently in
                  wholesomeness.
               </p>
               <p>They honey of some countries is poisonous to
                  everyone who makes use of it. <persName>Pompey</persName> lost
                  three regiments in <placeName>Pontus</placeName>, poisoned by honey<anchor xml:id="a061" corresp="#n061"/>;
                  and <persName>Pliny</persName> says, there is a district in that
                  country, which yields honey that makes people
                  mad who eat it.
               </p>
               <p>But the peculiar antipaty to honey, the
                  occasion of these remakrs, may be excited by
                  the essential property of some particular
                  vegetable in that multifarious compound; or,
                  most probably, by the nature of the compound
                  itself.

                  speaking, from not knowing the peculiarities,
                  by which temperaments wonderfully 
                  differ.
               </p>
               <p>The physical antipathies of children are
                  never looked for; and never discovered.
               </p>
               <p>How many infants linger in a painful manner,
                  and perish by convulsions, where no cause
                  is known or suspected!

               <p>Sudden illness not to be difined,—and sudden
                  death, without any previous indisposition,
                  or traceable vestiges on dissection after death,
                  —are subjects on which little has been said,
                  and nothing done.
               </p>
               <p>Aversion from things obnoxious to physical
                  organization, and repugnance to receive whatever
                  disturbs the functions connected by sympathy,
                  are observable in all animals.
               </p>
               <p>But this spontaneous resistence of nature, is
                  always overpowered in children; and is confounded
                  with that indiscriminate desire or disgust,
                  which perhaps would often fatally misguide
                  them.
               </p>
               <p>In advanced age, antipathies demonstrate

               <p>Rhubarb, among several articles which
                  might be mentioned, violently disorders some
                  people, of all characters of habit, and periods
                  of life. And yet this drug is forced down the
                  throad of every infant, the moment it comes
                  into the world.

               <p>Oil acts as a poison to some people; but,
                  as it does not poison every body, it is administered

                  enough: as my object here, is chiefly to
                  recommend attention to such as have the care
                  of the diet, and regimen of children; that they
                  may keep a jealous eye on the operations of
                  any article of food, or medicine, which has
                  been known to produce injurious effects in

                  chief food. After his death, his body was

                  at the age of seventy, was opened; his viscera
                  were found in the same manner; as perfect as
                  in a person of twenty: with is teeth whitem
                  and firm. He had for forty years before his
                  death used a pound of sugar daily, in his

                  his old teeth came out, pushed away by yong
                  ones; which continued so to do, until he had
                  a new set of teeth compete. He lived easy,
                  and free from pain, or sickness, until his
                  hundredth year, when he died. He used sugar to
                  a great degree in all his food, vegetable, and
                  animal: and delighted in all manner of sweet-
                  meats.

               <p><persName>Slare</persName> says, he followed the practice of his

                  ate and drank: and in the sixty-seventh year 
                  of his age, all his teeth were sound, and firm,

               </p>
               <p>The cause of this fondness for sugar was an
                  accident that happened nearly twenty years
                  ago, which prevented the person for a considerable 
                  time, swallowing any thing but fluids,
                  in which a portion of sugar was dissolved.
               </p>
               <p>The diet now consists of sugar, and the simple
                  vehicles in which it is taken; these are
                  tea, milk, gruel, barley water, roasted, and
                  boiled apples; and beer, generally for

                  His diet was impracticable in most
                  countries, from bulk, carriage, and season.
                  There is more nourishment in a pound of

                  would be at twenty pounds per annum.
               </p>
               <p>These calculations are made, reducing the

                  consumption, disposes the system to the ravages
                  of fevers; and hence the great mortality in former
                  times; when pestilential fevers and plagues
                  invaded the <name>English</name>, deeply infected by the

               <p>An article in constant use, to the extent
                  sugar now is, must have considerable influence

                  the general state of the system, exclusive of

               <p>The formation of the body, and more of

                  imagined, depend on the nature and quality
                  of our food. This I had occasion formerly to

                  acquainted—<!-- Warwick Lane. -->
               </p>
               <p>There are no distempers now in <placeName>Europe</placeName>
                  ravaging and depopulating who countries;—
                  and, I conceive, what our ancestors reprobated
                  and dreaded the importation of so much,
                  under the appellation of luxuries, has had a
                  considerable share in this alteration.
               </p>
               <p>Since <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> countries have had
                  intercourse with the <placeName>East and West Indies</placeName>, and a
                  free and enlarged traffic with each other, and
                  commerce, from the superfluities of another,
                  <placeName>Europe</placeName> has greatly improved in its regimen.
               </p>
               <p>The popular diet before was crude, coarse,
                  and unwholesome. A royal <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> dinner of the
                  twelfth century would be despised by a modern
                  tradesman. Spices, wine, sugar, and culinary
                  chemistry, made no part of the repast.
               </p>
               <p>But people have not used these bounties of
                  nature, and art, with prudence. If they have 
                  now no dread of some of the heavy calamities
                  which then made their malignant visitations
                  to the human race, there are too many who
                  have by their excesses acquired others, which
                  embitter the chronical hours of declining 
                  life.

               <p>This reflexion does not extend to labouring
                  people; they are strangers to more of foreign 
                  productions than what barely qualify their
                  food for health; and though short-lived, they
                  are providentially secured against the miseries
                  of ill-used opulence,—the derangements of gluttony
                  and repletion: the principal diseases in
                  <placeName>England</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>Diseases in general would be uniform, and
                  never undergo much alteration, were people
                  to feed only on the produce of their own soil.
                  This appears in the diseases of cattle; and also
                  in those of <name>Indians</name>; and people living in a state
                  of nature, without foreign communication: and
                  this likewise appears, in great degree, among
                  artificers and manufacterers, and such as 
                  cannot deviate in habit.
               </p>
               <p>In commercial countires, where articles of 
                  foreign growth, and dissimilar climates enter
                  into dietetic use, wit the generality of a people,
                  it is impossible that the type of their 
                  diseases should remain stationary; or that some
                  will not appear, and others disappear, from
                  any considerable change, or subversion of
                  custom.
               </p>
               <p>Within my memory the inflammatory tendency
                  of diseases in <placeName>Europe</placeName> has gradually 
                  diminished. There are not so many pleuresies

               <p>Every physician knows, that the practice
                  employed in fevers in the last century, is now
                  obsolete; and that the practice of the preceding
                  century is still more so. I speak also of 
                  diseases in general. Accurate physicians know,
                  that fevers are continually disappointing them.
               </p>
               <p>The science of medicine therefore has not
                  improved,—it has changed: because diseases
                  change. It is to be remembered that <persName>Hippocrates</persName>,
                  <persName>Celsus</persName>, and <persName>Galen</persName>, knew all that
                  was possible to be known in their time; yet
                  we cannot go by their writings; and, if they
                  had left us nothing but their prescriptions, we
                  should not now be much benefited in our
                  practice, by their labours.

               <p>The <distinct>Cow-Pox</distinct> has lately appeared in <placeName>England</placeName>.
                  This is a new star in the <rs type="properAdjective">Æsculapian</rs>
                  system. It was first observed from the Provinces.
                  It is so luminous there, that the greasy-
                  heeled hind feet of <name>Pegasus</name> are visible to the
                  naked eye: the hidden parts of that constellation,

               <p>Great events are foreboded.—Some pretend

                  were in his body, he spoke the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> language
                  fluently. When his physician cured him of
                  the disorder, he could not speak a word of that

               <p>Surgeons know that the first inflammation
                  of any membrane is the most violent: and that
                  reiterated inflammation deadens sensibility.
               </p>
               <p>But no complaint to which people are 
                  repeatedly subject, as the Cow-pox, can perform
                  all circumstances in the habit, and equivalent
                  to the Small-pox, which people never have but
                  once.
               </p>
               <p>Besides, the small-pox does not destroy the
                  disposition in the habit to receive the Cow-
                  pox.
               </p>
               <p>If that be the case, the Small-pox and the
                  Cow-pox, then, are not analogous; but
                  radically dissimilar.
               </p>
               <p>The Small-pox is undoubtedly an evil; but

                  of contemporaries. And I should not

                  success. Accidents, in the inoculated Small-
                  pox, are uncommon; and we all know from
                  experience, that disease, properly treated,

                  the Cow-pox, I hope, does not deserve the

                  a long lapse of hears? I mention this serious
                  trifling, not from disrespect to the ingenious,
                  nor to discourage inquiry; the object well
                  deserves it;—but the doctrine of engrafting
                  distempers is not yet understood by the wisest
                  men: and I wish to guard parents against
                  suffering their children becoming victims to
                  experiment.—What misery may be brought on

                  by accidental contact, when the ulcerous matter

               <p>The <distinct>yaws</distinct> differs althogether from every other
                  disorder, in its origin, progress, and
                  termination.
               </p>
               <p>Left to itself, it sometimes departs in 9, 12, 
                  15, or 18 months, without leaving behind it
                  any inconveniency. Sometimes it remains
                  much longer, and ends in shocking nodes,
                  and distortions of the bones. Many are
                  destroyed by it. No person is subject to it twice.
               </p>
               <p>From want of care and proper management,
                  the torments of the <distinct>yaws</distinct> surpass all
                  description from the <distinct>bone ache</distinct>, and dreadful
                  agonizing curvatures, and caries of the legs, arms,
                  collar-bones, wrists, and almost every other
                  bone, and articulation in the body.
               </p>
               <p>There is also, sometimes, a relic after the
                  original malady is gone, called the <distinct>master yaw</distinct>;
                  this is an inveterate ulcer, proceeding from 
                  the largest <distinct>yaw</distinct>, or chief determination of the
                  eruption.
               </p>
               <p>Generally, this distemper terminates in what
                  are called <distinct>crab yaws</distinct>. These are painful sores,
                  or cracks in the feet. Sometimes spongy, sometimes
                  hard and callous.
               </p>
               <p>There are two sorts of <distinct>yaws</distinct>, like the two
                  species of <distinct>Farcy</distinct> in horses; the <distinct>common yaws</distinct>
                  and the <distinct>running yaws</distinct>.
               </p>
               
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">168</fw>
               
               <p>The <distinct>common yaws</distinct>, without fever or
                  indispositon, begins with small pimples, which soon
                  increase, and appear in round, white, flabby,
                  eruptions, from about the size of a pea to that
                  of a large strawberry, separately, or in clusters,
                  in different parts of the body. These eruptions 
                  do not appear all at once; and, when
                  some are declining, and others disappearing, a
                  fresh crop comes out in a different part of the
                  body. Sometimes a few doses of sulphur will
                  force them out, when they are thought to be
                  entirely gone from the habit.
               </p>
               <p>The <distinct>running yaws</distinct> breaks out in spreading
                  cutaneous ulcers, discharging a great quantity
                  of acrid corrosive matter, in different parts of
                  the body. This is the worst sort.
               </p>
               <p>The cure of the yaws is now understood by
                  skilful practitioners. Inoculation is performed
                  with success. Care soon removes the principal
                  mischief of the distemper; and the <distinct>crab yaws</distinct>
                  are easily cured in the manner which I have
                  related in another publication<anchor xml:id="a077" corresp="#n077"/>.
               </p>
               <p>Formerly there was no regular method of 
                  treating the <distinct>yaws</distinct> in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. It was
                  thought to be a disorder that would have its
                  course, and, if interrupted, that it would be

                  dangerous. It was then the custom, when a
                  negro was attacke with it, to separate him
                  from the rest, and send him to some lonely
                  place by the sea sied, to bathe; or into the
                  mountains, to some Provision Ground, or Plantain
                  Walk; where he could act as a watchman,
                  and maintain himself, without any expence
                  to the estate, until he was well; then he
                  was brought back to the Sugar work.

               <p>But this rarely happened. I cold, damp,
                  smoky hut, for his habitation; snakes and 
                  lizards is companions; crude, viscid food, and
                  bad water, his only support; and shunned as
                  a leper;—he usually sunk from the land of the
                  living.

               <p>But some of these abandoned exiles lived, in
                  spite of the common law of nature, and survived
                  a general mutation of their muscles, ligaments,
                  and osteology; became also hideously
                  white in their wooly hair and skin; with their
                  limbs and bodies twisted and turned, by the
                  force of the distemper, into shocking grotesque
                  figures, resembling woody excrescences, or
                  stumps of trees; or old <rs type="properAdjective">Egyptian</rs> figures, that
                  seem as if they had been made from the ends of
                  the uman, and the beginnings of the brutal form;
                  which figures are, by some antiquaries, taken
                  for gods, and by others, for devils.

               <p>In their banishment, their huts often became
                  the receptacles of robbers and fugitive negroes;
                  and, as they had no power to resist any who
                  chose to take shelter in their hovels, and had
                  nothing to lose, and were forsaken by the world,
                  a tyger would hardly molest them. Their

               <p>The host of the hut, as he grew more

                  images in wax, the hearts of birds, and some

               <p>These magicians will interrogate the patient,

                  This part they will torture with pinching,
                  drawing with gourds, or calabashes, beating,
                  and pressing. When the patient is nearly

               <p>It is the province of the <rs type="persGroup">Obi-women</rs> to

                  and his skill in retreating into difficult fastnesses,
                  commanding the only access to them,
                  where none dared to follow him, he terrified
                  the inhabitants, and set the civil power, and

                  There were a few runaway negroes in the

                  He scorned assistance. He ascended above

                  negroes, named <persName>Quashee</persName> and <persName>Sam</persName> (<persName>Sam</persName>
                  was <persName>Captain Davy's</persName> son. he who shot a
                  <persName>Mr. Thompson</persName>, the master of a <rs type="properAdjective">London</rs> ship,
                  at <placeName>Old Harbour</placeName>), both of <placeName>Scots Hall Maroon
                  Town</placeName>, with a party of their townsmen, went
                  in search of him.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Quashee</persName>, before he set out on the expedition, 
                  got himself christianed, and changed his
                  name to <persName>James Reeder</persName>.
               </p>
               <p>The expedition commenced; and the whole
                  party had been creeping about in the woods,
                  for three weeks, and blockading, as it were, the
                  deepest recesses of the most inacessible part of 
                  the island, where <persName>Jack</persName>, far remote from all
                  human society, resided,—but in vain.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Reeder</persName> and <persName>Sam</persName>, tired with this mode of
                  war, resolved on proceeding in search of his
                  retreat; and taking him, by storming it, or
                  perishing in the attempt.
               </p>
               <p>They took with them a little boy, a proper
                  spirit, and a good shot, and left the rest of the
                  party.
               </p>

               <p>These three, whom I well knew, had not 
                  been long separated, before their cunning
                  eyes discovered, by impressions among the
                  weeds and bushes, that some person must have
                  lately been that way.
               </p>
               <p>They softly followed these impressions, making 
                  not the least noise. Presently they discovered
                  a smoke.
               </p>
               <p>They prepared for war. They came upon
                  <persName>Jack</persName> before he perceived them. He was
                  proasting plantains, by a little fire on the
                  ground, at the mouth of a cave.
               </p>
               <p>This was a scene:—not where ordinary actors
                  had a common part to play.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Jack's</persName> looks were fierce and terrible. He 
                  told them he would kill them.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Reeder</persName>, instad of shooting <persName>Jack</persName>, replied,
                  that his Obi had no power to hurt him; for
                  he was christianed; and that his name was no
                  longer <persName>Quashee</persName>.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Jack</persName> knew <persName>Reeder</persName>; and as if paralysed,
                  he let is two guns remain on the ground, and took up only his cutlass.
               </p>
               <p>These two had a desperate engagement
                  several years before, in the woods; in whic
                  conflict <persName>Jack</persName> lost the two fingers, which was
                  the origin of his present name; but <persName>Jack</persName> then
                  beat <persName>Reeder</persName>, and almost killed him with
                  
                  <pb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">178</fw>
                  
                  veral others who assisted him, and they fled
                  from <persName>Jack</persName>.
               </p>
               <p>To do <persName>Three fingered Jack</persName> justice, he would
                  now have killed both <persName>Reeder</persName> and <persName>Sam</persName>; for,
                  at first, they were frightened at the sight of
                  him, and the dreadful tone of his voice; and
                  well they might: they had been besides no retreat,
                  and were to grapple wit hthe bravest, and 
                  strongest man in the world.
               </p>
               <p>But <persName>Jack</persName> was cowed; for, he had prophesied,
                  that <emph>white</emph> Obi would get the better of 
                  him; and, from experience, he knew the
                  charm would lose none of its strength in the
                  hands of <persName>Reeder</persName>.
               </p>
               <p>Without further parley, <persName>Jack</persName>, with his
                  cutlass in hand, threw himself down a precipice
                  at the back of the cave.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Reeder's</persName> gun missed fire. <persName>Sam</persName> shot him
                  in the shoulder. <persName>Reeder</persName>, like an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
                  bull-dog, never looked, but, with is cutlass 
                  in his hand, plunged headlong down after
                  <persName>Jack</persName>. The descent was about thirty yards,
                  and almost perpendicular. Both of them
                  had preserved their cutlasses in the fall.
               </p>
               <p>Here was the stage,—on which two of the
                  stoutest hearts, that were ever hooped with
                  ribs, began their bloody struggle.
               </p>

               <fw type="pageNum">179</fw>
               
               <p>The little boy, who was ordered to keep
                  back, out of harm's way, now reached the 
                  top of the precipice, and during the fight,
                  shot <persName>Jack</persName> in the belly.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sam</persName> was crafty, and coolly took a round
                  about way to get to the field of action. When
                  he arrived at the spot where it began, <persName>Jack</persName>
                  and <persName>Reeder</persName> had closed, and tumbled together
                  down another precipice, on the side of the 
                  mountain, in which fall they both lost their 
                  weapons.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sam</persName> descended after them, who also lost his
                  cutlass, among the trees and bushes in gettign
                  down.
               </p>
               <p>When he came to them, though without
                  weapons, they were not idle; and, luckily for
                  <persName>Reeder</persName>, <persName>Jack's</persName> wounds were deep and
                  desperate, and he was in great agony.
               </p>
               <p><persName>Sam</persName> came up just time enough to save
                  <persName>Reeder</persName>; for, <persName>Jack</persName> had caught him by the
                  throat, with his giant's grasp. <persName>Reeder</persName> then
                  was with his right hand almost cut off, an
                  <persName>Jack</persName> streaming with blood from his shoulder
                  and belly; both covered with gore and gashes.
               </p>
               <p>In this state <persName>Sam</persName> was umpire; and decided
                  the fate of the battle. He knocked <persName>Jack</persName>
                  down with a piece of a rock.
               </p>

               <p>When the lion fell, the two tigers got upon
                  him, and beat his brains out with stones.
               </p>
               <p>The little boy soon after found his way to
                  them. He had a cutlass, with which they cut
                  off <persName>Jack's</persName> head, and three-fingered hand,
                  and took them in triumph to <placeName>Morant Bay</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>There they put their trophies into a pail of
                  rum; and followed by a vast concourse of
                  negroes, now no longer afraid of <persName>Jack's</persName> Obi,
                  they carried them to <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, and <placeName>Spanish
                  Town</placeName>; and claimed the reward of the King's 
                  Proclamation, and the House of Assembly.

               <p>But to return to medicine's melancholy
                  road.
               </p>
               <p>In <placeName>North America</placeName>, lately, the Plague has
                  burst on the inhabitants. It first appeared at
                  <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in <date when="1793-08">August, 1793</date>
               </p>
               <p><persName>Doctor Benjamin Rush</persName>, of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,
                  a physician of the most distinguished learning
                  and talents, has given an interesting account
                  of this calamity. He has denominated this
                  pestilence the <distinct>Bilious Remitting Yellow Fever</distinct> of
                  <placeName>America</placeName>; from its being accompanied by the
                  terrible complexion, and other pathognomonics,
                  which I have given of the <distinct>Endemial Causas</distinct>,
                  or, as it is commonly called, the <distinct>Yellow Fever</distinct>
                  
                  <pb/>

                  of the <placeName>Est Indies</placeName>; and from its yielding, as
                  he has shewn, to the same means I used in 
                  that fever, and have published in my <title rend="italic">Treatise
                  on Tropical Diseases.</title>
               </p>
               <p>Ferom the mortality that has happened, at
                  different periods, from the <distinct>Yellow Fever</distinct>, since its
                  first appearance in <placeName>America</placeName>, I am sorry to conclude
                  that no successful method of treating it
                  has been adopted by practitioners, and 
                  universally agreed on.
               </p>
               <p>It seems that <placeName>America</placeName> is now suffering the
                  same fate which <placeName>England</placeName> formerly
                  experiencedl and that this <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> plague, like
                  the plagues in <placeName>England</placeName>, will exhaust in the
                  inscrutable cause which feeds its rage, and then
                  will vanish. <placeName>England</placeName> was relieved from the
                  plague, without any general rational method
                  of cure being adopted, or without physicians
                  knowing more how it cane, or went away,
                  than we do when it will return.
               </p>
               <p>This is a subject of concern; but not of surpries
                  Veteran physicians in times of danger
                  generally desert the field; intrench themselves
                  far off, behind old books, and leave raw
                  recruets to fight the foe: who, experienced
                  in the tactics of the physic, seldon escape the 
                  recoil of their own artillery; and fall with their
                  patients.
               </p>

               <p>It was natural for <persName>Hippocrates</persName>, who
                  lived in a country, where particular winds
                  regularly produced certain diseases, to attribute
                  all epidemics to some condition of the air,
                  that was cognizable to our senses.
               </p>
               <p>But <persName>Sydenham</persName>, who, we all know, was a
                  sagacious observer of nature, though he
                  thought with <persName>Hippocrates</persName> as to the
                  atmospheric origin of epidemics, yet he contended
                  that there was some secret and unknown
                  quality in the air, not reducible to demonstration,
                  by the divisions and subdivisions of
                  theory, in which the <rs type="properAdjective">Pandoran</rs> mischief of
                  epidemics lies concealed.
               </p>
               <p>There are annual or seasonal disorders,
                  more or less severe, in all countries; but the
                  Plague, and other great depopulating epidemics,
                  do not always obey the seasons of the
                  year.
               </p>
               <p>Like comets, their course is excentric. They
                  have their revolutions; but from whence they
                  come, or whither they go after they have made
                  their revolutions, no mortal can tell.
               </p>
               <p>All epidemics properly belong to either
                  spring or autumn. When they break out in
                  winter, or very early in the spring, they
                  generally prove the most malignant and destructive.
                  The same may be said of autumnal epidemics,

                  in regard to their premature appearance, in
                  summer.
               </p>
               <p>Vernal pestilential diseases, and plagues,
                  terminate, or become mild, or quiescent, in
                  hot weather. Autumnal diseases, in cold weather.
                  The measles and small-pox, when epidemic,
                  do the same.
               </p>
               <p>The plagues of <date when="1119">1119</date>, <date when="1656">1656</date>, and several
                  others in <placeName>England</placeName>; of <date when="1348">1348</date>, in <placeName>Venice</placeName>; of
                  <date when="1713">1713</date>, in <placeName>Dantzig</placeName>, <placeName>Hamburg</placeName>, and <placeName>Stockholm</placeName>;
                  all broke out during the frost in winter; and
                  most of them declined with the summer heat.
                  Such was the case with the plauge at <placeName>Toulon</placeName>,
                  in <date when="1721">1721</date>; and so it is with the plagues at
                  <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, and <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, when they make their
                  appearance in February.

               <p>No person ever knew the cause of the <distinct>Sweating

               <p>To look for the cause of an epidemic in the
                  present state of the air, or weather, when it
                  makes its appearance, is a very narrow, contracted,

               <p>The cause of a pestilence in summer, may be
                  in the changes which the earth, and consequently
                  its surrounding atmosphere, underwent
                  in the preceding wingerl and from 
                  combinations, perhaps, far beyond our scope of
                  thought, for years prepatory to its eruption.
               </p>
               <p>In a new country like <placeName>North America</placeName>, where
                  immense districts of the surgace of the earth,
                  which from the creation never saw the sun,
                  have been exposed, for agriculture, the air of
                  the country must have been impregnated from
                  exhalations injurious, probably, to is salubrity.
               </p>
               <p>The <name>Americans</name> are not to look for the cause
                  of their <distinct>Yellow Fever</distinct>, on dunghills, in rotten
                  vegetable substances, and about the wharfs
                  and neighbourhood of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. Nature
                  does not deal in such commodities. She does
                  nothing on so small a scale.
               </p>
               <p>This pestilence has a far more expanded 
                  origin. And I verily believe, that their 
                  melancholy officers of health; avoiding what they
                  call infected persons; and putting marks on
                  the doors and windows of an house where
                  any person is ill, and similar acts of charitable

                  and good intention, only tend to frighten the
                  people; and dishearten them, at a time they
                  stand most in need of fortitude.

               <p>Exposing the well-known umbrous <distinct>Pontini</distinct>
                  marshes, by cutting down the woods, which
                  kept their foul vapours from being rarified by
                  the sun, and borne away by the winds, produced 
                  great pestilence in Italy.
               </p>
               <p>The idea also of the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> plague being
                  imported from <distinct>Bulam</distinct>, or any other place, is
                  repugnant to reason. I was told a similar tale,
                  when I first went to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>: that the
                  <distinct>Yellow Fever</distinct> there, was imported in the 
                  beginning of the century from <placeName>Siam</placeName>. That it was
                  a contagious, and an original putrid disease;
                  and that bleeing was death. In my practice
                  I proved the reverse of all this.
               </p>
               <p>The cause of pestilential epidemics, cannot
                  be confined, and local. It must lie in the 
                  atmosphere, which surrounds, and is in contact
                  with every part of us; and in which we are 
                  immersed, as bodies in fluids.
               </p>
               <p>These diseases not appearing in villages, and
                  thinly inhabited places, and generally attacking
                  only great towns and cities, may be, that
                  the atmosphere, which I conceive to be the
                  universal propagator of pestilence, wants a
                  commixture, or union, with some compaounded,
                  
                  <pb/>

                  and peculiar air, such as is generated in 
                  popular communities,—to separate, or release its
                  imprisoned virulence, and give it force.
               </p>
               <p>The ancient writers on medicine, and indeed
                  all others, which I have read, assert, that the
                  operation, of whatever they assign to be the
                  cause of epidemical fevers,—is solely on the
                  blood and fluids. This may be doubted.
               </p>
               <p>The impressions of the atmosphere, on the 
                  surface of the body, when contained, or
                  deprived of vitality, like East winds, are as
                  perceptible, as the effects of approaching, or
                  retreating from, a fire.
               </p>
               <p>In the common order of pestilential fevers,
                  they commence with coldness, and shivering;
                  simply demonstrating, that something unusual
                  has been in contact with the skin, agonizing
                  cutanoeus sensibility.
               </p>
               <p>The skin is covered with the extremities of
                  fibres, nerves, and vessels;—these are in the
                  most exposed situation, with the least power
                  of resistng external injury.—Hence a destruction,
                  or a privation of their elasticity, and
                  restraining power, from a poisoned atmosphere.
                  —And hence I conceive that the first blow in
                  these fevers is made, on the solids;—the
                  strength of the whole frame is thus prostrated
                  in a moment, and every nerve and muscle
                  paralysed.
               </p>

               <p>Sickness at the stomach, and an immoveable
                  pressure about the præcordia follow. These
                  demonstrate, that the blood cannot pervade
                  the extremities of the body, and that the
                  quantity which ought to dilate through the
                  whole machine, is confined to the larger
                  organs, and is crowding, and distending the
                  heart, and central vessels.
               </p>
               <p>The restraining power of the remoter blood
                  vessels being destroyed, the thinner parts of the
                  blood escape their boundaries; hence arises
                  yellowness in the skin, in some climates:—in
                  others, the grosser parts of the blood stagnate,
                  forming black lodgements, bubo, anthrax, and
                  exanthemata.
               </p>
               <p>The object in these fevers, is to decide the
                  contest between the solids and the fluids; and
                  this appears to me, to be the only practicable,
                  by draining the vital parts, by bleeding and
                  purging, before the fluids have burst their
                  confines, and dissolved their bond of union
                  with the solids.—The next step is to regain
                  the lost energy of the sruface of the body,
                  by exciting perspiration; and then of the
                  whole system, by tonics.
               </p>
               <p>When these things are not done in the first
                  hours of attack, in pestilential fevers, and
                  the conflict is not <emph>extinguished</emph> at once,—bark,
