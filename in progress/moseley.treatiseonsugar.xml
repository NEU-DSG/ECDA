            <p>Much time has elapsed since the cultivation

               and <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> in almost general use. Yet no per-
               son hitherto has connected any regular series
               of facts on the subject; a subject of the first 
               importance in commerce: and, more than 
               that, a subject now influencing the dispositions
               to health or disease, of the greater part of the
               inhabitants of the earth.

            <p>The materials which present themselves for
               my purpose, are disjointed and contradictory.
               The rays, which scarcely illumine the surface
               of the mass I am to penetrate, are feeble and 
               confused. To discover a foundation, on which 
               order and arrangement may rise, I must toil
               through trackless regions of obscurity.

               grows a tree, now called <hi rend="slant(italic)">Til</hi>, but, in the lan-
               guage of the antient inhabitants, Garse, i.e.

            <p>The <ecda:commodity>sugar cane</ecda:commodity> is supposed to have been

               are planted in low wet grounds, well mucked

               furrows. They cut the <ecda:commodity>canes</ecda:commodity> close to the roots
               in November and December, and, cutting off 
               the slender tops, which afford no good juice,
               keep them under ground till March, and then

               They sell them at <placeName>Gandia</placeName> to eat, and, cutting

               knots, suck the pieces at both ends. To make
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, after the <ecda:commodity>canes</ecda:commodity> are cleansed from the 
               tops and leaves, and cut to pieces, they are
               first bruised, either with a perpendicular stone
               running round, as <ecda:commodity>apples</ecda:commodity> to make <ecda:commodity>cyder</ecda:commodity>, or

               capped with iron, horizontally placed, and
               turned contrary ways; and then pressed as
               <ecda:commodity>grapes</ecda:commodity> or <ecda:commodity>olives</ecda:commodity> are. The juice thus pressed
               out is boiled in three several cauldrons, one
               after another. In the third cauldron it be-
               comes thick and black, and is then put into
               conical pots, which at the bottom have a lit-
               tle hole stopped only with coarse and foul
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>. These pots are covered when full
               with a cake of paste, made of a kind of
               earth called the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> <foreign xml:lang="sp">gritty</foreign>, and found near

               juice drains down through the coarse <placeName>sugar</placeName> at
               the bottom. It drains for five or six months,
               in which time the <placeName>sugar</placeName> in the conical pots

               grows hard, and white, all the juice being
               drunk up by the lute, or run out by the hole
               in the vertex. The juice is boiled again, so
               long as it is good for any thing; but at last it
               makes only a foul <ecda:commodity>red sugar</ecda:commodity>, that will never
               be better. The conical loaves of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, after
               they are taken out, are set to drain over the
               same pots for 14 or 15 days. To make the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               more white, they must boil it again, but about
               one-sixth is lost every time. A pound of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               of 12 ounces is sold at Olives for three <measure rend="slant(italic)">sous</measure> and
               an half; refined for five or six <measure rend="slant(italic)">sous</measure>. The <ecda:commodity>su-
               gar</ecda:commodity> juice is strained through strainers of <ecda:commodity>linen</ecda:commodity>,
               and is put out of one cauldron into another.
               They take it out of the first and second caul-
               drons so soon as it begins to boil; but in the
               third cauldron they let it boil till the scum
               rises, and then take off only the scum with the
               scummer, and put it into a long trough, to
               cool; and, when it is cool, put it into the co-
               nical pots. One scum rises after another in the 
               third cauldron. The scum, when it is taken
               off, is white, but turns to a black liquor in the
               trough. They never refine the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> more
               than three or four times. They use for the re-
               fining of it whites of eggs, putting in two or
               three dozen into a cauldron. They use but one
               cauldron for refining. When it is refined, it

               grows hard and white in nine or ten days.
               When they refine it, they put a little water
               into the cauldron, to dissolve it the better.</quote>

            <p>The island of <placeName>Madeira</placeName> is supposed, like the

               ascertain in which of the islands the cane was
               found, an in which it was not. We know it
               was seen in some of them: but, from modern
               navigators, we have proofs that it grows
               spontaneously in all the islands in the <placeName>South Sea</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>It was found in great abundance in all the

            <p>Some plants of these canes have lately been

               astonishing increase of sugar, which those brought
               from <placeName>Otaheite</placeName> and planted in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> yield
               over those of the island, shews, if there be not

            <p>The method of propagating the sugar cane
               is by cuttings from the top of it, and we know 
               of no other method; though <persName>Mr. Bruce</persName> says,
               In <placeName>Abyssinia</placeName> it is raised from the seed. Of this

            <p>The progress of cultivating the cane for the
               purposes of making sugar, has given rise to the 
               erroneous supposition, that the migration of
               the sugar cane, under the <name>Europeans</name>, was
               from <placeName>Sicily</placeName> and <placeName>Spain</placeName>, to the <placeName>Madeira</placeName> and
               <placeName>Canary islands</placeName>; and afterwards to the <placeName>West
               Indian islands</placeName>, <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, <placeName>Peru</placeName>, and Brazil: and
               that it was not an original plant of those
               islands and countries.

            <p>There is, besides, great difficulty in distinguishing,
               in the journals of voyagers, between
               the history of the plant and its produce. For,
               often when some particular period is mentioned,
               when the sugar cane was first carried to
               countries, the fact is, that such period was the
               time when the cultivation of the plant, for
               the purposes of making sugar, was introduced;
               which before was either entirely neglected, or
               the use of simple juice only known: and
               frequently mention is made when sugar was
               first produced in some countries, which in
               reality was the period when the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> art
               of refining it, or some improvements in its 
               manufacture, was carried thither.
            </p>
            <p>It is certain, that the sugar cane was found
               growing in the low, rich lands near the mouth
               of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, when <name>Europeans</name> first went to

               our first arrival, we found them ignorant in
               three main points that much conduced to the
               work; <abbr rend="italics">viz.</abbr> the manner of planting; the time
               of gathering; and the right placing their coppers
               in their furnaces; as also the true way of
               covering their rollers with plates or bars of
               iron. At the time of our arrival there we
               found many sugar works set up, and at work:
               but yet the sugars they made were but bare
               Muscovadoes; and few of them merchantable
               commodities; so moist, and full of molasses,
               and so ill cured, as they were hardly worth
               bringing home to <placeName>England</placeName>. But about the
               time I left the Island, which was in <date when="1650">1650</date>, they
               were much bettered; for when they had skill
               to know when the canes were ripe, which was
               not till they were fifteen months old; and
               before they gathered them at twelve, which
               was a main disadvantage to the making good
               sugar; for, the liquor wanting of the sweetness

               <fw type="pageNum">40</fw>
               
               it ought to have caused the sugars to be
               lean,and unfit to keep. Besides, they had
               grown greater proficients both in boiling and
               curing them, and had learnt the knowledge of
               making them white, such as you call lump-
               sugars here in <placeName>England</placeName>; but not so excellent
               as those they make in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>; nor is there any
               likelihood they can ever make such; the land
               there being better, and lying in a continent,
               must needs have constanter and steadier weather,
               and the air much drier and purer than
               it can be in so small an island as that of
               <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>.</quote>

               <head>History of Sugar</head>
               <p>Sugar was first brought into <placeName>Europe</placeName>
                  from <placeName>Arabia</placeName> and the East; and for many
                  centuries was employed for medicinal purposes
                  only. What kind or species of sugar this
                  was, or whether any of the various preparations 
                  of it now in use, has been a
                  subject of much controversy in antiquarian
                  literature.

                  <name>Indians</name>, was the <!-- greek -->, or sugar, of the

               <p>He also says, this <distinct type="dialect">sacar mambu</distinct> of the <name>Indians</name>
                  was the <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct> of the <name>Arabians</name>; but
                  that the <name>Arabians</name> were ignorant how it was
                  produced, as were the ancient <name>Greeks</name> of the <distinct type="dialect">generatio
                  Mellis Calamini, sive <!-- greek --></distinct>; who thought 
                  it was the dew, which, falling on the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> 
                  canes, concreted: and that it was a kind of 
                  manna.
               </p>
               <p>The <name>Arabians</name>, he observes, supposed the
                  <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct> to be the ashes of the cane; and
                  certainly, he says, this species of sugar, when
                  concreted and coagulated, islike ashes; but,
                  when issuing from the joings of the cane, it is 
                  white like starch. The atnients remark also,
                  that their sugar was brittle between the teeth;
                  therefore many of them call it <distinct type="dialect">Indian salt</distinct>;
                  whereas our sugar, he says, melts in the mouth,
                  and is not brittle.
               </p>
               <p>He contends that the <name>Arabians</name> were in an
                  error respecting their <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct>; and that it was

                  of the <name>Indians</name> and the real <!-- greek --> of
                  the <name>Greeks</name>. He says the antients gave it the
                  appellation of sugar, which the <name>Arabians</name> did
                  not; because they believed it to be the ashes,
                  and not a species of sugar whichwas called
                  by them <distinct type="dialect">zuchar</distinct>.
               </p>
               <p>He says the cane, from which the fictitious 
                  sugar now in use is made, is a small plant;
                  but that in the <placeName>Indies</placeName>, which yields the <distinct type="dialect">sachar-
                  mambu</distinct> of the <name>Indians</name>, the <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct> of the
                  <name>Arabians</name>, or native sugar of the antients, is a
                  large tree; and that this species of sugar is the
                  concreted exudation from the tree, found about 
                  the joints.

               <p><persName>Salmasius</persName> at length attempts, as a farther

               <p>Now it is evident, from the testimony of the

               <p>The translators, as their originals before

                  or roots: and being of a greyish colour, like

                  ashes. But as it was given internally, it certainly

               <p>I think it is evident, from the authors above 
                  cited, that, supposing the <distinct type="dialect">sacar mambu</distinct> if the

                  ancients.
               </p>
               <p>It is also unnecessary to contend that the

                  positive, from their own knowledge, what the

               <p>It is certain that the <distinct type="dialect">sacar-mambu</distinct> is not
                  sweet, according to their account, and consequently
                  cannot have any relation to sugar:
                  and if it be the exuded gummous juice of the
                  mambu, or, as we call it the <distinct type="dialect">bambu-cane</distinct>, it
                  could not be sweet, for that tree contains no
                  saccharine juice. How then could this be the

               <p>The <name>Arabians</name> had their <distinct type="dialect">tabaxir</distinct> from <placeName>India</placeName>.
                  Their account of it is fabulous. Yet they all
                  agree that it was the ashes of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> cane:
                  and whether it was a kind of pot-ash, or any 
                  other saline preparation, from vegetable
                  excineration, we cannot determine from any
                  chemical or medical facts they have left us on
                  the subject. Certain it is, there is no <emph>sweetness</emph>
                  attributed to it, and consequently it could not
                  be sugar; and, as it was given internally, whatever
                  resemblance it might have to <distinct type="dialect">spodium</distinct>, it has
                  no right to that interpretation, as the <distinct type="dialect">spodium</distinct>
                  of the <name>Greeks</name>, as already observed, was a metallic

               <p>Indeed, <persName>Averroes</persName> himself, in some measure,
