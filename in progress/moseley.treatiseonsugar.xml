               and <commodity>sugar</commodity> in almost general use. Yet no per-

               of facts on the subject; a subject of the first 
               importance in commerce: and, more than 
               that, a subject now influencing the dispositions
               to health or disease, of the greater part of the
               inhabitants of the earth.

               The rays, which scarcely illumine the surface

               confused. To discover a foundation, on which 
               order and arrangement may rise, I must toil

               with a valley, which is terminated by the steep

               they call this kind <foreign rend="slant(italic)">pansas</foreign>, and they seem to be
               the <foreign rend="slant(italic)">duracinæ</foreign> of the antients. They are all
               white, round, and have a tougher skin than
               other <commodity>grapes</commodity>. They gather them when fully 
               ripe, and dip them in a boiling lixivium of
               water and ashes, just dipping them in, and ta-
               king them out again; and then dry them upon
               boards in the sun, taking them in by night,
               or in foul weather. The name raisin comes
               from <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">racemus</foreign>. <commodity>Figs</commodity> are dried just as they
               are gathered, not being dipped in any lixi-
               vium.</quote>

            <p><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">I went to <placeName>Olives</placeName>, in <placeName>Valencia</placeName> also, where,
               and at <placeName>Gandia</placeName>, are the engines for <commodity>sugar-works</commodity>;
               the best are at <placeName>Olives</placeName>. By the way we saw the
               <commodity>sugar canes</commodity> growing in several places. They
               are planted in low wet grounds, well mucked
               and dressed, divided into beds or hillocks, and
               furrows. They cut the <commodity>canes</commodity> close to the roots
               in November and December, and, cutting off 
               the slender tops, which afford no good juice,
               keep them under ground till March, and then
               prick them into these hillocks or beds; out of
               every <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">talea</foreign>, or cut, shoot four, five, or six,
               <commodity>canes</commodity>, which will be ripe next December.
               The knots, or joints of the <commodity>cane</commodity> at the bot-
               tom are very close together, scarce an inch
               asunder; but upwards the distance is more, as
             
      <pb n="017"/>
               the <commodity>cane</commodity> grows slenderer. Within is a white
               pulp, or pith, full of <commodity>sap</commodity> sweet as <commodity>honey</commodity>.
               They sell them at <placeName>Gandia</placeName> to eat, and, cutting
               them in pieces just in the middle between two
               knots, suck the pieces at both ends. To make
               <commodity>sugar</commodity>, after the <commodity>canes</commodity> are cleansed from the 
               tops and leaves, and cut to pieces, they are
               first bruised, either with a perpendicular stone
               running round, as <commodity>apples</commodity> to make <commodity>cyder</commodity>, or
               <commodity>olives</commodity> to make <commodity>oil</commodity>; or between two axes strongly
               capped with iron, horizontally placed, and
               turned contrary ways; and then pressed as
               <commodity>grapes</commodity> or <commodity>olives</commodity> are. The juice thus pressed
               out is boiled in three several cauldrons, one
               after another. In the third cauldron it be-
               comes thick and black, and is then put into
               conical pots, which at the bottom have a lit-
               tle hole stopped only with coarse and foul
               <commodity>sugar</commodity>. These pots are covered when full
               with a cake of paste, made of a kind of
               earth called the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> <foreign xml:lang="sp">gritty</foreign>, and found near
               <placeName>Olives</placeName>, which is good to take spots out of 
               clothes, which cap or cover sinks as the sugar
               sinks. These conical pots are put into other
               pots, into which, by the hole at the vertex, the
               juice drains down through the coarse <placeName>sugar</placeName> at
               the bottom. It drains for five or six months,
               in which time the <placeName>sugar</placeName> in the conical pots
       
        <pb n="018"/>
               grows hard, and white, all the juice being
               drunk up by the lute, or run out by the hole
               in the vertex. The juice is boiled again, so
               long as it is good for any thing; but at last it
               makes only a foul <commodity>red sugar</commodity>, that will never
               be better. The conical loaves of <commodity>sugar</commodity>, after
               they are taken out, are set to drain over the
               same pots for 14 or 15 days. To make the <commodity>sugar</commodity>
               more white, they must boil it again, but about
               one-sixth is lost every time. A pound of <commodity>sugar</commodity>
               of 12 ounces is sold at Olives for three <currency rend="slant(italic)">sous</currency> and
               an half; refined for five or six <currency rend="slant(italic)">sous</currency>. The <commodity>su-
               gar</commodity> juice is strained through strainers of <commodity>linen</commodity>,
               and is put out of one cauldron into another.
               They take it out of the first and second caul-
               drons so soon as it begins to boil; but in the
               third cauldron they let it boil till the scum
               rises, and then take off only the scum with the
               scummer, and put it into a long trough, to
               cool; and, when it is cool, put it into the co-
               nical pots. One scum rises after another in the 
               third cauldron. The scum, when it is taken
               off, is white, but turns to a black liquor in the
               trough. They never refine the <commodity>sugar</commodity> more
               than three or four times. They use for the re-
               fining of it whites of eggs, putting in two or
               three dozen into a cauldron. They use but one
               cauldron for refining. When it is refined, it
          
     <pb n="019"/>
               grows hard and white in nine or ten days.
               When they refine it, they put a little water
               into the cauldron, to dissolve it the better.</quote>

               carried in the beginning of the 15th century,

               the commerce arising from the <commodity>sugar</commodity> there pro-

               though known to the antients, yet after the

               elapsed in which all intercourse, mention,
               and even knowledge of them, were buried in
               oblivion; and they remained as sunk from the
               world until about the year 1330, when a 
               <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> vessel was forced on one of them in a
               violent gale of wind. After this accident they
