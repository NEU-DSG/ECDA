            <p>I have undertaken a difficult task, in at-
               tempting to give an History of <ecda:commodity rend="smallcaps">Sugar</ecda:commodity>.
            </p>
            <p>Much time has elapsed since the cultivation 
               of the sugar cane has been generally known,
               and <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> in almost general use. Yet no per-
               son hitherto has connected any regular series
               of facts on the subject; a subject of the first 
               importance in commerce: and, more than 
               that, a subject now influencing the dispositions
               to health or disease, of the greater part of the
               inhabitants of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>The materials which present themselves for
               my purpose, are disjointed and contradictory.
               The rays, which scarcely illumine the surface
               of the mass I am to penetrate, are feeble and 
               confused. To discover a foundation, on which 
               order and arrangement may rise, I must toil
               through trackless regions of obscurity.
           </p>
           <p>The most ancient author, who mentions the

               with a valley, which is terminated by the steep

               Sacred, or Holy Tree. Its leaves constantly

               the best are at <placeName>Olives</placeName>. By the way we saw the
               <ecda:commodity>sugar canes</ecda:commodity> growing in several places. They
               are planted in low wet grounds, well mucked
               and dressed, divided into beds or hillocks, and
               furrows. They cut the <ecda:flora>canes</ecda:flora> close to the roots
               in November and December, and, cutting off 
               the slender tops, which afford no good juice,
               keep them under ground till March, and then
               prick them into these hillocks or beds; out of

               <ecda:flora>canes</ecda:flora>, which will be ripe next December.
               The knots, or joints of the <ecda:flora>cane</ecda:flora> at the bot-
               tom are very close together, scarce an inch
               asunder; but upwards the distance is more, as

               the <ecda:commodity>cane</ecda:commodity> grows slenderer. Within is a white
               pulp, or pith, full of sap sweet as honey.
               They sell them at <placeName>Gandia</placeName> to eat, and, cutting
               them in pieces just in the middle between two
               knots, suck the pieces at both ends. To make
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, after the <ecda:flora>canes</ecda:flora> are cleansed from the 
               tops and leaves, and cut to pieces, they are
               first bruised, either with a perpendicular stone
               running round, as <ecda:flora>apples</ecda:flora> to make <ecda:commodity>cyder</ecda:commodity>, or
               <ecda:flora>olives</ecda:flora> to make <ecda:commodity>oil</ecda:commodity>; or between two axes strongly
               capped with iron, horizontally placed, and
               turned contrary ways; and then pressed as
               <ecda:food>grapes</ecda:food> or <ecda:food>olives</ecda:food> are. The juice thus pressed
               out is boiled in three several cauldrons, one
               after another. In the third cauldron it be-
               comes thick and black, and is then put into
               conical pots, which at the bottom have a lit-
               tle hole stopped only with coarse and foul
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>. These pots are covered when full
               with a cake of paste, made of a kind of
               earth called the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> <distinct type="dialect" xml:lang="es" rend="italic">gritty</distinct>, and found near
               <placeName>Olives</placeName>, which is good to take spots out of 
               clothes, which cap or cover sinks as the sugar
               sinks. These conical pots are put into other
               pots, into which, by the hole at the vertex, the
               juice drains down through the coarse sugar at
               the bottom. It drains for five or six months,
               in which time the <ecda:commodity ana="#production">sugar</ecda:commodity> in the conical pots

               grows hard, and white, all the juice being
               drunk up by the lute, or run out by the hole
               in the vertex. The juice is boiled again, so
               long as it is good for any thing; but at last it
               makes only a foul red sugar, that will never
               be better. The conical loaves of sugar, after
               they are taken out, are set to drain over the
               same pots for 14 or 15 days. To make the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               more white, they must boil it again, but about
               one-sixth is lost every time. A pound of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               of 12 ounces is sold at <placeName>Olives</placeName> for three <distinct type="economic" rend="italic">sous</distinct> and
               an half; refined for five or six <distinct type="economic" rend="italic">sous</distinct>. The <ecda:commodity>su-
               gar</ecda:commodity> juice is strained through strainers of <ecda:commodity>linen</ecda:commodity>,
               and is put out of one cauldron into another.
               They take it out of the first and second caul-
               drons so soon as it begins to boil; but in the
               third cauldron they let it boil till the scum
               rises, and then take off only the scum with the
               scummer, and put it into a long trough, to
               cool; and, when it is cool, put it into the co-
               nical pots. One scum rises after another in the 
               third cauldron. The scum, when it is taken
               off, is white, but turns to a black liquor in the
               trough. They never refine the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> more
               than three or four times. They use for the re-
               fining of it whites of eggs, putting in two or
               three dozen into a cauldron. They use but one
               cauldron for refining. When it is refined, it

               grows hard and white in nine or ten days.
               When they refine it, they put a little water

            <p>The island of <placeName>Madeira</placeName> is supposed, like the

            <p>From the incorrect accounts of the first

               ascertain in which of the islands the cane was
               found, an in which it was not. We know it
               was seen in some of them: but, from modern
               navigators, we have proofs that it grows
               spontaneously in all the islands in the <placeName>South Sea</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>It was found in great abundance in all the

               the purposes of making sugar, was introduced;
               which before was either entirely neglected, or
               the use of simple juice only known: and
               frequently mention is made when sugar was

               nonplusses in the work. And-so returning
               with more plants, and better knowlege, they
               went on upon fresh hopes, but still short of
               what they should be more skilful in; for, at
               our first arrival, we found them ignorant in
               three main points that much conduced to the
               work; <abbr rend="italics">viz.</abbr> the manner of planting; the time
               of gathering; and the right placing their coppers
               in their furnaces; as also the true way of
               covering their rollers with plates or bars of
               iron. At the time of our arrival there we
               found many sugar works set up, and at work:
               but yet the sugars they made were but bare
               <ecda:commodity>Muscovadoes</ecda:commodity>; and few of them merchantable
               commodities; so moist, and full of molasses,
               and so ill cured, as they were hardly worth
               bringing home to <placeName>England</placeName>. But about the
               time I left the Island, which was in <date when="1650">1650</date>, they
               were much bettered; for when they had skill
               to know when the canes were ripe, which was
               not till they were fifteen months old; and
               before they gathered them at twelve, which
               was a main disadvantage to the making good
               sugar; for, the liquor wanting of the sweetness
               
               <pb/>
               <fw type="pageNum">40</fw>
               
               it ought to have caused the sugars to be
               lean,and unfit to keep. Besides, they had
               grown greater proficients both in boiling and
               curing them, and had learnt the knowledge of
               making them white, such as you call lump-
               sugars here in <placeName>England</placeName>; but not so excellent
               as those they make in <placeName>Brazil</placeName>; nor is there any
               likelihood they can ever make such; the land
               there being better, and lying in a continent,
               must needs have constanter and steadier weather,
               and the air much drier and purer than
               it can be in so small an island as that of
               <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>.</quote>

                  was the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">tabaxir</distinct> of the <name>Arabians</name>; but
                  that the <name>Arabians</name> were ignorant how it was
                  produced, as were the ancient <name>Greeks</name> of the <distinct type="dialect" xml:lang="la" rend="italic">generatio
                  Mellis Calamini, sive <distinct type="dialect" xml:lang="el" rend="upright">σακχαρον</distinct></distinct>; who thought 
                  it was the dew, which, falling on the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> 
                  canes, concreted: and that it was a kind of 
                  manna.
               </p>
               <p>The <name>Arabians</name>, he observes, supposed the
                  <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">tabaxir</distinct> to be the ashes of the cane; and
                  certainly, he says, this species of sugar, when
                  concreted and coagulated, is like ashes; but,
                  when issuing from the joinings of the cane, it is 
                  white like starch. The antients remark also,
                  that their <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food> was brittle between the teeth;
                  therefore many of them call it <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">Indian salt</distinct>;
                  whereas our <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food>, he says, melts in the mouth,
                  and is not brittle<anchor xml:id="a016" corresp="#n016"/>.
               </p>
               <p>He contends that the <name>Arabians</name> were in an
                  error respecting their <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">tabaxir</distinct>; and that it was
                  not the ashes of the cane, but the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">sacar-mambu</distinct>

                  the <name>Greeks</name>. He says the antients gave it the
                  appellation of sugar, which the <name>Arabians</name> did
                  not; because they believed it to be the ashes,
                  and not a species of sugar which was called
                  by them <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">zuchar</distinct>.
               </p>
               <p>He says the cane, from which the fictitious 
                  sugar now in use is made, is a small plant;
                  but that in the <placeName>Indies</placeName>, which yields the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">sachar-

                  <name>Arabians</name>, or native sugar of the antients, is a
                  large tree; and that this species of sugar is the
                  concreted exudation from the tree, found about 
                  the joints.

               <p>I think it is evident, from the authors above 
                  cited, that, supposing the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">sacar mambu</distinct> if the
                  <name>Indians</name> were the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">tabaxir</distinct> of the <name>Arabians</name>, it is
                  impossible it could be the saccharum of the
                  ancients.
               </p>
               <p>It is also unnecessary to contend that the
                  <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">sacar mambu</distinct> of the <name>Indians</name> was not the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">tabaxir</distinct>
                  of the <name>Arabians</name>; for it appears to me that
                  neither <persName ref="#garcia_de_orta_1501">Garcias</persName>, nor his follower <persName ref="#willem_piso_1611">Piso</persName>, were
                  positive, from their own knowledge, what the

               <p>It is certain that the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">sacar-mambu</distinct> is not
                  sweet, according to their account, and consequently
                  cannot have any relation to sugar:
                  and if it be the exuded gummous juice of the
                  mambu, or, as we call it the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">bambu-cane</distinct>, it
                  could not be sweet, for that tree contains no
                  saccharine juice. How then could this be the
                  sugar of the ancients?
               </p>
               <p>The <name>Arabians</name> had their <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">tabaxir</distinct> from <placeName>India</placeName>.
                  Their account of it is fabulous. Yet they all
                  agree that it was the ashes of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> cane:
                  and whether it was a kind of pot-ash, or any 
                  other saline preparation, from vegetable
                  excineration, we cannot determine from any
                  chemical or medical facts they have left us on
                  the subject. Certain it is, there is no <emph>sweetness</emph>
                  attributed to it, and consequently it could not
                  be sugar; and, as it was given internally, whatever
                  resemblance it might have to <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">spodium</distinct>, it has
                  no right to that interpretation, as the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">spodium</distinct>
                  of the <name>Greeks</name>, as already observed, was a metallic

               <p>It is evident <persName ref="#avicenna_0980">Avicenna</persName> erroneously supposed

                  writers, with their editors, translators, and

                  various text, interpretations, and conjectures,
                  that it is impossible to know exactly the precise
                  distinctions, intended by the original authors,
                  in their different appellations of <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">honey</distinct>, <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">manna</distinct>,

               <p>However, the <ecda:flora>sugar cane</ecda:flora> is unquestionably
                  a native plant of some parts of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>; and,
                  though the art of evaporating its juice for the
                  purpose of making a common coarse, or <ecda:commodity>muscovado
                  sugar</ecda:commodity>, was known long before <persName ref="#avicenna_0980">Avicenna's</persName>
                  time; yet I cannot suppose, a thousand 
                  years prior to his time, that the sugar of the
                  ancients, being sugar-candy, was made in <placeName>Arabia</placeName>;
                  especially as <persName ref="#avicenna_0980">Avicenna</persName> himself, if we admit
                  the <emph>salt</emph> he mentions to be the same, says
                  it was brought to <placeName>Arabia</placeName> from <placeName>India</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>Yet <persName ref="#pliny_0023">Pliny</persName>is very particular in observing
                  that the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> sugar was superior in quality to
                  the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs>; which shews that some of the
                  sugar known to the <name>Romans</name> in his time must
                  have been brought from <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, if not 
                  manufactured there.
               </p>
               <p>Besides, we know that there is no such thing
                  as sugar found on canes; and so far from the
                  juice of the cane issuing from the plant, and
                  concreting like the gummous or vegetable rezinous juices,
                  the plant decase on being wounded; and,

                  without being wounded, the juice never escapes 
                  from its stem.

               <p>Every kind of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> whatever is made by      <!-- this is interesting, but I have no way to mark it. -->
                  art. Native sugar never existed. Ignorant
                  people, even at this day, in our own part of 
                  the world, imagine that sugar is found, like
                  pith, inthe hollow of the canes; in the state
                  in which it is brought to <placeName>Europe</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>The crystalline appearance of sugar-candy,
                  and its fragility between the teeth, might 
                  naturally lead the ancient writers to give it the
                  appellation of <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">salt</distinct>; and, from its sweetness,
                  that of <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">honey <hi rend="upright">of the</hi> reed</distinct>; as honey was their
                  standard of sweetness.
               </p>
               <p>It was also very natural, for people who
                  knew nothing of the process of making sugar,
                  that they should consider it, being a vegetable
                  production, as a gum; and, like other gums,
                  to be the exudations of some plant, or tree,
                  concreted by the heat of the sun.
               </p>
               <p>There can be no doubt that the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
                  of the ancients, and that species of sugar described
                  by the <name>Arabians</name> as resembling salt, with
                  the sweetness of honey, were the same identical
                  article; and as in the writing of the ancients
                  there is only one sort of sugar mentioned,
                  and though that sugar is said by some
                  of them to have been brought from <placeName>Arabia</placeName>,

                  as well as from <placeName>India</placeName>, yet the <name>Arabians</name> themselves
                  mention it as brought from <placeName>India</placeName> only;
                  and there is every reason to believe, at that period,
                  that the art of chrystallizing the juice of
                  the cane was known only in <placeName>India</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, sugar must have been better known
                  in <placeName>Greece</placeName> and in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, from their contiguity
                  to <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, had it then been manufactured in
                  that country. Besides, there is no mention
                  among the antients of any kind of sweet canes
                  or reeds, but what were particularly said to
                  have grown in <placeName>India</placeName>.
               </p>
               <p>As it is certain that sugar was brought from
                  <placeName>India</placeName> at the time when mention was first made
                  of it, it is proper to enquire whether it was
                  manufactured in <placeName>India</placeName> only; and what sort of
                  sugar was made in <placeName>India</placeName> in those times; or at
                  least to draw the best inference we can from
                  what we know of the history of the commerce
                  of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, and the manufacture of it in the <placeName>East
                  Indies</placeName>, at this time.

               <p>There have ever beem, since our knowledge

               <p>The <name>Chinese</name>, and all the nations of the

               <p>The profits arising from this concern were

                  broad leaves, and has sugar, which comes out
                  at the buds of the brances, and at the bottom
                  of the leaves; from whence it is collected:
                  in which sugar, there is a bitterness. The
                  tree bears a kind of apple, about the size of
                  an egg, which yields a corrosive liquor. It
                  produces a down, with which pillows and
                  bolsters are stuffed. The tree is called <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">chercha</distinct>.
                  when the leaves are cut, the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">haoscer</distinct> yields a

               <p>Sugar, analytically examined, demonstrates
                  phlegm, spirit, acid, and oil; and, by fermentation,
                  yields an ardent spirit.

               <p>Two pounds of refined <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> produce one
                  ounce and thirty-six grains of a limpid,
                  inodorous, insipid phlegm; twelve ounces and six
                  drams of a liquor at first limpid, then brownish
                  and empyreumatic, then acid, and then
                  urinous; and six drams of thin brownish oil.
               </p>
               <p>The black residuary mass in the retort
                  weighed eight ounces, two drams, and three
                  grains; which, calcined in a furnace for fifteen
                  hours, left one ounce, one dram, and ten
                  grains, of brown cinders; from which two
                  drams and forty grains of a fixed alcali salt 
                  were obtained by lixivium.
               </p>
               <p>In the distillation, there was a loss of eight
                  ounces and six drams; in the calcination,
                  seven ounces, and fifty three grains.
               </p>
               <p>Sugar is an essential salt, consisting of an 
                  acid salt, oil, and earth. It shews no signs of
                  acid or alcali. It takes flame, and brurns
                  brightly. It dissolves easily in acqueous menstrua,
                  but not in spiritous or oily. Dissolved 
                  in water, it undergoes fermentation, and
                  acquires first a vinous, then an acetous flavour.
               </p>
               <p>If one pound of <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food> be dissolved in six
                  or eight pints of water, and a spoonful of the

                  yeast of <ecda:food>beer</ecda:food> be added to it, and well mixed,
                  and exposed to gentle heat, in a vessel properly
                  closed, but the vessel must not be full, in a few
                  hours it will begin to ferment with great
                  vehemence; and in three or four weeks, more or
                  less, according to the quantity of liquor, and
                  warmth of the situation where it is placed, it
                  will produce a strong vinous liquor, not unlike
                  honey and water. This liquor distilled yields
                  a strong ardent spirit. If the whole fermeting
                  materials be exposed longer to a continued
                  heat, a strong vinegar, like that of wine, will
                  be produced; by the liquor changing from its
                  vinous to its acetous state.

               <p>Among more recent chemical investigation,
                  and in the higher elementary brances of
                  chemical science, discoveries have been made
                  important to arts and manufactories; and also

                  <p>Sugar being justly considered as an
                  essential salt, it will readily be granted, that it 
                  contains an acid; this acid may be separated, and

                  exhibited in a crystalline form, by the following
                  process:—
               </p>
               <p><label>A</label> Let one ounce of the purest sugar, in
                  powder, be mixed, in a tubulated retort, with
                  three ounces of strong nitrous acid, whose specific
                  gravity is nearly 1,567
               </p>
               <p><label>B</label> When the solution is completed, and
                  the most phlogisticated part of the nitrous
                  acid has flown off, let a receiver be luted on,
                  and the solution gently boiled. In this process
                  and immense quantity of nitrous air is discharged<anchor xml:id="a030" corresp="#n030"/>.
               </p>
               <p><label>C</label> When the liquor acquires a dark-
                  brown colour, let three ounces more of nitrous
                  acid be poured on, and the boiling continued
                  until the coloured and smoking acid has entirely
                  disappeared.
               </p>
               <p><label>D</label> Let the liquor in the receiver be then
                  poured into a larger vessel; and, upon cooling,
                  small quadrilateral prismatic crystals are
                  found adhering together, at an angle generally
                  of about 45 degrees: these collected and dried
                  on a bibulous paper, weigh 109 grains.

               <p><label>E</label> The remaining lixivium, boiled again

                  acid, until the red vapours begin to disappear,
                  upon cooing, as before, affords 43 grains of
                  saline aciculæ.
               </p>
               <p><label>F</label> If to the viscid glutinous liquor which
                  remains, there be added, at different times,
                  small quantities of nitrous acid, amounting in
                  all to two ounces, by boiling and evaporating
                  to dryness, a saline mass is at length formed,
                  brown, glutinous, and deliquescent, which,
                  when perfectly dried, weights half a drachm;
                  but in depuration nearly half of this weight is
                  lost.
               </p>
               <p><label>G</label> The crystals obtained in the manner
                  above described, are to be depurated by 
                  repeated solution and crystallization; and operation
                  which is particularly necessary to the portion
                  got, as described in (F).
               </p>
               <p>The last lixivium (F), digested with nitrous
                  acid, and evaporated to dryings by the sun's 
                  heat, exhibits prisms similar to those mentioned,
                  (D) and (E); so that this affords a method
                  of abridging the number of depurations.
               </p>
               <p><label>H</label> To obtain, therefor, one part of 
                  this salt, there ar required 3 of sugar, and 30
                  of nitrous acid. Thus it may be reckoned
                  among the most expensive slats hitherto
                  known.

               <p>It must be particularly observed, that a
                  much smaller quantity of crystals will be
                  obtained, if the boiling be continued ever so
                  little beyond the proper time.
               </p>
                  <p><label>I</label> The acid thus obtained I call <distinct type="scientific" rend="italic">acid of
                  sugar</distinct>; not because it is procurable from that
                  substance only, but because sugar affords it
                  more pure, and in greater quantity, than any
                  other matter hitherto tried.
               </p>
               <p>Thus 100 parts of gum arabic, treated as
                  above, with 900 of nitrous acid, at the beginning
                  of the boiling foam violently, and, upon
                  cooling, yield scarce more than 21 of saccharine
                  acid, prismaticallly crystallized; but at
                  the same time the solution, even to the last,
                  separates a saccharated lime, which, when
                  collected, weighs 11, and containts about 5 of the
                  acid of sugar: 8 parts of highly-rectified spirit
                  of wine, with 24 of nitrous acid, yield 3 of a 
                  saccharine acid, but, for the most part, in a
                  squamous form, and loaded with much mosture;
                  besides, honey, and whatever substance
                  contains sugar, in the same way, produces the
                  same acid; although acid of tartar, dissolved 
                  and boiled in nitrous acid, in the same
                  manner, yields a salt somewhat similar to this,
                  both in taste and squamous crystallization, yet
                  it is of a whiter colour; and, besides, is unchangeable

                  in the fire, yielding only a coal as
                  before.
               </p>
               <p>In another dissertation it will be shewn that
                  the acid of sugar occurs also in animal substances.
               </p>
               <p>This salt possesses many properties; some
                  peculiar to itself, some common to it with
                  other acids, though differing more or less in
                  degree: and these we are now to consider.
               </p>
               <p><label>A</label> The crystals have an exceeding
                  pungent taste; but a solution of these, when 
                  sufficiently diluted, excites a very agreeable
                  sensation on the tongue. Twenty grains 
                  communicate a sensible acidity to a quart of
                  water.
               </p>
               <p><label>B</label> It makes red all the blue vegetable
                  juices, except that of indigo. A single grain
                  dissolved in four ounces of water instantly
                  makes red the blue paper for covering sugar-
                  loaves; which is not affected by the weaker
                  acids: and twelve grains, dissolved in a quart
                  of water, produce the same effect upon paper
                  tinged with turnsole.
               </p>
               <p><label>C</label> It attacks alkalis, earths, and sundry
                  metals; and dissolves them with effervescence,
                  if they be united with aërial acid. These 
                  combinations serve to distinguish this evidently
                  from all other acids.

                     <p>Eighty-two parts of saccharine acid take
                        up 100 of pellucid calcareous spar, but not
                        immediately; because the surface, when saturated
                        with acid, prevents the access of the
                        acid to the internal nucleus. Nitrated lime is
                        completely precipitated by acid of sugar, in
                        the form of a white powder, not soluble in
                        water.
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the 119 parts, by weight, of this powder, 72
                        fall to the bottom, and 47 appear upon evaporation:
                        hence it is shewn that 100 parts
                        contain, of acid 48, of pure lime 46, and of
                        water 6; so that not only the presence of lime
                        in water is discovered by acid of sugar, but
                        even its quantity may, without difficulty, be
                        ascertained,
                     </p>
                     <p>The saccharine acid attacks lime with such
                        force that it separates it from every other: this
                        combination, therefore, cannot be decomposed
                        by any acid, alkali, or earth, hitherto known,
                        and can only be decomposed by fire.
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence also we understand the necessity of
                        lime-water in the purification of sugar; for,

                        the juice of the cane contains a superabundance
                        of acid, which prevents the dry concretion;
                        and even if to pure sugar dissolved in water, be
                        added the saccharine acid, it will not form
                        crystalline grains.
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, nothing more powerfully attracts
                        this acid than lime; and, when united with it,
                        it is insoluble, and either falls to the bottom, or
                        floats in the scum. Lime-water, therefore,
                        affords the most complete means of effecting
                        the crystallization; as it removes the impediment,
                        and besides, may easily be added in any 
                        proportion, without communicating any
                        heterogeneous matter.
                     </p>
                     <p>Many persons have thought that a portion
                        of the lime remains mixed with the sugar;
                        but, if the purification be properly conducted,
                        the nature of the ingredients, the circumstances
                        of the operation, and, finally, the most accurate
                        analysis, abundantly shew, that there is
                        not the smallest trace of lime remaining.
                     </p>
                     <p>Good sugar dissolves totally in distilled
                        water; which could not possibly be the case if
                        there were present any lime, either crude or

                     <p><anchor xml:id="a032" corresp="#n032"/>The vegetable alkali does indeed absorb
                        the acid of sugar, but forms with it a salt not
                        very difficult of solution; and, besides, a caustic
                        lixivion, if used in too great a quantity, will
                        dissolve a portion of the sugar. In saccharated
                        lime, the earthy basis predominates: for,
                        when boiled with syrup of violets, it strikes a
                        green colour.

                     <p>If we consider the nature of the acid of
                        sugar, we find that it does not resemble 
                        the nitrous acid in any other instance than 
                        those properties which are common to all
                        acids; besides, it expels the nitrous acids from
                        lime, terra ponderosa, magnesia, and metals;
                        yielding to the other acids nothing but alkalis;
                        while the nitrous acid produces salt, either
                        deliquescent or easily soluble, acid of sugar yields
                        such as are scarcely soluble in water.
                     </p>
                     <p>Alkalis, when nitrated, detonate with
                        ignited phlogiston; but, when saccharated, shew
                        not the least signs of deflagration, which they
                        evidently do upon the addition of the smallest 
                        particle of nitrous.

                     <p>The nitrous acid corrodes tin and antimoney,

                        nitrous acid, united with vegetabe fixed
                        alkali, deliquesces, does not form crystals, and
                        is readily expelled by vinegar, or even by acid
                        of sugar, still more loaded with phlogiston:
                        all which circumstances by no means take 
                        place with respect to the fixed vegetable alkali
                        united with acid of sugar.
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other dissimilarities will occur upon
                        comparison; so that these acids are of a nature
                        not only unlike, but in many instances diametrically
                        opposite.
                     </p>
                     <p>If any will attribute all the difference to
                        phlogiston, I will not deny that that subtile
                        principle forms a wonderful source of difference;
                        but the difference which takes place 
                        here can by no means be attributed to this,
                        when properly examined.
                     </p>
                     <p>The nitrous acid is weakened, and made far
                        more volatile, by union with the phligiston;
                        the acid of sugar much more fixed, even when
                        loaded with os great a quantity as to be 
                        crystallizable; it almost every where expels the
                        strongest nitrous acid, as experiments shew;
                        besides, the phlogisticated nitrous acid produces,
                        with the very same matter, compounds
                        totally different from those with acid of sugar.
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be judged from circumstances

                        which are unknown, forged, or, at best,
                        possible: and among all the facts yet known,
                        concerning the acid of sugar, we can find
                        no signs of its being derived from the nitrous 
                        acid.
                     </p>
                     <p>However, let us enquire more deeply; let
                        us principally consult nature, not indifferently
                        and slightly, supplying the deficiencies with
                        fiction, but candidly and properly, by apt and
                        accurate experiments; otherwise her answers,
                        like those of the oracles of old, will be either
                        delusive or ambiguous.

                     <p>But, by whatever means the acid of sugar is
                        produced, it must be considered as distinct,
                        and different from all others, being always 
                        essentially and specifically the same. Its singular
                        properties, some of which are of considerable
                        use in chemistry, shew that it deserves the most

                  <p>Sugar consists of a peculiar acid united to

                     matter. It crystallizes in hexahedral
                     truncated prisms; and in this state is called sugar-
                     candy. By distillation it affords and acid 
                     phlegm, and a few drops of empyreumatic
                     oil. The residue is a spungy light coal, which
                     contains a small quantity of vegetable alkali.
                     This salt is inflammable. On hot coals it
                     melts, and swells up very much, emits a 
                     penetrating vapour, and becomes converted into a
                     brown yellow matter. It is very soluble in
                     water, to which it gives much consistence,
                     and constitutes a kind of mucilage, called
                     syrup. Syrup diluted with water is capable
                     of fermentation, and affords ardent spirit.

                     and that consequently the same saccharine

                     made in this view upon the <ecda:flora><rs type="properAdjective">Swedish</rs> maple</ecda:flora>.
                     Eight trees, non of them under thirty years,
                     bled, in four days, fourteen gallons of juice,
                     which inspissated gave two pounds and a half

                     half, which yielded one pound four ounces of

                     inspissated, a sweet saline concrete, not
                     however perfectly of the saccharine kind; but

                  latitudes within, and, and near the torrid zone, arrives
                  at excellence only in the hottest climate. But
                  much rain, or water, as well as sun, is necessary

                  general productions of the earth; and how
                  little is collected from the wide range of 
                  flowers, by the consummate skill of the laborious
                  bee; or from roots, trees, fruit, and grain, by

               <p>The proportion of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> to the cane juice

                  consider a pound of sugar from a gallon of cane
                  juice, as good yielding; and that an acre of
                  land, giving three hogsheads of sugar of 14
                  cwt. each, as ample produce. But for this
                  quantity the soil must be good, and the canes
                  of the first year's cutting, and in perfection.

               <p>That sugar is nutritious in the most eminent
                  degree has been long known. It is the basis
                  of all vegetable nutrition.
               </p>
               <p>Every root and earthly production is 
                  nutritious, in proportion to the saccharine principle
                  it contains. Nothing nourishes that is entirely
                  free from this saccharine principle; otherwise,
                  turnips would be as little nitritive as <ecda:food ana="#flora">cucumbers</ecda:food>,
                  being, like them, the sugar excepted,
                  scarcely any thing but water.
               </p>
               <p><ecda:food>Milk</ecda:food> is nutritious on the same account; and
                  that milk is most nutritous which most abounds
                  with saccharine sweetness; and when milk is
                  defective in this quality, from bad pasturage
                  and other causes, our vegetable sugar should
                  be added to it, to remedy such defect.
               </p>
               <p>In all cases sugar helps the assimilation of
                  milk in the stomach; and not only prevents 
                  its curdling, and disordering that organ, but
                  corrects the tendency which milk has to injure
                  the breath, by adhering to the teeth and
                  gums, and rendering them foul and offensive.
               </p>
               <p>As <ecda:food>milk</ecda:food> has this property, and is much
                  used in schools, and constitutes great part of
                  the sustenance of most young people, a toothbrush
                  and water should always be employed;
                  or at least the mouth should be well rinced
                  with water, after a meal made of milk.

               <p>No modern physicians have noticed this;
                  but the ancients were well acquainted with the
                  injurious effects of milk, on the teeth and 
                  gums<anchor xml:id="a055" corresp="#n055"/>.

               <p>In regard to sugar being prejudicial to the
                  teeth, this has long been known as a prudent
                  old woman's bug-bear, to frighten children;
                  that they might not follow their natural
                  inclination, by seizing opportunities, when they 
                  are not watched, of devouring all the sugar 
                  they can find.
               </p>
               <p>This story has had a good effect among the
                  common people in Scotland. They are impressed 
                  with a notion that <soCalled rend="italic">sweeties</soCalled> hurt the
                  teeth; therefore they live contented without

               <p>When milk is not the sole diet of children
                  at their mother's breast, sugar, in various 
                  mixtures and vehicles, makes the chief portion,
                  essentially, of their support.

               <p><ecda:commodity>Sugar</ecda:commodity> does not create worms in children,
                  as has been often said: on the contrary, it
                  destroys worms. Some writers have mentioned
                  this<anchor xml:id="a056" corresp="#n056"/>; but my authority is my own observation.
               </p>
               <p>In the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, the negro children, from
                  crudes vegetable diet, are much afflicted with
                  worms. In crop-time, when the canes are
                  ripe, these children are always sucking them.
                  Give a negro infant a piece of sugar cane to
                  suck, and the impoverished milk of his mother
                  is tasteless to him. This salubrious luxury
                  soon changes his appearance. Worms are 
                  discharged; his enlarged belly and joints
                  diminish; his emaciated limbs increase; and, if
                  canes were always ripe, he would never be
                  diseased.

                  unaccustomed to it; and sometimes it operates as
                  an active purgative, and disorders the bowels.
                  This happens frequently to <name>Europeans</name>, who
                  arrive in the sugar countries just at crop-time.

                  to honey, and in process of time almost entirely

                  been in use among mankind, coeval with

               <p>The superiority of sugar would soon be

                  emetic, or cathartic, or as both. In others,
                  honey will cause erysipelas, nettle rash,

                  after vomiting of blood, and convulsions.
               </p>
               <p>The cause of what is considered as the poison
                  of muscles, is generally supposed to arise
                  from some malignant quality inherent in the 
                  fish itself; according to the place where it is
                  found, and particular seasons. Some suppose
                  the poison consists in a kind of <distinct type="scientific" rend="italic">stella marina</distinct>, a
                  sea insect, frequently found in <ecda:food>muscles</ecda:food>; whose 
                  spawn is very corrosive, and when applied to
                  the skin excoriates it.
               </p>
               <p>But the real cause is, in the indigestible 
                  property of a part of the <ecda:food>muscle</ecda:food>, which should
                  never be eaten; and without which, muscles
                  are innocent and nutritive.
               </p>
               <p>The noxious part of the <ecda:food>muscles</ecda:food> is in the hard
                  threads, or wiry filaments, by which they fasten
                  themselves to one another; to the bottom of
                  ships; and to rocks, and stones; and, as if
                  anchored by the strongest cable, no waves nor
                  current can break their hold.
               </p>
               <p>These filaments issue from an hard cartilaginous
                  sobstance, at the root of what is commonly
                  caled the tongue of the muscle, in the
                  middle of its body.

               <p>That <ecda:food ana="#poison">honey</ecda:food> should sometimes produce the
                  ill effects I have mentioned cannot create

                  depends on the quality of his materials.
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is that honey in different countries
                  divvers so much in flavour, and consequently in
                  wholesomeness.

                  origin. And I verily believe, that their 
                  melancholy officers of health; avoiding what they
                  call infected persons; and putting marks on
                  the doors and windows of an house where
                  any person is ill, and similar acts of charitable

                  and good intention, only tend to frighten the
                  people; and dishearten them, at a time they
                  stand most in need of fortitude.

                  marshes, by cutting down the woods, which
                  kept their foul vapours from being rarified by
                  the sun, and borne away by the winds, produced 
                  great pestilence in <placeName>Italy</placeName>.

               <p>The idea also of the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> plague being
                  imported from <placeName rend="italic">Bulam</placeName>, or any other place, is
                  repugnant to reason. I was told a similar tale,
                  when I first went to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>: that the
                  <distinct type="scientific" rend="italic">Yellow Fever</distinct> there, was imported in the 
                  beginning of the century from <placeName rend="italic">Siam</placeName>. That it was
                  a contagious, and an original putrid disease;
                  and that bleeing was death. In my practice
                  I proved the reverse of all this.

               <p ana="#disease">The cause of pestilential epidemics, cannot
                  be confined, and local. It must lie in the 
                  atmosphere, which surrounds, and is in contact
                  with every part of us; and in which we are 
                  immersed, as bodies in fluids.
               </p>
               <p ana="#disease">These diseases not appearing in villages, and
                  thinly inhabited places, and generally attacking
                  only great towns and cities, may be, that
                  the atmosphere, which I conceive to be the
                  universal propagator of pestilence, wants a
                  commixture, or union, with some compaounded,

                  and peculiar air, such as is generated in 
                  popular communities,—to separate, or release its
                  imprisoned virulence, and give it force.
               </p>
               <p ana="#medical">The ancient writers on medicine, and indeed
                  all others, which I have read, assert, that the
                  operation, of whatever they assign to be the
                  cause of epidemical fevers,—is solely on the
                  blood and fluids. This may be doubted.
               </p>
               <p>The impressions of the atmosphere, on the 
                  surface of the body, when contained, or
                  deprived of vitality, like East winds, are as
                  perceptible, as the effects of approaching, or
                  retreating from, a fire.
               </p>
               <p>In the common order of pestilential fevers,
                  they commence with coldness, and shivering;
                  simply demonstrating, that something unusual
                  has been in contact with the skin, agonizing
                  cutanoeus sensibility.
               </p>
               <p>The skin is covered with the extremities of
                  fibres, nerves, and vessels;—these are in the
                  most exposed situation, with the least power
                  of resistng external injury.—Hence a destruction,
                  or a privation of their elasticity, and
                  restraining power, from a poisoned atmosphere.
                  —And hence I conceive that the first blow in
                  these fevers is made, on the solids;—the
                  strength of the whole frame is thus prostrated
                  in a moment, and every nerve and muscle
                  paralysed.
               </p>

               <p>Sickness at the stomach, and an immoveable
                  pressure about the præcordia follow. These
                  demonstrate, that the blood cannot pervade
                  the extremities of the body, and that the
                  quantity which ought to dilate through the
                  whole machine, is confined to the larger
                  organs, and is crowding, and distending the
                  heart, and central vessels.
               </p>
               <p>The restraining power of the remoter blood
                  vessels being destroyed, the thinner parts of the
                  blood escape their boundaries; hence arises
                  yellowness in the skin, in some climates:—in
                  others, the grosser parts of the blood stagnate,
                  forming black lodgements, bubo, anthrax, and
                  exanthemata.
               </p>
               <p>The object in these fevers, is to decide the
                  contest between the solids and the fluids; and
                  this appears to me, to be the only practicable,
                  by draining the vital parts, by bleeding and
                  purging, before the fluids have burst their
                  confines, and dissolved their bond of union
                  with the solids.—The next step is to regain
                  the lost energy of the sruface of the body,
                  by exciting perspiration; and then of the
                  whole system, by tonics.
               </p>
               <p>When these things are not done in the first
                  hours of attack, in pestilential fevers, and
                  the conflict is not <emph>extinguished</emph> at once,—bark,

                  undertakers,—to perform an useless ceremony.

                  contagion in pestilential diseases, are contrary

                  they should give diseases to others, which
