            <p>Much time has elapsed since the cultivation

               and <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> in almost general use. Yet no per-
               son hitherto has connected any regular series
               of facts on the subject; a subject of the first 
               importance in commerce: and, more than 
               that, a subject now influencing the dispositions
               to health or disease, of the greater part of the
               inhabitants of the earth.

            <p>The materials which present themselves for
               my purpose, are disjointed and contradictory.
               The rays, which scarcely illumine the surface
               of the mass I am to penetrate, are feeble and 
               confused. To discover a foundation, on which 
               order and arrangement may rise, I must toil
               through trackless regions of obscurity.

               with a valley, which is terminated by the steep

            <p><quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">I went to <placeName>Olives</placeName>, in <placeName>Valencia</placeName> also, where,
               and at <placeName>Gandia</placeName>, are the engines for <ecda:commodity>sugar-works</ecda:commodity>;
               the best are at <placeName>Olives</placeName>. By the way we saw the
               <ecda:commodity>sugar canes</ecda:commodity> growing in several places. They
               are planted in low wet grounds, well mucked
               and dressed, divided into beds or hillocks, and
               furrows. They cut the <ecda:commodity>canes</ecda:commodity> close to the roots
               in November and December, and, cutting off 
               the slender tops, which afford no good juice,
               keep them under ground till March, and then
               prick them into these hillocks or beds; out of
               every <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="slant(italic)">talea</foreign>, or cut, shoot four, five, or six,
               <ecda:commodity>canes</ecda:commodity>, which will be ripe next December.
               The knots, or joints of the <ecda:commodity>cane</ecda:commodity> at the bot-
               tom are very close together, scarce an inch
               asunder; but upwards the distance is more, as
             
      <pb n="017"/>
               the <ecda:commodity>cane</ecda:commodity> grows slenderer. Within is a white
               pulp, or pith, full of <ecda:commodity>sap</ecda:commodity> sweet as <ecda:commodity>honey</ecda:commodity>.
               They sell them at <placeName>Gandia</placeName> to eat, and, cutting
               them in pieces just in the middle between two
               knots, suck the pieces at both ends. To make
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, after the <ecda:commodity>canes</ecda:commodity> are cleansed from the 
               tops and leaves, and cut to pieces, they are
               first bruised, either with a perpendicular stone
               running round, as <ecda:commodity>apples</ecda:commodity> to make <ecda:commodity>cyder</ecda:commodity>, or
               <ecda:commodity>olives</ecda:commodity> to make <ecda:commodity>oil</ecda:commodity>; or between two axes strongly
               capped with iron, horizontally placed, and
               turned contrary ways; and then pressed as
               <ecda:commodity>grapes</ecda:commodity> or <ecda:commodity>olives</ecda:commodity> are. The juice thus pressed
               out is boiled in three several cauldrons, one
               after another. In the third cauldron it be-
               comes thick and black, and is then put into
               conical pots, which at the bottom have a lit-
               tle hole stopped only with coarse and foul
               <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>. These pots are covered when full
               with a cake of paste, made of a kind of
               earth called the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> <foreign xml:lang="sp">gritty</foreign>, and found near
               <placeName>Olives</placeName>, which is good to take spots out of 
               clothes, which cap or cover sinks as the sugar
               sinks. These conical pots are put into other
               pots, into which, by the hole at the vertex, the
               juice drains down through the coarse <placeName>sugar</placeName> at
               the bottom. It drains for five or six months,
               in which time the <placeName>sugar</placeName> in the conical pots
       
        <pb n="018"/>
               grows hard, and white, all the juice being
               drunk up by the lute, or run out by the hole
               in the vertex. The juice is boiled again, so
               long as it is good for any thing; but at last it
               makes only a foul <ecda:commodity>red sugar</ecda:commodity>, that will never
               be better. The conical loaves of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, after
               they are taken out, are set to drain over the
               same pots for 14 or 15 days. To make the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               more white, they must boil it again, but about
               one-sixth is lost every time. A pound of <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>
               of 12 ounces is sold at Olives for three <measure rend="slant(italic)">sous</measure> and
               an half; refined for five or six <measure rend="slant(italic)">sous</measure>. The <ecda:commodity>su-
               gar</ecda:commodity> juice is strained through strainers of <ecda:commodity>linen</ecda:commodity>,
               and is put out of one cauldron into another.
               They take it out of the first and second caul-
               drons so soon as it begins to boil; but in the
               third cauldron they let it boil till the scum
               rises, and then take off only the scum with the
               scummer, and put it into a long trough, to
               cool; and, when it is cool, put it into the co-
               nical pots. One scum rises after another in the 
               third cauldron. The scum, when it is taken
               off, is white, but turns to a black liquor in the
               trough. They never refine the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> more
               than three or four times. They use for the re-
               fining of it whites of eggs, putting in two or
               three dozen into a cauldron. They use but one
               cauldron for refining. When it is refined, it
          
     <pb n="019"/>
               grows hard and white in nine or ten days.
               When they refine it, they put a little water
               into the cauldron, to dissolve it the better.</quote>

               the commerce arising from the <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity> there pro-

               the art of making <ecda:commodity>sugar</ecda:commodity>, were extended by 
               different nations of <name>Europeans</name> to the <placeName>West In-

               elapsed in which all intercourse, mention,
               and even knowledge of them, were buried in
               oblivion; and they remained as sunk from the
               world until about the year 1330, when a 
               <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> vessel was forced on one of them in a
               violent gale of wind. After this accident they
               became known again in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.

            <p>The conquest of these islands was underta-
               ken by the <name>Spaniards</name> in 1393. The <name>Portu-
               guese</name>indeed had made some slight attempts in 
               1334; but, being repulsed at <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Gomero</placeName> by the
               <name>natives</name>, they relinquished the enterprize.
            </p>
            <p>The first of these islands that was conquered
               was <placeName rend="italic">Lancerata</placeName> in <date when="1400">1400</date>; <placeName rend="italic">Fuerventura</placeName> was

            <p>The island of <placeName>Madeira</placeName> is supposed, like the
               <placeName>Canary islands</placeName>, to have been known to the
               antients; and, like them. to have been lost in
               the same interval of darkness, until the year
               1344; when an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> vessel was driven on
               this island by a storm. But this event was not
               succeeded by any intercourse with the island,
               and seems to have been forgotten as no notice
               was taken of it until <date when="1419">1419</date>, when it was again
               discrovered by the <name>Portuguese</name>; who, in the
               following year, <date when="1420">1420</date>, took possession of it. It
               was then a mere wilderness, as its name imports,
               and unpeopled. The <name>Portuguese</name>
               burnt the woods, and made a settlement; and,
               in the same year, planted the sugar cane there,
               which they brought from the island of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.
            </p>
            <p>From the incorrect accounts of the first
               <rs type="properAdjective">West Indian</rs> discoveries, it is impossible to
               ascertain in which of the islands the cane was
               found, an in which it was not. We know it
               was seen in some of them: but, from modern
               navigators, we have proofs that it grows
               spontaneously in all the islands in the <placeName>South Sea</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>It was found in great abundance in all the 
               <placeName>Society islands</placeName>, <placeName>Easter island</placeName>, and the
               <placeName>Sandwich isles</placeName>; where the <rs type="persGroup">Indians</rs> are perfectly
               acquainted with the use of its expressed juice,
               but have know the knowledge of making sugar.
            </p>
            <p>Some plants of these canes have lately been
               introduced into the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and the
               astonishing increase of sugar, which those brought
               from <placeName>Otaheite</placeName> and planted in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> yield
               over those of the island, shews, if there be not
               different species,—that vegetables, as well as
               animals, may denegrate, and requires the
               impulse of change to incite or reanimate their
               vigour.

            <p>Thus the breed of cattle, and thus also the
               improved husbandry in <placeName>Europe</placeName> in general, are
               carried on; grain, seeds, and plants, are removed
               from place to place, and varied, and cultivated,
               on physical principles, by philosophers.

            <p>In <placeName>England</placeName>, the <persName>Duke of <placeName>Bedfort</placeName></persName>, and <persName>Mr.
               Coke</persName>, have distinguished themselves in this kind
               of knowledge; and have rendered the most essential
               services to their country.

            <p>This should be a lesson to the planter of
               The sugar cane, not to continue propagating
               from the same stock; or at least to try the
               effects, where any degenracy appears, of new
               plants from another island; or from the remote
               parts of the same island, where the former 
               cannot be obtained.

            <p>Whether there be different species of the
               sugar cane,or whether the varieties, with
               which we have been lately made aquainted,
               are owing to some local causes, has not yet
               been ascertained.
            </p>
            <p>The <name>French</name>, a few years since, introduced
               into their <rs type="properAdjective">West Indian</rs> islands plants from the
               <placeName>East Indies</placeName>. From their islands the cultivation
               of the <rs type="properAdjective">East Indian</rs> cane has been carried into
               some of the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> islands. <persName>Sir John Laforey</persName>
               planted them in <placeName>Antigua</placeName>, and has proved their
               present superiority over the old canes of the
               <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. He gives the following account
               of these canes:

            <quote rend="quotes">
               <p>One sort brought from the island of <placeName>Bourbon</placeName>,
                  reported by the <name>French</name> to be the growth
