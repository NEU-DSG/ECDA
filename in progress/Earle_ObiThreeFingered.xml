                    <p>I have published these letters, which accidentally fell into my hands, with a
                        view to commemorate the name of <persName>Jack</persName>, and place upon
                        the list of heroes, one who, had he shone in a higher sphere, would have
                        proved as bright a luminary as ever graced the Roman annals, or ever boldly
                        asserted the rights of a Briton. His cause was great and noble, for to
                        private wrongs he added the liberty of his countrymen, and stood alone a
                        bold and daring defender of the Rights of Man. To him who shall applaud Jack
                        through the varied scenes of his life; to him, whose heart shall sympathize
                        in his misfortunes, who shall smile upon his deeds, at the same time that he
                        laments their cause, I dedicate the following pages. W.E.J.</p>
