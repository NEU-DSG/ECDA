                <p>I have published these letters, which accidentally fell into my hands, with a
                    view to commemorate the name of <persName>Jack</persName>, and place upon the
                    list of heroes, one who, had he shone in a higher sphere, would have proved as
                    bright a luminary as ever graced the Roman annals, or ever boldly asserted the
                    rights of a Briton. His cause was great and noble, for to private wrongs he
                    added the liberty of his countrymen, and stood alone a bold and daring defender
                    of the Rights of Man. To him who shall applaud <persName>Jack</persName> through
                    the varied scenes of his life; to him, whose heart shall sympathize in his
                    misfortunes, who shall smile upon his deeds, at the same time that he laments
                    their cause, I dedicate the following pages. <persName>W.E.J</persName>.</p>

                <opener><salute>Dear <persName>Charles</persName></salute>,
                            <dateline><placeName>Jamaica</placeName></dateline>.</opener>
                <p>A whole week has your letter been lying open on my desk, ready for me to answer—a
                    whole week have the above two words been written, as you may perceive by the
                    difference in the shade of the ink and the cutting of my pen; for, three times
                    has the dried standish been replenished, and twenty times, at least, have I
                    dipped into it, sometimes with a new pen, sometimes with a mended one—and still
                    at this moment am I at a loss what to say to you in reply to your queries.</p>
                <p>Now, you will think that, because I have written the above long sentence, my mind
                    is wholly and exclusively engrossed by your business, and that I shall be able
                    to go on in a regular steady way; but I tell you, <persName>Charles</persName>,
                    it is no such thing; for at the end of that very sentence, I stopped a full
                    hour, unable to proceed—and now again do I stop short.</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>Try what I may, it will not do—but what is the matter? you will say.
                        <persName>Jack</persName>!!! and his cursed three fingers!!!</p>
                <p>I'll tell you what, <persName>Charles</persName>—I have just read your letter for
                    the hundred and first time, and upoin my soul, cannot see that the business it
                    is about is of such great importance; so, with or without your leave, I shall
                    put off answering it, until I have eased myself of my insufferable burthen, by
                    dispatching <persName>Jack</persName>, his three fingers, and his
                        <name>Obi</name>, and all that belongs to him; for, positively, I can think
                    of nothing else.</p>
                <p>And so it is with every body in the Island; go wherever I will the name of
                        <persName>Jack</persName> is perpetually buzzed in my ears. If I meet a
                    friend in the street, it is no longer "<said>How d'ye do</said>?" but
                        "<said>Well, what news of <persName>Jack</persName></said>?" if any of my
                    neighbors, calling his servant, says,; "<said><persName>Jack</persName>, come
                        here</said>," I start and stare about, in expectation of seeing the
                    threefingered one make his appearance. Nay, there is not a thing called
                        <persName>Jack</persName>, whether a smokejack, a boot jack, or any other
                    jack, but acts as a spell upon my senses and sets me on the fret at the bare
                    mention of it. By heavens! it is too much, and I wish...</p>
                <p>Nay, I do not—I cannot find in my heart to form the same wish that most of the
                    inhab—</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>itants here express every day. Jck is a noble fellow, and in spite of every cruel
                    hard hearted planter, I shall repeat the same to the last hour of my life.
                            "<said><persName>Jack</persName> is a Negro</said>," say they.
                            "<said><persName>Jack</persName> is a Man</said>," say I.</p>
                <p>—"<said>He is a slave</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Man cannot be a slave to Man</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>He is my property</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>How did you acquire that property</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>By paying for it</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Paying! Paying whom</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Him who brought him from Africa</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>How did he get possession of him</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>He caught him there</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Caught! what? Like a wild beast</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>No, but he contrived means to convey him into his ship</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Contrived! Then he brought him without his consent</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Very likely</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>And what has become of that robber</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Robber! He is a very respectable man, who has left off trade, has married
                        the daughter of a rich planter, and now lives very comfortably, after the
                        fatigues of an industrious life</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>What! Do they hang a poor hard-laboring man, who, driven by despair at
                        the sight of his numerous family ready to starve</said></p>
                <pb/>
                <p><said>for want of a bit of bread, takes advantage of a dark night, goes on the
                        highway and frightens teh traveller out of a few pieces of gold and shall a
                        daring ruffian, who is openly guilty of a crime more heinous in its nature
                        and baneful in its effects, get respected by every body and pass his days in
                        the peaceable enjoyment of riches acquired by such infamous
                    means</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>I don't understand you. I never heard that the traffic was infamous. Is
                        it not authorised by all the nations of Europe, Asia and America? Have not
                        regulations been made concerning it by all governments</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Very true, but that does not make it more honorable. Prostitution is
                        authorised, yes, for it is more than tolerated, by governments, many of
                        which have also made regulations concerning it, but that does make it less
                        infamous</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Nay, you are going too far, and this is widely different</said>.</p>
                <p>—"<said>Different !—By heavens ! you will drive me mad</said>."</p>

                <p>And such, my dear <persName>Charles</persName>, is the daily altercation I have
                    with the greatest part of the planters here, and what you have just read is a
                    specimen of the various arguments brought on both sides of the question. As I
                    know your sentiments upon the subject, I shall close</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>it here and proceed to my narrative about <persName>threefingered
                    Jack</persName>, and as I have made it my business to collect every particular
                    relative to him, I believe I shall have it in my power to give you a
                    circumstantial account of all his actions. In fact, what I am now going to write
                    is nothing more than a copy of what I had sometime ago begun to put into a
                    regular story, out of several memoranda collected at different times. So without
                    lengthening this preamble, I thus begin:</p>
                <ecda:embSN>
                    <p><persName>Amri</persName> was a beautiful slave, the property of
                            <persName>Mr. Mornton</persName>, of <placeName>Maroons
                        Town</placeName>. She was sanguinary in her temper; for, misfortunre, or
                        rather cruelty, had perverted a heart naturally inclined to virtue. She was
                        torn from the arms of her husband, her family and friends, while in the
                        mayday of her life, from her native <placeName>Africa</placeName></p>
                    <p>She had vowed to curse <rs type="persGroup">the European race</rs> for ever;
                        and had a son, in whose breast she never failed to nurture the baneful
                        passion of revenge</p>
                    <p>She taught him to despise his groaning companions, complaining under their
                        labor, meanly submitting to the christian whip, and then pusillanimously
                        venting their griefs in half suprressed sighs</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <p><persName>Jack</persName> had a soul, even in infancy, superior to such
                        whining; he complained not of the daily labor heaped upon him, but of the
                        tardiness of time.</p>
                    <p>Each night, when the grand luminator of the world hid his rays within the
                        deep, he threw himself on his knees, and prayed the great God of his country
                        to ripen him to manhood, that he might shake off the yoke that pressed heavy
                        upon him, and revenge the cause of his country and his parents. His youthful
                        fiery soul led him to imagine himself the destroyer of all
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName>; he saw in the warlike picture his fancy
                        drew, the course he was to fllow, and the transport of his heart was often
                        visible by the uncommon hauteur of his manners. When assured of revenge, he
                        would grin with a smile of malice, transparent on his cheek, at the
                        overseer, while the merciless whip was lacerating his back.</p>
                    <p>He was of the most manly growth, nearly seven feet in height, and amazingly
                        robust; bread up to hardihood, his limbs were well shapen and athletic; he
                        could endure the most laborious, toil and would with ease perform the office
                        of any two negores within the planation. His face was rather long; his eyes
                        black and fierce; his nose was not like the generality of blacks, squat and
                        flat, but rather aquiline, and</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <p>his skin remarkably clear. He discovered a great deal of expression in his
                        countenance, and a very look of reproach from him would strike terror to <rs
                            type="persGroup">his fellow slaves</rs>. He was now two and twenty years
                        of age, and every thing <rs type="person">his fond but revengeful
                            mother</rs> could wish him.</p>
                    <p>Returning from his labor to the small hovel, where he and <rs type="person"
                            >his mother</rs> dwelt, after a heavy day of toil, he threw himself
                        weary on the pallet of straw where he resposed. <persName>Amri</persName>
                        arose and claspt him in her arms.</p>
                    <p>"<said><rs type="person">My son</rs></said>," cried she, "<said>Now is the
                            time arrived when you should contend for the rights of yourself and <rs
                                type="person">mother</rs>. Now is the time when you should revenge
                            my cause. You are arrived to maturity, and, to inspire you to revenge my
                            injuries, I will relate the misfortunes of my
                    life</said>."</p></ecda:embSN>
                <p>Dear Charles, so much of the narrative was imparted to me by a negro, well
                    acquainted with Amri, and I can assure you, for I have seen this threefingered
                    Jack, that he was every thing in soul and person requisite for the hero. Give me
                    now a short pause. Sketch the man you would wish—a bold and daring fellow, ready
                    to undertake any thing for the good of his country, inspired by a rooted
                    revenge, on the strongest foundation villainy can fabricate, and Jack's the man
                    to a point. I must break off. Adieu!</p>

                    <p>breasts the seeds of hate for those who betray us. We are to transmit our
                        quarrels to our posterity, and it is incumbent on a son, from a sense of
                        filial obligation, to resent the injuries done to his parents.</p>
                    <p>"You are the only son of my womb, the only offspring of the loins of Makro,
                        and you shall be his avenger.</p>
                    <p>"<persName>Feruarue</persName>, the beloved of his country, lived in a hut,
                        at whose base murmured the waters of <placeName>Gambia</placeName>. I was
                        his only daughter, and his sole delight. Makro's parents were deceased, and
                        his hut adjoined ours.—He was but two years my elder; I loved him, and he
                        was the great friend of my father, so that our nuptials were soon
                        solemnized, and I removed from my father's home to live with my dear
                            <persName>Makro</persName>.</p>
                    <p>"How blest were we, my son! The God of our country smiled upon our stores;
                        our herbage grew beneath our eye, and our lawful traffic with the vile
                        Europeans, sanctioned by our virtuous <seg xml:id="#a001" corresp="n001"
                            >Mansa</seg>, answered our most sanguine expectations. Makro constantly
                        attended the <seg xml:id="#a002" corresp="n002">Korree</seg>, and our
                            <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> were as fine as any our nation
                        boasted</p>
                    <p>"One terrible day, my son, our God, we thought, seemed angry with us. He
                        withheld his beams; the thunder roared above, and the tremendous lightning
                        blighted the fruits of the earth. You were then but two months old within my
                        womb. All nature at that moment seemed at variance, and the storm of rain
                        drenched the Europeans' big ship; their sails were torn by the storm, and we
                        heard them fire their terrifying guns, which we afterwards understood were
                        signals of distress. Oh! what an hour was that! I stood at our cabin door
                        and saw one great swelling wave devour their ship, and they were forever
                        hurried from my sight. At that moment, with agonizing pity, I caspt my hands
                        together, and wept their fate.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, indeed, I did weep the fate of those, whom with thee I am born to
                        curse, such was <emph>then</emph> my generous unsuspecting nature. Well, the
                        storm abated in its fury, till, at last, the waters gained their original
                        calm, and the clouds above wore a more pleasing aspect.</p>
                    <p>"<persName>Makro</persName>, as was customary, was at the Koree, and, wishing
                        to know if he was well, I paced the banks of Gambia. As I looked upon the
                        waters, I beheld floating to our shore a part of the ship rent in thousand
                        twain by the merciless tempest. Lying,</p><pb/>
                    <p>"to all appearance dead, on this fragment of the wreck, were two <rs
                            type="persGroup">Europeans</rs>, locked in each other's embrace. They
                        were both young—one was scarely fourteen. Imagine, my son, the emotions of a
                        heart, ever ready to assist the distrest, on beholding such a scene.—They
                        were <rs type="persGroup">Europeans</rs>, and all <rs type="place"
                            >Africa</rs> trembled at their name; they were my country's foes, but
                        they were fallen; they claimed my pity, and I assisted them as though they
                        had been my country's firmest friends—my heart could not view them in their
                        real light.</p>
                    <p>"I hastened to the water's brink, and fast the fragment proceeded towards me;
                        at length it struck upon the shore, and I gave them all my aid. <rs
                            type="person">The captain</rs> of the seadevoured vessel was soon
                        recovered, and we both assisted to lead his nearly drowned <rs type="person"
                            >boy</rs> to our cabin.</p>
                    <p>"I had got a small European bottle, with some brandy, which my Makro took
                        from the despised of our nation, a <seg xml:id="#a003" corresp="n003"
                            >Sonakee</seg>. <persName>Captain Harrop</persName>, for so was he
                        called, smiled upon the bottle, and giving some to his servant, he was soon
                        recovered.</p>
                    <p>"My husband soon returned from the Koree, and entered our hut, while I was in
                        the</p><pb/>
                    <p>office of renovating the drooping <rs type="persGroup">Europeans</rs>; he
                        started back on beholding them, but I related the disastrous circumstance
                        that called my mercy to their aid, and he also pitied them.</p>
                    <p>"By that time, when the glorious sun witholds his beams which are canopied
                        over by the veil of night, they were both perfectly recovered.
                            <persName>Makro</persName> invited them to take some <seg xml:id="#a004"
                            corresp="n004">kous kous</seg>, of which they ate most hartily, and much
                        admired our <seg xml:id="#a005" corresp="n005">Shea Toulou</seg>, which Makro placed plentifully before them.</p>
