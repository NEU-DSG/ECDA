                <p>I have published these letters, which accidentally fell into my hands, with a
                    view to commemorate the name of <persName>Jack</persName>, and place upon the
                    list of heroes, one who, had he shone in a higher sphere, would have proved as
                    bright a luminary as ever graced the Roman annals, or ever boldly asserted the
                    rights of a Briton. His cause was great and noble, for to private wrongs he
                    added the liberty of his countrymen, and stood alone a bold and daring defender
                    of the Rights of Man. To him who shall applaud Jack through the varied scenes of
                    his life; to him, whose heart shall sympathize in his misfortunes, who shall
                    smile upon his deeds, at the same time that he laments their cause, I dedicate
                    the following pages. W.E.J.</p>

                <p>Dear Charles, Jamaica.</p>
                <p>A whole week has your letter been lying open on my desk, ready for me to answer—a
                    whole week have the above two words been written, as you may perceive by the
                    difference in the shade of the ink and the cutting of my pen; for, three times
                    has the dried standish been replenished, and twenty times, at least, have I
                    dipped into it, sometimes with a new pen, sometimes with a mended one—and still
                    at this moment am I at a loss what to say to you in reply to your queries.</p>
                <p>Now, you will think that, because I have written the above long sentence, my mind
                    is wholly and exclusively engrossed by your business, and that I shall be able
                    to go on in a regular steady way; but I tell you, Charles, it is no such thing;
                    for at the end of that very sentence, I stopped a full hour, unable to
                    proceed—and now again do I stop short.</p>
                <p>Try.</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>Try what I may, it will not do—but what is the matter? you will say. Jack!!! and
                    his cursed three fingers!!!</p>
                <p>I'll tell you what, Charles—I have just read your letter for the hundred and
                    first time, and upoin my soul, cannot see that the business it is about is of
                    such great importance; so, with or without your leave, I shall put off answering
                    it, until I have eased myself of my insufferable burthen, by dispatching Jack,
                    his three fingers, and his Obi, and all that belongs to him; for, positively, I
                    can think of nothing else.</p>
