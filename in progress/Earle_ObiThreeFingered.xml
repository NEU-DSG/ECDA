                <p>I have published these letters, which accidentally fell into my hands, with a
                    view to commemorate the name of <persName>Jack</persName>, and place upon the
                    list of heroes, one who, had he shone in a higher sphere, would have proved as
                    bright a luminary as ever graced the Roman annals, or ever boldly asserted the
                    rights of a Briton. His cause was great and noble, for to private wrongs he
                    added the liberty of his countrymen, and stood alone a bold and daring defender
                    of the Rights of Man. To him who shall applaud <persName>Jack</persName> through
                    the varied scenes of his life; to him, whose heart shall sympathize in his
                    misfortunes, who shall smile upon his deeds, at the same time that he laments
                    their cause, I dedicate the following pages. <persName>W.E.J</persName>.</p>

                <opener><salute>Dear <persName>Charles</persName></salute>,
                            <dateline><placeName>Jamaica</placeName></dateline>.</opener>
                <p>A whole week has your letter been lying open on my desk, ready for me to answer—a
                    whole week have the above two words been written, as you may perceive by the
                    difference in the shade of the ink and the cutting of my pen; for, three times
                    has the dried standish been replenished, and twenty times, at least, have I
                    dipped into it, sometimes with a new pen, sometimes with a mended one—and still
                    at this moment am I at a loss what to say to you in reply to your queries.</p>
                <p>Now, you will think that, because I have written the above long sentence, my mind
                    is wholly and exclusively engrossed by your business, and that I shall be able
                    to go on in a regular steady way; but I tell you, <persName>Charles</persName>,
                    it is no such thing; for at the end of that very sentence, I stopped a full
                    hour, unable to proceed—and now again do I stop short.</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>Try what I may, it will not do—but what is the matter? you will say.
                        <persName>Jack</persName>!!! and his cursed three fingers!!!</p>
                <p>I'll tell you what, <persName>Charles</persName>—I have just read your letter for
                    the hundred and first time, and upoin my soul, cannot see that the business it
                    is about is of such great importance; so, with or without your leave, I shall
                    put off answering it, until I have eased myself of my insufferable burthen, by
                    dispatching <persName>Jack</persName>, his three fingers, and his
                        <name>Obi</name>, and all that belongs to him; for, positively, I can think
                    of nothing else.</p>
                <p>And so it is with every body in the Island; go wherever I will the name of
                        <persName>Jack</persName> is perpetually buzzed in my ears. If I meet a
                    friend in the street, it is no longer "<said>How d'ye do</said>?" but
                        "<said>Well, what news of <persName>Jack</persName></said>?" if any of my
                    neighbors, calling his servant, says,; "<said><persName>Jack</persName>, come
                        here</said>," I start and stare about, in expectation of seeing the
                    threefingered one make his appearance. Nay, there is not a thing called
                        <persName>Jack</persName>, whether a smokejack, a boot jack, or any other
                    jack, but acts as a spell upon my senses and sets me on the fret at the bare
                    mention of it. By heavens! it is too much, and I wish...</p>
                <p>Nay, I do not—I cannot find in my heart to form the same wish that most of the
                    inhab—</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>itants here express every day. Jck is a noble fellow, and in spite of every cruel
                    hard hearted planter, I shall repeat the same to the last hour of my life.
                            "<said><persName>Jack</persName> is a Negro</said>," say they.
                            "<said><persName>Jack</persName> is a Man</said>," say I.</p>
                <p>—"<said>He is a slave</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Man cannot be a slave to Man</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>He is my property</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>How did you acquire that property</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>By paying for it</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Paying! Paying whom</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Him who brought him from Africa</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>How did he get possession of him</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>He caught him there</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Caught! what? Like a wild beast</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>No, but he contrived means to convey him into his ship</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Contrived! Then he brought him without his consent</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Very likely</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>And what has become of that robber</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Robber! He is a very respectable man, who has left off trade, has married
                        the daughter of a rich planter, and now lives very comfortably, after the
                        fatigues of an industrious life</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>What! Do they hang a poor hard-laboring man, who, driven by despair at
                        the sight of his numerous family ready to starve</said></p>
                <pb/>
                <p><said>for want of a bit of bread, takes advantage of a dark night, goes on the
                        highway and frightens teh traveller out of a few pieces of gold and shall a
                        daring ruffian, who is openly guilty of a crime more heinous in its nature
                        and baneful in its effects, get respected by every body and pass his days in
                        the peaceable enjoyment of riches acquired by such infamous
                    means</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>I don't understand you. I never heard that the traffic was infamous. Is
                        it not authorised by all the nations of Europe, Asia and America? Have not
                        regulations been made concerning it by all governments</said>?"</p>
                <p>—"<said>Very true, but that does not make it more honorable. Prostitution is
                        authorised, yes, for it is more than tolerated, by governments, many of
                        which have also made regulations concerning it, but that does make it less
                        infamous</said>."</p>
                <p>—"<said>Nay, you are going too far, and this is widely different</said>.</p>
                <p>—"<said>Different !—By heavens ! you will drive me mad</said>."</p>

                <p>And such, my dear <persName>Charles</persName>, is the daily altercation I have
                    with the greatest part of the planters here, and what you have just read is a
                    specimen of the various arguments brought on both sides of the question. As I
                    know your sentiments upon the subject, I shall close</p>
                <pb/>
                <p>it here and proceed to my narrative about <persName>threefingered
                    Jack</persName>, and as I have made it my business to collect every particular
                    relative to him, I believe I shall have it in my power to give you a
                    circumstantial account of all his actions. In fact, what I am now going to write
                    is nothing more than a copy of what I had sometime ago begun to put into a
                    regular story, out of several memoranda collected at different times. So without
                    lengthening this preamble, I thus begin:</p>
                <ecda:embSN>
                    <p><persName>Amri</persName> was a beautiful slave, the property of
                            <persName>Mr. Mornton</persName>, of <placeName>Maroons
                        Town</placeName>. She was sanguinary in her temper; for, misfortunre, or
                        rather cruelty, had perverted a heart naturally inclined to virtue. She was
                        torn from the arms of her husband, her family and friends, while in the
                        mayday of her life, from her native <placeName>Africa</placeName></p>
                    <p>She had vowed to curse <rs type="persGroup">the European race</rs> for ever;
                        and had a son, in whose breast she never failed to nurture the baneful
                        passion of revenge</p>
                    <p>She taught him to despise his groaning companions, complaining under their
                        labor, meanly submitting to the christian whip, and then pusillanimously
                        venting their griefs in half suprressed sighs</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <p><persName>Jack</persName> had a soul, even in infancy, superior to such
                        whining; he complained not of the daily labor heaped upon him, but of the
                        tardiness of time.</p>
                    <p>Each night, when the grand luminator of the world hid his rays within the
                        deep, he threw himself on his knees, and prayed the great God of his country
                        to ripen him to manhood, that he might shake off the yoke that pressed heavy
                        upon him, and revenge the cause of his country and his parents. His youthful
                        fiery soul led him to imagine himself the destroyer of all
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName>; he saw in the warlike picture his fancy
                        drew, the course he was to fllow, and the transport of his heart was often
                        visible by the uncommon hauteur of his manners. When assured of revenge, he
                        would grin with a smile of malice, transparent on his cheek, at the
                        overseer, while the merciless whip was lacerating his back.</p>
                    <p>He was of the most manly growth, nearly seven feet in height, and amazingly
                        robust; bread up to hardihood, his limbs were well shapen and athletic; he
                        could endure the most laborious, toil and would with ease perform the office
                        of any two negores within the planation. His face was rather long; his eyes
                        black and fierce; his nose was not like the generality of blacks, squat and
                        flat, but rather aquiline, and</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <p>his skin remarkably clear. He discovered a great deal of expression in his
                        countenance, and a very look of reproach from him would strike terror to <rs
                            type="persGroup">his fellow slaves</rs>. He was now two and twenty years
                        of age, and every thing <rs type="person">his fond but revengeful
                            mother</rs> could wish him.</p>
                    <p>Returning from his labor to the small hovel, where he and <rs type="person"
                            >his mother</rs> dwelt, after a heavy day of toil, he threw himself
                        weary on the pallet of straw where he resposed. <persName>Amri</persName>
                        arose and claspt him in her arms.</p>
                    <p>"<said><rs type="person">My son</rs></said>," cried she, "<said>Now is the
                            time arrived when you should contend for the rights of yourself and <rs
                                type="person">mother</rs>. Now is the time when you should revenge
                            my cause. You are arrived to maturity, and, to inspire you to revenge my
                            injuries, I will relate the misfortunes of my
                    life</said>."</p></ecda:embSN>
                <p>Dear Charles, so much of the narrative was imparted to me by a negro, well
                    acquainted with Amri, and I can assure you, for I have seen this threefingered
                    Jack, that he was every thing in soul and person requisite for the hero. Give me
                    now a short pause. Sketch the man you would wish—a bold and daring fellow, ready
                    to undertake any thing for the good of his country, inspired by a rooted
                    revenge, on the strongest foundation villainy can fabricate, and Jack's the man
                    to a point. I must break off. Adieu!</p>
                <pb/>

                    <p>"<persName>Feruarue</persName>, the beloved of his country, lived in a hut,
                        at whose base murmured the waters of <placeName>Gambia</placeName>. I was
                        his only daughter, and his sole delight. Makro's parents were deceased, and
                        his hut adjoined ours.—He was but two years my elder; I loved him, and he
                        was the great friend of my father, so that our nuptials were soon
                        solemnized, and I removed from my father's home to live with my dear
                            <persName>Makro</persName>.</p>
                    <p>"How blest were we, <rs type="person">my son</rs>! The God of our country smiled upon our stores;
                        our herbage grew beneath our eye, and our lawful traffic with the vile
                        Europeans, sanctioned by our virtuous <seg xml:id="a001" corresp="#n001"
                            >Mansa</seg>, answered our most sanguine expectations. Makro constantly
                        attended the <seg xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002">Korree</seg>, and our
                            <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> were as fine as any our nation
                        boasted</p>
                    <p>"One terrible day, <rs type="person">my son</rs>, our God, we thought, seemed angry with us. He
                        withheld his beams; the thunder roared above, and the tremendous lightning
                        blighted the fruits of the earth. You were then but two months old within my
                        womb. All nature at that moment seemed at variance, and the storm of rain
                        drenched the Europeans' big ship; their sails were torn by the storm, and we
                        heard them fire their terrifying guns, which we afterwards understood were
                        signals of distress. Oh! what an hour was that! I stood at our cabin door
                        and saw one great swelling wave devour their ship, and they were forever
                        hurried from my sight. At that moment, with agonizing pity, I caspt my hands
                        together, and wept their fate.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, indeed, I did weep the fate of those, whom with thee I am born to
                        curse, such was <emph>then</emph> my generous unsuspecting nature. Well, the
                        storm abated in its fury, till, at last, the waters gained their original
                        calm, and the clouds above wore a more pleasing aspect.</p>
                    <p>"<persName>Makro</persName>, as was customary, was at the Koree, and, wishing
                        to know if he was well, I paced the banks of Gambia. As I looked upon the
                        waters, I beheld floating to our shore a part of the ship rent in thousand
                        twain by the merciless tempest. Lying,</p><pb/>
                    <p>"to all appearance dead, on this fragment of the wreck, were two <rs
                            type="persGroup">Europeans</rs>, locked in each other's embrace. They
                        were both young—one was scarely fourteen. Imagine, <rs type="person">my son</rs>, the emotions of a
                        heart, ever ready to assist the distrest, on beholding such a scene.—They
                        were <rs type="persGroup">Europeans</rs>, and all <rs type="place"
                            >Africa</rs> trembled at their name; they were my country's foes, but
                        they were fallen; they claimed my pity, and I assisted them as though they
                        had been my country's firmest friends—my heart could not view them in their
                        real light.</p>
                    <p>"I hastened to the water's brink, and fast the fragment proceeded towards me;
                        at length it struck upon the shore, and I gave them all my aid. <rs
                            type="person">The captain</rs> of the seadevoured vessel was soon
                        recovered, and we both assisted to lead his nearly drowned <rs type="person"
                            >boy</rs> to our cabin.</p>
                    <p>"I had got a small European bottle, with some brandy, which my
                            <persName>Makro</persName> took from the despised of our nation, a <seg
                            xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003">Sonakee</seg>. <persName>Captain
                            Harrop</persName>, for so was he called, smiled upon the bottle, and
                        giving some to his servant, he was soon recovered.</p>
                    <p>"My husband soon returned from the Koree, and entered our hut, while I was in
                        the kindly<pb/> office of renovating the drooping <rs type="persGroup"
                            >Europeans</rs>; he started back on beholding them, but I related the
                        disastrous circumstance that called my mercy to their aid, and he also
                        pitied them.</p>
                    <p>"By that time, when the glorious sun witholds his beams which are canopied
                        over by the veil of night, they were both perfectly recovered.
                            <persName>Makro</persName> invited them to take some <seg xml:id="a004"
                            corresp="#n004">kous kous</seg>, of which they ate most hartily, and
                        much admired our <seg xml:id="a005" corresp="#n005">Shea Toulou</seg>, which
                            <persName>Makro</persName> placed plentifully before them. My <rs

                        veins. He was generous and humane (in person thou art his model) of manly
                        growth, of a fierce and intrepid disposition, commanding reverence from his
                        countrymen, and dreaded by his country's foe. He was active and alert in
                        times of war; lionhearted, proud and generous, he would lead his men to
                        victory, and was adored the as greatest war captain of his country. In
                        peace, he was gentle as the lamb, candid in his heart, and constantly
                        exercised his time by a shepherd's employ.</p>
                    <p>"After our guests had eat and were much refreshed, <persName>Makro</persName>
                        bid them proceed to the European settlements on the Gambia, of</p><pb/>
                    <p>which there are many, for the vile practice of purchasing slaves. I filled
                        two <seg xml:id="a006" corresp="#n006">soffroos</seg> for them, but they
                        most earnestly entreated to rest the night with us, and Makro, after some
                        hesitation, consented to my preparing a temporary <seg xml:id="a007"
                            corresp="#n007">baloon</seg> for them. We all retured to our several
                        pallets, and the next day <persName>Captain Harrop</persName>, was attacked
                        by a violent fever. I attended him, and, indeed, I did as much as lay in my
                        power to relieve his anguish.</p>
                    <p>"Oh! my <rs type="person">son</rs>, I will pass over this part of my

                        rends my heart in twain. I sang him to his slumbers; I procured him a
                        cooling drink; I added to his pallet, softened it for his weak frame, and
                        cheered him in the hour of affliction. What was my reward? What was my
                        recompense? Chains! Chains! <rs type="person">my son</rs>, and lifeclosing slavery. Here it thou

                        him with thy malice. <pb/> I have food at heart, aided by thee, to rouse his
                        lion soul from inactivity to revengeful slaughter. Then reject not a

                    <p>"<persName>Captain Harrop</persName> recovered but slowly; he was wasted away
                        to a mere shadow, and leaning on my arm for the benefit of the pure air, he
                        would walk out and view our herbage.—"<said>Nature! nature!</said> would he
                        cry as he inspected our fertile fields, "<said>how profuse art thou, how
                            lavish of thy bounty!</said>"</p>
                    <p>During his stay with us, he had taught me sufficient of his language to
                        understand him, and I listened to what he said. I asked him in unaffected
                        ignorance, Who was nature? "<said>The great Creator</said>," answered he;
                            "<said>He to whom you owe your being</said>." I did not rightly
                        comprehend him, but he soon gave me to understand that I worshipped a false
                        god. I looked upon him with astonishment. He told me the glorious sun was
                        but a substance created by his God, who was the great father of all. He told
                        me of the enlivening power of the sun. "<said>I</said>," cried he,
                            "<said>feel its warmth in my heart; its splendor inspires me with an
                            active spirit to fulfil the duties of this life and enjoy society. You

                    <pb/><p><said>cheers the herbage of the field, when drooping; it sheds its
                            enlivening rays, expands the opening leaf, which soon revels in
                            prosperity. So the charitable man spreads his kindly rays around,
                            revives the deprest, becomes a father to the orphan, a husband to the
                            widow; by him are the afflicted comforted, the enlightened, and the poor
                            relieved. Oh! Amri, a charitable man is the noblest work of
                        God."</said></p>
                    <p>"I was amazed to hear him speak; I thought him all virtue: How wretchedly was
                        I deceived! Indeed, for the moment, he staggered my relief that I was doing
                        right in worshipping as he said, the servant of the real God. He made me
                        remark the setting of the sun; I was charmed with what he said, and could
                        for ever have listened to him. "<said>Behold</said>," said he, "<said>how
                            complete are his works, and observe the gradual approach of night. The

                            to illumine other parts of this vast globe, which are hidden from your

                            night is spreading her grey curtain over the sky. Acknowledge the wisdom
                            of the Creator here to be infinite, as the sudden transition from light

                    <p>"I readily assented, and we returned to our cabin. <persName>Makro</persName>
                        was there already, and the <rs type="person">Captain's boy</rs> was
                        instructing him in his language.</p>
                    <p>"At the approach of morning, <persName>Captain Harrop</persName> tapped at my

                        pearls. I was wwrapped in wonder and delight, for never before did I know
                        how to discover those beauties which appeared to my astonished sight, and
                        which <persName>Makro</persName> viewed with increased pleasure.How
                        beautifully green did the vale beneath appear! how did my eye wander over

                    <p>and meadows, that were watered by soft murmuring rivulets!</p>
                    <p>"The clouds were tinged and variegated with the sweetest colors; the light
                        insensibily increased, till the sun rising shot his first ray across the

                        beheld his slow appraoch.— The eastern sky was previously clothed with
                        purple, which, as the sun approached, gradually assumed a rosy tint, and
                        gilded the hemisphere with blushing gold.</p>
                    <p>"<persName>Makro</persName> fell on his face, and embraced the earth in awful

                    <p>"Day followed day, and each brought something that endeared him to us the
                        more. He was gay, lively, and would often teach me the</p><pb/>
                    <p>songs of his country, at the same time commending my retentive memory.</p>
                    <p>"In short, two months soon elapsed in company of him who could so well
                        instruct us how to adore the works of the infinite Creator of all things,
                        and each day enliven our understandings by producing something new for us to
                        admire.</p>
                    <p>"Oh! could we think it possible that the man who daily habituated our ears to
                        tales of humanity could, while he grasped our hands in seeming friendly
                        warmth, have a scheme in his head to blast our prospect of future peace, we
                        who stood forward as his saviors! we could find no such deception in our own
                        countrymen, and were not sufficiently acquainted with the character of <rs
                            type="persGroup">the Europeans</rs>.</p>
                    <p>"Free from suspicion, we laid ourselves open to his cursed wiles, and become
                        the dupes of our own credulity.</p>
                    <p>"Rendered more rational, we found beauties in nature which our countrymen
                        could not discover; and <persName>Makro</persName> and myself would stroll
                        far from our habitation, to again behold those scenes which he had taught us
                        to delight in.</p>
                    <p>"One day, while reclining upon a hillock, we heard the sounds of voices at a
                        little distance from us. It was the two Europeans; and
                            <persName>Makro</persName>, not understanding their language so</p><pb/>
                    <p>well as myself, imposed on me a momentary silence, that he might listen to
                        what they said; not from curiosity, for no such desire actuated our breasts,
                        (then indeed we scarcely knew what it meant) but from the pure motive of
                        learning whether we could understand them with facility</p>
                    <p>"<persName>The captain</persName>'s voice we first distinguished; his words,
                        <rs type="person">my son</rs> are forever impressed upon my memory, and I can with ease relate
                        them.</p>
                    <p>"<said><persName>William</persName>,</said>" said he to <rs type="person">his
                            boy</rs>, "<said>I never can consent to be buried in this wild
                            uncultivated spot, lost to my friends and to the world; reflect that it
                            is for their own good, as much as for my benefit, Have I not enlightened
                            them, fertilized their minds, told them of the duties of this life, and
                            how to enjoy society? What were they, when first we set foot on their
                            shore? savages, dwelling with savages: I tell you,
                                <persName>William</persName>,....."</said></p>
                    <p>"<said>Sir,</said>" interrupted <rs type="person">the boy</rs>,"<said>have
                            you a heart? but no, I am wrong, you are only trying whether the heart
                            of your poor boy is softened by humanity. I am sure it is not, it cannot
                            be your intention; I must not, I will not believe it."</said></p>
                    <p>"<said>Peace fool,</said>" resumed <persName>the captain</persName>;
                            "<said>you never know me changeable in my determination</said>."</p><pb/>
                    <p>"He ceased; we soon understood he spoke of us, and that he was about to leave
                        our country. <persName>Makro</persName> looked at me; I saw the manly tear
                        upon his cheek; he sorrowed for the intended departure of <rs
                            type="persGroup">the Europeans</rs>, who had gained our love, and he
                        pressed me to his heart, the palpitation of which was almost too strong for
                        our nature to support.</p>
                    <p>"They continued—</p>
                    <p>"<said>It is most fortunate</said>," rejoined the captain; "<said>the arrival
                            of one of my own ships from <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>! it favors my
                            views, and tomorrow shall see us on board</said>."</p>
                    <p>"<said>They will send their boat for us to shore, in the morning</said>,"
                        answered <persName>William</persName>.</p>
                    <p>"<said>Till then, peace</said>," added <persName>Captain Harrop</persName>;
                            "<said>a close mouth is a good safeguard</said>."</p>
                    <p>"We were both too much affected to accost them, for we expected they should
                        reside with us for ever.</p>
                    <p>"<said>Ah!</said>" sighed Makro, "<said>my dear <persName>Amri</persName> our
                            expectations were unnatural; do <emph>we</emph> not love cour country?
                            Say, could we leave it, our family and our friends? Oh! no—perhaps in
                                <placeName>European plains</placeName>, he may have a wife, who
                            loves him dearly, and, <persName>Amri</persName></said>, I judge by
                        myself, I could not leave thee."</p>
                    <p>"This was sufficient; <persName>Makro</persName> silenced with</p><pb/>
                    <p>in my breast the upbraider that accused them of ingratitude.</p>
                    <p>"We returned home; they were there before us, and soon perceived in our
                        countenance an unusual dejection.</p>
                    <p>"<said>My worthy friend</said>," cried <persName>Captain Harrop</persName>,
                        catching my hand and wiping the tear from my cheek, "<said>are you not well?
                            say, what has befallen you? Why this dejection</said>?"</p>
                    <p>"I had not power to refrain uttering the cause of my grief, and replied, at
                        the same time clasping his hand, while the tear-glistened in my eye:
                            "<said>I expected you would have resided with us for ever, and
                                <persName>Marko</persName> and myself heard you say you were about
                            to leave our country</said>."</p>
                    <p>I saw a deadly paleness overspread his countenance, (I knew not then the
                        cause) but recovering in a moment, he replied:</p>
                    <p>"<said>And does that distress you? Indeed, my gentle friends, it is essential
                            to my own happiness; I have relatives in England that think me dead; I
                            have large possessions, which, if I remain here, will fall into other
                            hands. I have also a wife and children; these are strong arguments in
                            favor of my return to a country to which I owe my birth. I am sure you
                            cannot blame me; to you I owe my life, and my wife and children are
                            bound to pray for you</said>.</p><pb/>
                    <p><said>If I idle my days here, I am of no service to them or my country, and
                            then the life which you have preserved, your invaluable gift, is
                            rendered useless</said>.</p>
                    <p>"<said>In <placeName>Europe</placeName>, we live to assist one another, to
                            share the labors of the day, and make life supportable. We barter our
                            commodities more extensively than you do here, and the great exchange is
                            diffusing round the world, like the generating sun, the rays of
                            prosperity and affluence</said>."</p>
                    <p>"<said>Since it must be so</said>," I replied, "<said>I have no other
                            altnernative; may you be happy!" and placing a <seg xml:id="a009"
                                corresp="#n009">Saphie</seg> round his neck, "may this preserve you
                            in the hour of need! its virtue will protect you from the arms of the

                            poor <persName>Amri</persName> and her husband

                    <p>"I was deeply affected, and <persName>William</persName>, <persName>the
                            Captain</persName>'s servant, falling on his knees, and catching at the
                        lappet of his coat, cried: "<said>Master, have mercy</said>!"</p>
                    <p>"<said>Silence, slave</said>!" returned he stamping his</p><pb/>
                    <p>foot upon the ground and flinging him away. I saw him tremble, and his cheek
                        was crimsoned with a malignant hatred; his eyes rolled furiously, and
                        sparkled in anger.</p>
                    <p>"<persName>Marko</persName> rose from his seat.</p>
                    <p>"A something ran through my veins, and my blood was cold; a faintness seized
                        my limbs, and my heart forgot its usual pulsation.</p>
                    <p>"<persName>William</persName> now regained his seat, and, hiding his face in
                        his hand, cried: "Most inhuman!" <persName>Harrop</persName> recovered
                        himself, and, placing his hand upon his forehead, declared himself unwell;
                        he embraced my husband, who stood by his side, with all the fervor of
                        friendship, and assured him he could not order it otherwise; then shaking
                        hands with his servant, begged his pardon for the harshness of his conduct.
                        We soon retired to our several pallets."</p></ecda:embSN>
                <p>Dear <persName>Charles</persName>, I must intreat a moment's patience, if my

                    intreaty.</p>
                <p>My paper is filled, my pen worn to the stump—mind flagged—fingers cramped—and my
                    little finger wears as fine a polish as an agate. Indeed, when I sat down I did
                    not think of entering so far in the narrative of Amri in this letter.</p>

                    thousands here that have hearts like rocks. Children, from their birth, tutored
                    to inhumanity, and treat our fellow creatues worse than the dogs that lick the

                <p>I shall proceed to delineate the character of an European Westindian, in the

                <p>"In the morning, Makro would not go, as was customary to the Koree, because he
                    would witness the departure of his friend, and we took a walk for the last time,
                    accompanied by <persName>Captain Harrop</persName>, to view the surrounding
                    plain.</p>

                <p>"We arrived at the top of a hill, where we always made our observations, and a
                    withered brance of a tree lay at our feet; he made us examine it.</p>
                <p>"<said>Look</said>," cried he; "<said>here is another subject to admire; behold
                        this tree flourishing, while an arm that was lopped from its side now

                <p>"<said>This is a subject worthy of your minute attention. This arm, divested of

                        no succor from the body, to which it once belonged. The blood that flows in
                        your veins would no longer enliven that limb, and the place from whence it
                        was torn would soon be covered by a growing skin</said>.</p>
                <p>"<said>We eat and are eaten by creatures of the earth; thousands inhabit our
                        mortal frame, and thousands inhabit the body of that tree. That receives a
                        sustenance from the earth, and the spreading veings convey the sap of life

                <p>"This observation did but increase our agony at the idea of separation. I could
                    have loved him, adored him. Ours were not weak minds, <rs type="person">my son</rs>; they were pliant
