                <p>The Committee, in obedience to your Majesty's said Order of Reference, <!-- title?? -->
                    proceeded immediately to investigate the Subject so referred, and
                    examined such Persons as either offered themselves, or such as they
                    thought proper to summon, being in the Judgment of the Committee
                    likely to convey useful Information thereupon; and they applied to the
                    Agents for the several <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Islands in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and to your
                    Majesty's Governors and the Councils and Assemblies of the said Islands;

                    for Anwers to such Questions as appeared in the Committee to be calculated
                    to produce Information on the several parts of this extensive
                    Subject. The Committee thought proper likewise to apply to your
                    Majesty's Ministers at Foreign Courts for such Information as they might
                    be able to procure concerning the State of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade as carried
                    on by Foreign Countries, and concerning the Manner of transporting

                    to be searched for all the Information to be found therein respecting
                    this Subject. They also called for, and obtained from the Public 
                    Offices and other Sources, such Accounts as appeared to them to be
                    likely to throw light upon any of the Heads of this Inquiry, and 
                    particularly upon the Extent and Value of this Trade in all its Branches,

                                fixed System of Government; they have a council, consisting of the Alcaide or Governor,
                                the Gerouff or Mayor, the Marabou or Priest, and some of the Elders of the Village, the
                                whole Council being from Seven to Nine in Number; These consult and advise the King,
                                but he is not obliged to follow their Advice, nor does he ever do so, unless it consists with his
                                own Opinion or Interest, or that he apprehends they will have Force sufficient to resist him,
                                which they frequently do.

                            <p>To furnish the Revenues of these Kingdoms, every Village pays a regular Custom to the

                                Merchandize brought from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. When this Custom is paid regularly, the King
                                first gives Notice to pay it, and if not then paid within a certain Time, he comes down with

                                if not, they are sold for Slaves. The Kings <emph>never</emph> break a Village without some such
                                Pretence; they are understood to be Masters of the Lives of their Subjects; but they use
                                this Power with very great Lenity; only when any of their Subjects are represented by the
                                Alcaide, or Chief of the Village, to be incorrigible, the King makes no Scruple of cutting

                                able to maintain them. The Wives are in general Slaves to the Husbands, and work very

                            resided in the <placeName>Isles de Los</placeName> and the <placeName>River Kissey</placeName> on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> about Two Years,
                            from <date from="1768" to="1770">1768 to 1770</date>, as Factor, and quitted the Trade in <date when="1784">1784</date>.

                        <p>In the Parts opposite to the <placeName>Isles de Los</placeName>, and the Neighbourhood to the Northward
                            of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, where <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has been, the Country is divided into a Number of petty
                            States, ruled by Kings or head Men, whose Districts are very small. The Power of these 
                            Kings or head Men is not absolute and arbitrary; and they generally call a Council consisting of
                            head Men, who are Relations of the Princes, in which all Matters, civil or military, are
                            decided. The religious Institutions of these petty States are principally <name>Pagan</name>; there
                            are some <name>Mahometans</name>, and on the Northern Rivers a few black <name>Christians</name>, made such by 
                            the <name>Portuguese</name> when they were established among them.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being aksed, Whether the Black <name>Christians</name>, or the <name>Mahometans</name>, make any Converts?
                            replied, the <name>Mahometans</name> make a great many by force: There is a large warlike
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Country to the North-east of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, called <placeName>Fula</placeName>, whose Inhabitants are
                            descended from <name>Arabs</name>; though of a darker colour, they have <rs type="properAdjective">Arab</rs> Features. The Poers
                            of this Country is employed in making Converts to <name>Mahometanism</name>; they have made a great
                            Progress in converting the People of the <placeName>Susa Country</placeName>, which is a Part of the Coast. The
                            Princes on the <placeName>Rivers Kissey</placeName> and <placeName>Malachurry</placeName>, which are also a Part of this Coast, are Tributaries
                            to the Fula King;  and in thes Two last Countries great Progress has been made in
                            <name>Mahometanism</name>, and is still making. The Black <name>Christians</name> do not attempt to make any
                            Converts; they are an obscure Sort of People, and mix <name>Paganism</name> with the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Religion.
                            The <persName>King of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName></persName> sent on of his <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-religion="mohametan">Sons</ecda:persGroup> in <date when="1769">1769</date> to the <placeName>Fula Country</placeName> to learn
                            <name>Mahometanism</name>, and <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-religion="christian">another</ecda:anonPers> to <placeName>Lancaster</placeName> to learn the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Relgion; the latter turned out very
                            profligate. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has seen in that Country several <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> Teachers come down with
                            Transcripts from the <rs type="title">Khoran</rs>, to whom they pay great Respect. These Men are sometimes
                            employed in instructing the Youth of the Country in the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> Language and in the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> 
                            Religion, and with great Success, and they are in general devout; but notwithstanding
                            their Devotion, the <name>Europeans</name> do not find either their Lives or Properties so safe in the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Towns as in those where <name>Paganism</name> prevails. The <name>Pagans</name> are humble and submissive;
                            the <name>Mahometans</name> are proud and insolent.

                            whose Manners and Governments are nearly similar, about five Days Journey inland, where 
                            the <name>Europeans</name> have been longest settled, and possess the greates Number of Forts, Civilization
                            has improved beyond any thing he has discovered in any other Country of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and the
                            People have Civil Rights arising from traditionary Laws and Customs; but, even in this
                            Coutnry, much remains to be done towards Civilization. The Bussou and Craba, the confidential
                            Man and favourate Woman, of every Person of Distinction are usually put to Death
                            and interred him.: The imputed Crime of Witchcraft is still believed there, and is
                            punished with Transportation.</said>—By Transportation, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> means, selling them to the White
                            Traders, which is represented in this Nation as the greatest Evil that can befal them, in order
                            to deter them from Crimes. The superior State of Civilization in this Country, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>
                            imputes to their Intercourse with <name>Europeans</name>; and added—Report says, that formerly a much
                            greater Number were but to Death, and interred with their deceased Lords.

                        <p><name>Paganism</name> is universal.—By <name>Paganism</name>, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> means, the Worship of those Objects which
                            strike the Senses.—At <placeName>Whyday</placeName>, a Snake is the principal Object of their Worship; and, besides
                            this, Trees, Caverns, and Amulets round their Necks which are furnished by their Priests.
                            At <placeName>Cape Coast</placeName>, the Rocks on which the Fort is built is their Tutelar Deity. A Tyger is the
                            immediate Object of the <persName>King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>'s</persName> Worship.

                            conquered by the <placeName>King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName></placeName>, the Worship of the Snake was continued upon Motives
                            of Policy. Formerly, a Person who killed a Snake was put to Death; but now a Goat is sacrificed
                            as an Atonement.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> doubts whether a Tyger is the Object of Worship of the King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>,
                            But says it is an Animal esteemed royal, and it is not to be killed.

                        <p>Respecting the Civil Rights of the People, <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> says—They enjoy Civil Rights
                            and Privileges that are of more ancient Date than our Settlement among them.—He does not
                            believe that the Natives are much improved in their Morals by their Intercourse with the
                            <name>Europeans</name>; on the contrary, he thinks that the worst Blacks are those who have been the most 
                            concerned with the Whites; their Manners and Dress are in some Degree improved thereby.

                            the most Western <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Settlement: There the King is absolute; the Monarchy is hereditary 
                            in the male Issue of the female Line; the Country is large and Populous. Every other 
                            Part of the <placeName>Gold Goast</placeName> is divided into various petty States, governed by very limited
                            Monarchs: The Government consists, first, of the King; then of the Elders, who are rarely chosen
                            till they have arrived at the Age of Sixty: Upon the Death of any one of them, the Body of
                            these Elders recommends a Successor to the King, who usually confirms the Choice they have
                            made. The third Estate is composed of Captains of the Troops or Town Soldiers, chosen by
                            the People at large, and removable at their Pleasure. These Countries, so governed, are for the
                            most Part populous.

                        <p>The Inhabitants are <name>Pagans</name>, and have different material Objects of Worship, such as Rivers,
                            Rocks, and various Idols; to which, on particular Ocassions, they sacrifice Sheep and Goats;
                            and sometimes they make human Sacrifices, of which (though very much discouraged by 
                            <name>Europeans</name>, and therefore practised in secret) <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> has had ocular Demonstration. They
                            recalled Sophas, whose Persons are on all Occasions sacred.

                            very exact and strict; they are punished with the Loss of Liberty for the smallest Theft, and
                            all other Crimes; they have a faint Idea of a future State.

                            tthe Month of <date when="1780-12">December 1780</date>, he became Governor of <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName>, and continued so

                            till his Return to <placeName>England</placeName> in <date when="1784-01">January 1784</date>.

                        <p>The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is divided into a Number of small Governments, principally consisting of
                            limited Monarchies.
                        </p>
                        <p>The People are all <name>Pagans</name>; they worship the Moon, which is one of their greatest
                            Deities, and Rocks and other Visible Objects. They appear to have a Sense of a supernatural
                            Being, and of a future State, and this they shew by the Sacrifices they make at the Death of
                            their principal People, when they sacrifice some of the Slaves belonging to the deceased, or 
                            others whom they purchase for that Purpose. The Number sacrificed is in Proportion to the
                            Rank of the deceased. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> never saw any of these sacrifices, but has seen the poor 
                            Victims parading about, Two or Three days before they were to be sacrificed, they did not
                            appear to be dejected, but quite the contrary they were dressed out. It was not customary 
                            for <name>Europeans</name> to go to these Ceremonies, and <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> rather thinks the Natives would
                            have made Objections. The <name>Europeans</name> have always endeavoured to prevent this, but the
                            People have a superstitious Idea, that the Manes of the deceased would not be satisfied unless
                            these Sacrifices were made. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> was not near enough to observe whether the Victims
                            appeared to be intoxicated as a Fact, but conceives they had given them Spirits.

                        <p>The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is divided into a Number of petty States, governed by Chiefs or Caboceers.
                            They suppose that an ideal Being, called Braffoe, superintends all these States; and this
                            Being they consult by means of their Priests or <distinct>Fetiche Men</distinct>. These Caboceers have each

                            their particular Vassals, but they have not such absolute Power over them as to be able to
                            dispose of them without the Consent of their Fellow Vassals, or the Pynims or Elders of the
                            Town. The Caboceers have no Power over the Lives and Property of their Vassals, except
                            in consequence of Trial, which is before these Pynims or Elders.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> has not observed that the People on this Coast are more civilized than in

                        <p>The Religion is <name>Paganism</name>, and the Objects of their Worship are various, but chiefly
                            sensible Objects; it is so unintelligible, that it is extremely difficult to give any Account of it.
                            The Fisherman of <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName> worship the Rock on which the Castle stands; and when
                            they cross the <placeName>River Volta</placeName> they throw a Bottle of Rum into it to secure them a favourable
                            Passage and safe Return. They have various Superstitions with respect to Food, some 
                            eating one Sort only, and some another.

                            conquered by his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">Grandfather</ecda:anonPers> about Sixty Years ago. In <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> there is not individual
                            Freeman, except the King. The King is absolute Master of the Lives and Properties
                            of his Subjects, and he sports with their Lives in the most wanton and savage
                            Manner. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> has seen at the Gates of his Palace Two Piles of Heads, like Shoe in
                            an Arsenal; within the Palace, the Heads of Persons newly put to death are strewed at
                            the Distance of a few yeards in the Passage that leads to the Apartment of the Tyrant, in
                            order to inspire the Person who is to be admitted to an Audience  with Awe and Terror,
                            <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> does not speak of One particular Tyrant; it is the Custom of the Country on 
                            great Occasions, such as the Reception of Messengers from neighbouring States, or of White
                            Merchants, and in general on Days of Ceremonial; but the great Carnage is once a Year,
                            when the Poll Tax is paid by his Subjects. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot exactly say how many are
                            executed in this Manner in the Course of the Year, but speaks within Compass when he
                            reckons them at a Thousand. This is the Custom of the Monarchy, and this Power extends
                            over his whole Dominions. The Kingdom is very populous and runs about 350 Miles
                            inland. The Roof of the Palace is decorated with a prodigious Number of human Heads;
                            and when the King means to make War, it is an Expression in use to say, <distinct rend="italic">The Palace wants <!-- @type here?? -->
                            Thatching</distinct>. The great Men of the Coutnry cut off a few Heads in these Festivals, which is 
                            a Part ontly of the same Ceremonial, and the Victims are taken from those destined for
                            Execution by the King. Parents have no Sort of Property in their Children in the <rs type="properAdjective">Dahoman</rs>
                            Territories; the Children belong entirely to the King, and are taken by his Order from their
                            Mothers at an early Age, and distributed in Villaged remote from the Place of their Nativity,
                            where there is but little Chance of their being seen, or at least recongized by their Parents
                            afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Motive of this is, that there may be no Family Connections or Combinations, no

                            Submission and Obedience.

                            without Choice and at Random, and whether they have undergone any Form of Trial?
                            replied, On these Occasions the Slave Holes (by which he means a strong Room in every
                            Slave-merchant's House) are ransacked, and the Sweepings of them, that is the Slaves rejected
                            by the White Men, furnish a Part of these public Executions, which consist besides of
                            Prisoners taken in War, and Delinquents. These Person are carried before a Magistrate and
                            undergo a Sort of Trial. There is no particuplar Time when the Slave Holes are fuller than
                            at others; the Slaves are brought in at different Times and sold as Occasion offers; the
                            Trade is always going on except in War. Being asked, Whether the Inhabitants of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>
                            are taken for these public Executions without having had some Delinquency previously imputed
                            to them? he replied, Those who have not been accused of any Crime are liable to be
                            induced in the public Executions, when Delinquents, or Captives taken in War do not
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            supply a sufficient Number: Notwithstanding this, the People of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> never quit the
                            Country; with an Extraordinary Submission, they revere the Name of their Sovereign, and
                            never mention it in their most private Apartments without kneeling; such is the Force of 
                            Education and Habit. At <placeName>Abomey</placeName>, One of the Royal Residences, there are Twenty-five thousand
                            Inhabitants, and at <placeName>Calmina</placeName>, the other Royal Residence, about Sixteen Thousand.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether if there were no People of the Description before mentioned, the
                            innocent Inhabitants of Dahomey would be put to death on these Occasions? he replied,
                            There is no Doubt, in such Case they would particularly on the great annual Ceremony,
                            diminish the Number of these Sacrifices. If the King is in want of European Goods,
                            the Number of Executions is smaller; if he is overstocked with Powder, Arms, and <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Goods, not wanting Slaves for purchase of them, he puts to Death a greater Number; as
                            it is considered as Part of his Power and Magnificence to make a great Slaughter on this
                            Occasion, and it is celebrated accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether the Prisoners of War are always made Slaves, or are
                            sometimes put to death? replied, in consequence of a War that was going on when he was
                            there, 1500 Prisoners were made, many of whom were offered to him. which he declined
                            purchasing, as they appeared unhealty. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="king" a-gender="male">King</ecda:anonPers> thereupon told him, since that was the 
                            Case, he would put them to death. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> advised him against it, and recommended to
                            him to make them Salt Boilers, as they came from the Country that supplied him with Salt, 
                            or to employ them in some other Way; but the King replied, it would be setting a bad 
                            Example, and bringing People into the Country who would hold seditious Language. That
                            his was a peculiar Government, and that these strange People might prejudice his Subjects
                            against it, and infect them with Sentiments incomparable with it. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot say what
                            became of these Prisoners; has no Doubt but many sound Purchasers, but imagines the rest
                            were put to death. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> believes it to be the general Practice in <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> to put the
                            Prisoners of War to death unless they are sold.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Treatment of Strangers, Whites or Blacks, on coming into the Territory
                            of this Prince, Mr. Norris says, the Whites are treated with greater Civility and Attention
                            than in any other Country in Africa. They are provided with Houses and Provisions 
                            on their Journey at the King's Expence, The travelling Arabs, called malayes, are also
                            treated with great Respect; and the Black Messengers from neighbouring States are treated
                            with Attention, and are protected. Being aksed, Whether upon the Arrival of any White
                            Trader in the Captial of the Kindom, these Executins take place, and to what Extent?
                            Mr. Norris said, he never saw less than Six decollated Heads strewed in the Passage leading to
                            the King's apartment when he has been there.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris being asked, Whether he knew any Thing of the Countires bordering on Dahomey,
                            particularly inland? replied, He did, and from Accounts he had heard from Hundreds 
                            of People, the Government of Eyo is the same. He cannot say from his own Knowledge 
                            what becomes of Prisoners and Delinquents in the Eyo Country, but believes they are treated
                            as they are at Dahomey. The Eyo Slave Merchant sells his Slaves to the Slave Dealers
                            of Dahomey. The latter has submitted to pay Tribute to Eyo, and there has not been any
                            War between them for a Period of Thirty or Forty Years past. Mahee, on the other Side of 
                            Dahomey, is a Union of confederate States, and a Species of Republic. It is a Sort of feudal
                            Government; the leading Men have Vassals or Slaves, but they do not treat them in the same 
                            savage Way in which they are treated at Dahomey. The Governors or Leading Men at
                            Mahee sell their Slaves in great Numbers, as well as the Traders of Eyo, to the Dahomey
                            Factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris's Account of the Government, Manners, and Customs, of Dahomey and Whydah
                            having been read to Mr. Devaynes, and the Question put to him, How far that Account
                            agreed with what might have fallen withinhis own Observation? Mr. Devaynes differed with
                            Mr. Norris in Opinion in sme Particulars as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Respecting the Executions, and the making Human Sacrifices on certain Days of Ceremony,
                            Mr. Devaynes in general confirms the Account diven by Mr. Norris, but observes,
                            that the Performance of the Ceremony of Human Sacrifices does not take place on Occasion
                            of the Payment of the Poll Tax (which does not exist), but when the King buries his Father
                            and Mother again (as the Ceremony is called), which is generally about Crhistmas. On this
                            Occasion, about Sixty Men and Women, besides all Kinds of Animals, are put to death, and
                            sent to the deceased, in order that he or she may remain quiet, and not trouble the King; Promise
                            is made by a Cryer, in the Name of the King, that these Sacrifices shall be continued:
                            The Riches of the King are carried, covered, in Procession, in which the King's Women
                            (sometimes to the Amount of Three Thousand) appear: Goods are distributed to the Populace,
                            which are thrown from a high Platform to be scrambled for. Mr. Devaynes attended Ten of
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            these Ceremonies himself. The King lives in his Palace, which stands on a Space of near Three
                            Miles, attended only by Women, some of whom are armed. The King's Great Officers crawl
                            towards him, rubbing their Faces on the Ground, and never rise in his Presence.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to what is stated by Mr. Norris, that these Executions take Place on the Arrival of
                            any White Trader, Mr. Devaynes says, that White People are treated with great Respect; but he
                            is of Opinion, that Mr. Norris must have been at Dahomey at the Time of the Ceremony of 
                            watering the Graves. Mr. Devanes has occasionally, on visiting the King, seen Two or Three
                            Heads lying in the Palace, but does not think the Number of Persons put to Death in his Time
                            was near so many as is mentioned by Mr. Norris. These consisted of Persons sacrificed on Occasion
                            of the Ceremony of watering the Graves of the King's Ancestors; or Prisoners taken in War;
                            or of Delingquents of Note. If a Man happens to fall down on the Space before the King's
                            Palace, which may be about 400 or 500 Yards, they cut his Head off immediately, as they suppose
                            he must have some disloyal Thoughts in his Head to make him fall on level Ground. All
                            Messengers going to and from the King constantly run.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Persons destined for the Executions having undergone any Form of Trial,
                            Mr. Devaynes does not believe that tye do undergo any Sort of Trial, though there may be
                            some sort of Examination. When the Queen's Mother died, he was present when One of the
                            great Officers was taken to be put to Death in order to wait upon her as a Mark of Respect. He
                            does not recollect that any one of the King's great Officers, during the Time he was there, died a
                            natural Death. When the King wishes to get rid of One of them, he says to his Colleagues, what
                            he does not like his Face, or wish to see him again, which is the Expression used, as that of Blood
                            or Death is always avoided in Presence of the King. In consequence of this they take care to put
                            him to Death. There is nothing these People will not do to get into Office, notwithstanding the
                            almost absolute Certainty of Death attending it. They are a happy People, and have greaat
                            Contempt for the Subjects of the neighbouring Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Reason assigned by Mr. Norris, why the Number of Human Sacrifices
                            is sometimes diminished viz. that if the King of Dahomey is overstocked with Powder and other
                            Articles, not wanting Slaves for the Purchase of themn, he puts to Death a greater Number,
                            considering it as Part of his Power and Magnificence; Mr. Devaynes does not think it possible
                            to ascertain the Motives the King may have for putting his Subjects to Death. He believes
                            that when the King wants Eupopean Goods, he sometimes seizes Part of a Village and sells them
                            for Slaves under some frivolous Pretence or other; his Subjects do not however consider this as
                            any great Hardship, as they are all his Slaves and Property,
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to Prisoners of War being always put to Death unless sold for Slaves, Mr. 
                            Devaynes observed that in War the old, the lame, and the wounded are often put to Death
                            on the Spot, to save the Trouble of bringing them away; the young and the healthy, if not
                            immediately sold, are kept for another market, and are sometimes used as House Slaves. The
                            Women Prisoners are never put to Death, but when not sold, are always used as House Slaves.

                        <p>The Nature of the Government at <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, which is a Province conquered by the King of
                            <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>, and governed by a Viceroy, is despotic in the highest Degree. With respect to any civil
                            Rights enjoyed by the People of this Country, there are certain <distinct rend="italic" type="ethnographic">Customs</distinct> which <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> believes
                            the King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> would not willingly break through, although he has the Power: He consults 
                            with One or Two of his principal Men, but is in general Master of the Lives and Property of his
                            Subjects. At their Death, their Wives, Property, and all go to the King; but he sometimes
                            restores it to those of the Family whom he finds meritorious.
                        </p>
                        <p>The King, in order to maintain his Authority over his Subjects, at the End of every Year,
                            makes what they call <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>. At this Period the Governors of the respective Provinces of the
                            Kingdom are called to the Capital, and their Conduct examined into: If they have behaved ill
                            they are punished, generally with Death; if well, they are dismissed with Presents. Upon this
                            Occasion the Governors of the Three Forts. viz. <name>French</name>, <name>English</name>, and <name>Portuguese</name>, are invited.
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> attended as Governor of the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Fort in order to pay the King the annual Present
                            of the <orgName>African Committee</orgName>, consisting of <ecda:commodity>Silk</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity> &amp;c. to the Value of about 50L for which
                            he makes a Return of nearly the same Value, which is generally a Slave, and some of the Manufactures
                            of the Country. He is also very liberal to all their Attendants; they are lodged in their
                            Passage to the Capital by the King's Order, and in an House set apart for them at the Capital.
                            During his Stay there, which has sometimes been for three Weeks or upwards, <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> had
                            Opportunities of observing the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>, which he explained as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Every Fourth Day is their Market Day, and may perhaps be called their Sunday, for it is a Day
                            of Rest and Recreation, and of superstitious Ceremony.  On these Days during the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> there is
                            always some Kind of publick Exhibition going on. For instance, One Day is set apart for the
                            killing of Cattle, which Day in general is a Day previous to the Market Day. The <ecda:food>Meat</ecda:food>, being 
                            in very large Quantity, is dressed by the King's Women, and a large Quantity of the <ecda:food>Beer</ecda:food> of the 
                            Country is likewise brewed by the same People. This <ecda:food>Beer</ecda:food> is made of <ecda:flora><rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> or Guinea Corn</ecda:flora>.
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            The Meat and Drink is put into clean Baskets, covered with a Cloth, and carried about on the
                            Market Day in Procession by the Women, dressed in their best Cloaths; it is then distributed to
                            the Publick; every one that pleases may come and eat and drink. A large Camp is pitched for
                            the principal Men, who eat a Portion of the above Provision apart from the common People.
                        </p>
                        <p>On another of these Market Days the diversion consists in Singing and Dancing, ant which the
                            Governors of the Forts, the King, and principal People attend. There are professed Singers,
                            whose Songs are extempore, generally in Prase of the King's warlike Exploits; and when he
                            is pleased, he makes the Singers a Present of a Bunch of Cowries; and when very much pleased,
                            as on one Occasion <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> saw him, he made the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="performer">Performer</ecda:anonPers> a Present of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Woman</ecda:anonPers> with
                            a <ecda:anonPers>Child</ecda:anonPers> at her Back.

                        <p>Another of these market Days is allotted to the Distribution of Presents. A large Stage is  <!-- not sure if I should make the person at the end of this ¶ an anonPers? -->
                            erected contiguous to the King's House, covered with the Cloths of the Country, and adorned with
                            Flags and Umbrellas. A Fence of Thorns is placed round the Stage at some little Distance to
                            keep of the Rabble. The Stage is laoded with a Profusion of Cowries, Manufactures of the
                            Country, and European Goods. At a certain Time the King appears and orders his different
                            Viceroys, according to their Rank, to chuse a Piece of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Cloth, or the Cloth of the
                            Country, together with a String of large Coral; which done, the King takes a Bunch of Cowries
                            with his own Hands, and throws to the Rabble beyond the Fence. The <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Governors,
                            And the other upon the Stage, follow the King's Example, and throw the Whole among the People 
                            who scramble for it, and carry away what they can get; after this, a Man tied, an <ecda:fauna>Alligator</ecda:fauna>
                            tied, a pair of <ecda:fauna>Pigeons</ecda:fauna> also tied, were thrown from the Stage; all of which, as <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> was
                            informed, were put to Death by the People below.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the whole of the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> always found, upon going to the King's House,
                            Heads that appeared to have been fresh cut off; and he has seen, perhaps, about Twenty of those
                            Victims at a Time, previous to their Execution, whom he conceives to have been Men who had
                            been made Prisoners of War or Slaves.—These were tied to Stakes, and exhibited for a Day or
                            more before their execution, which he presumes was done in the Night. He has been desired to
                            go and see it, but never would. He has enquired into the Reason ofthese Executions, and though
                            the People are reserved on this Subject, het he has been told, that they have an Idea of a future
                            of the King in another World; and these Victims are so resigned to their Fate, that <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName>
                            himself observed One of them who was tied to the Stake make Efforts to dance at the Sound of
                            the Music; and he cannot say, as far as he observed, that they appeared to be intoxicated. They
                            also sacrifice <ecda:fauna>Horses</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>Mules</ecda:fauna> on the same Occasion, and probably with the same View.
                        </p>
                        <p>These <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> are repeated once a Year only; and <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> does not know that any but
                            the King performs this Ceremony. He cannot speak as to the Number of People sacrificed on these
                            Occasions, but conceives it to be considerable; he has also seen Numbers of Skulls on the Top of
                            the King's Palace, and also on the Pavement of it. No Subject ventures to approach the King
                            without giving Notice by one of the Eunuchs, of whom there are Ten or Twelve, or by one of 
                            the King's Women, of which there are not so few as Two Thousand. When admitted to his
                            Presence, they approach groveling on their Hands and Knees, and throwing Dust over their Heads,
                            His principal Ministers do the same. When Europeans  or Messengers from the Foreign Countires
                            approach the King, they are allowed to salute him according to the Manner of their respective
                            Countries. Every Stranger carries a Linguist, but that Linguist is obliged to communicate what
                            is said to one of the Ministers who is always present, as it is below the Dignity of the King to
                            take Words from the Mouth of the Linguist. The distinguishing Part of the King's Dress is
                            wearing Sandals. There are Centinels at the outward Doors of the Palace which is a vast Wall of
                            Mud; inclosing a Space as big as <placeName>St. James's Park</placeName>; but no Male is allowed to reside within the
                            Walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Religion of the People at <placeName>Whydah</placeName> and the general Object of their Worship,
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> observed that in no Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> had be been able to understand the Religion of the
                            Natives. At <placeName>Whydah</placeName> they pay a Kind of Veneration to a particular Species of large Snake, which
                            is very gentle. In <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> they pay the same Kind of Veneration to Tygers. This Veneration
                            does not prevent People from catching and killing them if they please, but they must not touch
                            the Beard, which is considered a great Offence. They have a great Number of Men they call
                            <distinct type="religious" rend="italic">Fetiche</distinct> Men, or Padres. The Word Fetiche is derived from a <rs type="properAdjective">Portugueze</rs> Word meaning
                            Witchcraft.

                        <p>The Government of <placeName>Bonny</placeName> extends only over the Town, and a small District on each Side the
                            River. It is a Monarchy elective and not hereditary. The Election is made out of One of the
                            Families of Royal Blood. It is a limited Monarchy, and no Resolution of consequence is
                            taken, either in civil or military Matters, respecting Peace or War, but by the Advice of a
                            Council composed of the Principal People of the Country, of which Two are Priests. At the
                            Coronation of the King, One of these Priests with other religious Ceremonies, places the Cap,
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            which is a Symbol of Royalty, on his Head. The Priests do not take their own Names, but the
                            Name of the Deity whose Priests they are, and the Natives swear by them. They are not suffered
                            to trade, but ar supported by Government. They live in a separate Town, which is a Sanctuary
                            and Place of Refuge for Griminals and Debtors. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> was at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> at the Time of a 
                            contested Election for a King, and after some Contest, the defeated Party took Refuge there from
                            the Resentment of the prevailing one. They hold the <ecda:fauna>Guana</ecda:fauna>, a Species of Lizard, sacred at
                            <placeName>Bonny</placeName>. They offer human Sacrifices to the Manes of their King. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> was present at a
                            Ceremony of this Sort, where <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved">a young Slave</ecda:anonPers> was sacrificed with great Pomp, and with other
                            Animals. To give a further Sanction to the Measures taken, there are Twelve old Men, who
                            are appointed by the King and Nobles, and are generally consulted. These are called <orgName>Parliament
                            Gentlemen</orgName>. Disputes that arise in Matters of Trade between the Whites and Blacks, are
                            generally referred to these old Men.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Government of the Countries adjoining to <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> can only speak 
                            from Report. No <name>European</name> has ever resided at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> on Shore, or been there, except on Ship
                            board for the Purpose of Trade. In the Country on the Sea Coast to the Eastward of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>,
                            called <placeName>Andomey</placeName>, the Government and Laws are similar to those of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>. To the Westard in
                            the Country called <placeName>Creek</placeName>, the People are considered as barbarous, and held in Abhorrence by
                            their Neighbours, as they are charged with being Cannibals. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not know what the
                            Government there is; the interior Part of the Country from whence the Bulk of the Slaves are
                            received, and which is of vast Extent, called <placeName>Ebo</placeName>, and another Country bordering on it to the
                            East, called <placeName>Ebibee</placeName>, from the concurrent Testimony of the best informed Traders who have been
                            in that Country, are divided into a Number of petty States, governed by despotic Princes independent
                            of each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being aksed, Whether the Subjects of Ebo and Ebibee have any civil Rights? Mr. Penny
                            replied, The Princes are despotic, and have the Command of the Lives and Properties of all
                            their Subjects, excepting only those of their own Family.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Religion of these Countries is idolatrous. In their Houses they have Idols of different
                            Sorts, some representing Men, and some Animals. They have no <name>Mahometans</name> amongst them.
                            <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> conceives that they belive in a future state, and in a good an bad Supreme Deity,
                            with a Number of inverior Deities under them. They place at the End of every Town a small
                            Quantity of Provision and Water as an Offereing to the bad Deity; and when they commit any
                            bad Action, they impute it to the bad Deity, who they say took Possession of them. This 
                            Account applies principally to the interior Country, but at <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, the Religion is nearly similar,
                            except that the Priests have amuch greater Influence there than in the interior Country.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> attributes it to their Intercourse with the Europeans, that the Governments on the
                            Coast appear to be in general more free than in the interior Country; the only Exceptions thereto,
                            are the Countries of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> and <placeName>Benin</placeName>, which extend to the Sea Coast. He has observed, that
                            in the monarchical Governments, where there is a stronger Government to protect them, the Lives
                            and the Properties of Strangers are more secure than in the Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government of <placeName>New Calabar</placeName> is nearly similar to that of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, except that the King is
                            a mere Pageant. The Power chiefly resides in the principal Traders, who govern very much in
                            the King's Name. There is <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a Man</ecda:anonPers> there called <distinct rend="italic">Anachree</distinct>, who has more Influence and Wealth
                            than all the rest of the Community, though he himself is a purchased Slave brought from the
                            <placeName>Braspan Country</placeName>; he has offered the Price of a hundred Slaves for his Freedom, but, according
                            to the Laws of the Country he cannot obtain it, though <ecda:anonPers>his Master</ecda:anonPers>, who is an obscure, and a poor
                            Individual, would gladly let him have it. It is contrary to a fundamental Law of the Country that
                            a purchased Slave should become free, and the Priests, who are Interpreters and Guardians of the
                            Laws are afraid, if it should be permitted in the Case of this Man, of establishing a dangerous
                            Precedent. It is a small Country and they are apprehensive that the purchased Slaves, if emancipated, 
                            should make themsleves Masters of it. Notwithstanding the great Influence and Wealth
                            of this Man, his Power is, in many Instances, restrained by his Condition of Slavery.

                        <p>Of the Government of this Country, <persName>Captain Hall</persName> gives the following Account.</p>
                        <p>The Business of the Town at the <placeName>River Del Rey</placeName> appeared to be managed by the old Men.
                            They had a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King</ecda:anonPers>, who was absolute, but he always availed himself of the Advice of these <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="council">old
                            Men</ecda:persGroup>, who were his Council.
                        </p>
                        <p>At <placeName>Calabar</placeName> they had Three Kings, one of which had the Civil Government, the other was at the
                            Head of the Religion, and the third at the Head of the Law. Private Disputes were settled by
                            the Head of the Law. Matters of Greater Consequence were settled by the Three Kings with the
                            Elders of the Country. They have no written Law.
                        </p>
                        <p>They have no Money in this Country; Copper Rods about Fifteen Inches long are substituted
                            for Money. They have no Taxes, and no Army. They never were in actual War while he was
                            there, but he saw them making Preparation for War, either to resist Encroachments, or against
                            their Rivals in Trade, which consists of Slaves and a little <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>. He does not believe any Wars
                            are entered into upon the Sea Coast for the Purpose of making Slaves. In the Year <date when="1768">1768</date>, there
                            was a very violent War, and the Slaves made in it were all either sold or massacred, and none remained in
                            the Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Cause of this violent War was this: There was a New Town on the River Calabar, settled
                            from the Old Town. This Town became considerable, and grew to be a Rival in Trade to the
                            Old Town. In the Year <date when="1786">1786</date>, there were Seven Ships which lay at the Point which separated the
                            Two Towns. The Two of these belonged to <placeName>London</placeName>, and the other Five to <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. Trade
                            was very slack, and hardly any Slaves were to be purchased, from the Jealousy that subsisted between
                            the Two Towns, which made it unsafe for Parties to go into the Country. The Captains
                            of the <placeName type="properAdjective">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName type="properAdjective">Bristol</placeName> Ships agreed to invite on board their Ships the People of both Towns,
                            in order to bring about a Reconciliation; at the same Time they entered into an Agreement with
                            the People of the New Town to cut off all the Old Town People the Day they met on board. So
                            perfectly satisfied were the Old Town People of the Sincerity of the Captains of the Ships to bring
                            about a Reconciliation, that the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King of the Old Town</ecda:anonPers> gave his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Daughter</ecda:anonPers> to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Wife</ecda:anonPers> to the principal
                            Trader of the New Town. The next Morning at Eight o'Clock, one of the Ships fired a Gun
                            as a Signal to the others, when the Crews on board the other Ships made an Attempt to secure
                            all the Old Town People; those who resisted were put to Death by the Captains and Seamen of
                            the Ships.—Immediately after the Firing commenced, the New Town Canoes, which were lying
                            in Ambush behind the Point, came forward, and took up those who had jumped overboard, belonging
                            to the Old Town. After this the New Town People went along-side the different Ships,
                            Four of Which delivered up the Prisoners they had made to the New Town Canoes. The principal
                            Men of Old Town were put to Death in the Canoes by the New Town People; the lower
                            Class Prisoners were sold to the Ships as Slaves. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="captain">One Captain</ecda:anonPers>, who had secured <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">Two of the
                            King's Brothers</ecda:persGroup>, refused to deliver them up, till his Ship was supplied with Slaves; and when his
                            Ship was supplied, which was very soon, from the Number of Prisoners taken, he told the principal
                            Man of New Town that he would not deliver them up, but would carry them off the Coast, 
                            which he did.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">Two Brothers of the King</ecda:persGroup> were sold in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; but some Means or other they got
                            to <placeName>America</placeName>, (to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> or <placeName>Maryland</placeName>), from thence they got to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, where they were taken
                            up, and put on board-Ship to be sent back to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Jones</persName>, an <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Merchant
                            in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, who had Ships trading to <placeName>Old Calabar</placeName>, got them taken out of the Ship by a 
                            Habeas Corpus, and they were returned in one of the Ships to <placeName>Old Calabar</placeName>, after an Absence of
                            Five or Six Years, while <persName>Captain Hall</persName> was there. The <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King of Old Town</ecda:anonPers> was fortunate enough
                            to make his Escape by killing <ecda:persGroup>Two of the Ship's Crew</ecda:persGroup>, who first endeavoured to seize him. He
                            then got into a little Canoe, called a One Man Canoe; One of the Ships fired a Gun at the Canoe
                            and broke it in two; he then swam on Shore, and got into the Wood opposite the Ship. He
                            was about three Miles off, where he was attended by the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="surgeon">Surgeon of the London Ships</ecda:anonPers>. This was
                            the Commencement of the War, which lasted three or four Years.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Account given by the <ecda:anonPers a-status="freed" a-gender="male">King's Brothers</ecda:anonPers> of their Treatment in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, was, that they
                            had not been treated well there; but were well used in <placeName>America</placeName>. 
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Hall</persName> being asked, if the <name>English</name> were as well received at the Old Town after the

                        <p>The Government of the Country from <placeName>Congo</placeName> to <placeName>Angola</placeName> is limited Monarchy. In the Kingdoms
                            of <placeName>Loango</placeName>, <placeName>Melimba</placeName>, and <placeName>Cabenda</placeName>, which are on the Coast, the Inheritance goes in the female
                            Line; that is, the Sons of the Daughters only succeed. A Princess in this Country is invested
                            with a great Power, and may marry whom she pleases. In this she is not influenced by Affection
                            but selects some Freeman who is become rich by his Talents and Industry in Trade, and who is
                            enabled better to administer to her Extravagance, and the more effectually to support her
                            Dignity. She does not even consult this Person until her Messengers announce to him the Princess's
                            Resolution of the Honour she intents of making him her Husband, which is generally received
                            with Reluctance, and sometimes with Horror; for he must for ever quit his Home, his Wives,
                            and Children. The only Consolation he has is, that he becomes a Prince; and to distinguish such
                            Person from a Prince born, he is denominated a Catched Prince; a Guard is appointed him, partly
                            as an Appendage to his new Dignity, and partly as a Watch over his Actions; such Guard
                            being the Creatures of his Wife the Princess, should he be so imprudent as to have any
                            Commerce with his former Wives, or any other Women, Death would be the immediate Consequence,
                            while the Princess is left at large without Controul, and often carries on her Amours without any
                            Regard to Decency; nor dare her Husband complain.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Manner in which these Monarchies are limited is as follows:</p>
                        <p>There is a Council of Princes of the Blood Royal, whom the King is bound to consult on all
                            Occasions, and there are Two great Officers of State who are principally concerned in the 
                            Government of the Country. The one having the Direction of the interior Country, and the other Prince
                            that of the Sea Coast and Trade; the former is called the King's Mongoba, and the other Prince
                            Mambooka. There is another Officer called the Mamfooka, who is the Governor at the Place
                            where the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Factories are established, but who is subject to the Controul of the Prince
                            Mambooka beforementioned. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> speaks from his own Knowledge with respect to the Laws of his
                            Country, is not permitted to see the Sea, nor to wear any Manufactures of any Country but his
                            own, nor to have any Thing to do with Trade; but through the Mongoba he receives certain
                            Customs upon the Trade of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>From <placeName>Cape Lopez</placeName> to <placeName>Angola</placeName> the Extent is about 140 Leagues. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> cannot positively
                            say what is the Extent of the Three Kingdoms before mentioned, <emph>inland</emph>, but believes it may be
                            from 200 to 300 miles. He cannot say any Thing positively with respect to the Nature of the
                            Government in any of the interior Countries bordering on the said Three Kingdoms, but understands
                            that they are divided into Petty States, governed by Princes, with the Nature of whose Authority
                            he is not much acquainted.
                        </p>
                        <p ana="#religion">With respect to the religious Institutions of these Kingdoms, the People believe in a good and
                            bad Deity: They have some few Images, but he never understood they worshipped them; he rather
                            believes they are considered as Charms or Amulets. They bury their Princes with great Pomp and
                            Lamentation, consuming a great Variety of their Effects, and the Trinkets of the deceased, but
                            they have not any human Sacrifices; the lower Orders of the People follow this Example as far as 
                            their Circumstances permit. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has never observed them to pray, and the Reason they
                            assign for do not doing so is, <said rend="italic">that God knows what is best for them</said>.

                                their Masters, with what are they fed, and in what Quantity?
                            </p>
                            <p>By the Laws of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, every Proprietor is obliged to allot one Acre of good Provision
                                Ground to every Four Negroes belongin to him: this is meant for their own private Cultivation:
                                And besides this, the Negroes have in all the Plantations an unbounded Liberty to
                                cultivate as much Land as they please. But as the major Part of them are improvident and
                                negligent, there are few, if any, Estates, the Owners or Managers of which do not keep a
                                large Tract of Ground constantly stocked with some or other of the various vegetable Species,
                                such as <ecda:flora ana="#food">Plantains</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Yams</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Cocoa</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Potatoe</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Cassavi</ecda:flora>, &amp;c.; and who also take every seasonable

                            </p>
                            <p>In addition to these, every well regulated Estate imports <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Herrings</ecda:food> or Salt Fish, or both
                                <ecda:food>Flour</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>Pease</ecda:food>. Twenty or Twenty-five Barrels of Herrings to every One Hundred Negroes
                                (including all Ages) is the common Allowance.
                            </p>
                            <p>Every industrious Negroe breeds <ecda:fauna>Hogs</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>Poultry</ecda:fauna> for his own and Family Use, or for
                                Sale, and for his own Benefit. These Articles support amonst them a very extensive and
                                lucrative Commerce, which they carry on uninterruptedly, as well with the King's Ships and
                                Troops on that Station, as with the Shipping in genera. the Towns, and the Country
                                Markets, and Platnations, by which Means these Negro Slaves are possessed of Nine-tenths
                                at least (or nearly the Whole) of the smaller Silver Currency (rials and Pistarins) now in the
                                Island; nor has there existed an Example within our Knowledge, that the Owners of such 
                                Negroes have deprived them of any Part of such their Acquisitions, which by long Practice
                                and Usage are universally considered as their own Property, Right, or <distinct rend="italic">Peculium</distinct>, which they
                                keep or dispose of, and devise at their own Pleasure. And some there are, who are rich
                                enough to purchase their Freedom, if they were of opinion it would render their Condition
                                more comfortable and happy than it is at present.

                            <p>Slaves employed in the Culture of Lands are allowed by their Masters certain Proportions
                                of Land, which they cultivate for their own Support and Maintenance. These Lands are
                                for the most part found equal to support and sustain the Slaves to whom they are respecively
                                allotted; and, excepting the Time of Crop, they are allowed, in general, One Day in every
                                Fortnight (independent of Sundays) for the Purpose of cultivating them. In addition to this,
                                they are, in general, served weekly, or once a Fortnight, with <ecda:food>Herrings</ecda:food>, or other Salt Fish,
                                after the Rate of a Herring or other such Fish per Day: They are also allowed Slat as they
                                have occasion to ask for it. Where Lands cannot be allowed them, or where they are inadequate, 
                                or when they seasones happen to fail, the Master furnishes his Slaves, in general, with
                                <ecda:food>Corn</ecda:food>, at the Rate of about Six Quarts per Week, or an adequate Supply in <ecda:food>Flour</ecda:food>, besides
                                the said usual Supply of Salt Herrings, or other salted Fish: Domestics and Tradesmen, who
                                are employed in and about the Towns, or have no Connexion with Plantations, are in general,
                                if not universally, at Board-wages. The late <title>Consolidated Slave Act</title> furnishes also an

                            <p>Vide Appendix to this Head. Act 38. 1696. Sec. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                            <p>The general Clothing in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is what is called Osnaburgh Linen. On every well-
                                regulated Estate, the annual Allowance is from Ten to Twenty Yards to every Man; from
                                Seven to fifteen Yards to every Woman; and in proportion to the younger People. To
                                every Negro, a Worsted Cap, Bonnet, or Hat, besides a Woollen Jacket, or Welch Blanket,
                                to the Men; a Petticoat and Blanket to the Women. The Petticoat is on many Estates
                                of Perptuana; a Quantity of common Check Linen is given on some Estates to the
                                principal Negroes, such as Boilers, Drivers, Waggoners, and Tradesmen; and several of our
                                Planters furnish Handkerchiefs, Knives, Scissars, Thread, Needles, and short Tobacco Pipes.
                                The Jamaica Law enjoins sufficient Clothing to be given, and inflicts a Penalty on such
                                Owners as disobey that Injunction. In general, the Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> are well clothed; and
                                there are very few Sugar Estates where the Negroes do not, from their own private Earnings,
                                provide themselves with extra Clothes for Sundays and Holidays.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Negro Slaves on the Plantations in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, in general (except the calamitous Years),
                                raise more Provisions than they can consume. They carry the Overplus to Market,
                                and commonly lay out the Money they receive for it in Fineries, or in <ecda:commodity>Salt Beef</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Pork</ecda:commodity> or
                                <ecda:commodity>Fish</ecda:commodity>, and sometimes in <ecda:commodity>Spiritous Liquors</ecda:commodity>. Before a Planter makes a Purchase of imported

                                and most Planters also give them a Breed of Hogs and Poultry.
                            </p>
                            <p>The established Negro Slaves lie in Houses perfectly convenient to themselves, and
                                adapted to the Climate; the Size is proportioned to their Rank and Family. When they 
                                require to be rebuilt or enlarged, sufficient Time, Materials, and Assistance are allowed
                                them for those Purposes. Upon the whole, we believe them to be far better clothed, lodged,
                                and fed in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, than the Peasantry of <placeName>Europe</placeName> in general.

                                the Practice: Slaves employed in Husbandry are usually allowed annually Tow Osnaburgh
                                Frocks, and Two Pair of Osnaburgh Trowsers, with an Hat or Woollen Bonnet to each Man;
                                and to each Woman, Two Shifts and Two Petticoats of Osnaburgh, and a Hat; and to each,
                                whether Man or Woman, a Piece of Woollen Cloth or Blanketing. Drivers, or principal
                                Negroes, are usually allowed a double Proportion of each, with a Check Shirt to the Men of

                                and Workmen are clothed as in England in the Summer Time.

                            <p>Slaves employed in Husbandry are lodged on the Master's Land, in separate Houses,
                                from about Twenty to Twenty-four Feet in Length, and from Ten to Twelve, or Fourteen
                                broad, and which, if they are themselves unable to erect, their Masters build for them.
                                These Houses are in general thatched, wattled, and plaistered, are found a very sufficient 
                                Protection against the most inclement Seasons, and are for the most Part full as commodious as the

                            <p>This Question is not properly applicable to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; for in this Island, as the Negroes in all

                                Produce of which, together with an Allowance of Herring or other Salt Fish, Sugar and Rum,

                            <p>Till within these Twelve or Fourteen Years, a few Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> were let out to hire,
                                except Domestics and Tradesmen.—But in consequence of some Discouragements which the 
                                Article <ecda:commodity>Coffee</ecda:commodity> met with, most of the Coffee Planters began to let out their working Negroes
                                upon Job Work, on the Sugar Estates.
                            </p>
                            <p>This Business has ever since been followed pretty extensively in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, both by the inferior
                                Settlers, and such Overseers of Sugar-works, who have from time to time become Owners of
                                Negroes, but not yet possessed of Land of their own, or who have not applied themselves to the

                            </p>
                            <p>The Planters have many of them adopted this Practice, both on account of the very advanced
                                Proce of imported Negroes, and from the Principle of easing and assisting their own People
                                in the several Parts of their Annual Labour.

                            </p>
                            <p>Other Operations have their respective usual Prices, as planting Guinea Grass, 5 l. per Acre,

                            </p>
                            <p>We do not know that it is usual in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, with any Planters in tolerable Circumstances, to
                                hire Negroes for any other Operation in the annual Cane Culture and Manufacture, except 
                                holeing and planting, and sometimes taking off the Crop.

                            <p>Slaves are frequently hired out; those employed by Day Work in Husbandry, usually at
                                1 s. 10½ d. per Day; those by the Year at 12 l. or 15 l. per Annum, or at a Rate per Cent. on

                                In the two latter Instances, the Slaves so hired usually remain on the Land where they are
                                hired to work, and are clothed, lodged, and supported in like Manner as the other Slaves
                                on the Plantation.

                                afflicted with it, die notwithstanding the ablest medical Assistance.—As to other Distempers,
                                it is not pretended that Negroe Slaves are naturally more subject to them than the White
                                Inhabitants or Free Negroes; what Difference is observable between them in this Respect, is 
                                chiefly to be attributed to <emph>Manners</emph>.—Numbers of the Negroe Slaves in that Island either
                                perish or are rendered Invalits by Fevers, Fluxes, and Pleurisies, occasioned by their Habit of
                                rambling to what are called <distinct rend="italic">Negro Plays</distinct> or nocturnal Assemblies, in distant Parts, where
                                they dance immoderately, drink to Excess, sleep on the damp Ground in open Air, and
                                commit such Acts of Sensuality and Intemperance, as bring on the most fatal Distempers.
                                No Causes, perhaps, more impede the natural Increase of the Slaves than these; the Women
                                catch Cold; their natural Periods are obstructed; they have Commerce too early in Life, even
                                at the Age of Nine, and with a Multitude of Men; and both Sexes studiously conceal
                                Infection with the venereal Taint, unil it becomes almost irremediable. The Negroes, both
                                Men and Women, most studiously endeavour to conceil their Infection with this Disorder,
                                either considering it as reproachful to them, or the Necessity of abstaining from Pleasure 
                                during the medicinal Course as an intolerable Punishment.

                            <p>What Care is taken of the Slaves in Sickness? Are there any Laws or Regulations for that
                                Purpose? What Provision is made for them when old or disbaled; and are their Masters
                                obliged, in such Cases, to maintain them?
                            </p>
                            <p>On every Estate is an Hospital (commonly called there a Hot-house) where the sick Negroes
                                are attended by a Doctor. In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, the Doctor's pay is 5 s. per Head per Annum,
                                which includes the Charge of Medicine and Attendance, for every Negro belonging to the
                                Estate; he is paid <emph>extra</emph> for chirugical Operations, such as Fractures, Inoculation, and
                                Drugs and Medicines from <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>. Disabled and superannuated Slaves, in that Island,
                                are cloathed subsisted, and in every respect treated with the same Care as other Slaves;
                                such is the Practice.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Laws are silent upon this Subject. As to the Old and Disabled, the <placeName type="properAdjective">Jamaica</placeName> Laws
                                have no special Direction, but only enact, that every Person manumitting a Slave, shall give
                                Security for paying such a freed Slave an Annuity of 5 l. for Life. Act passed in <date when="1774">1774</date>. But
                                Quere if the Allowance be not, by <emph>subsequent Act</emph>, raised to 10 l. per Annum.
                            </p>
                            <p>An Hospital is provided for the Sick, and a Doctor is appointed to attend it; which he does
                                Two or Three Times a Week as of course, and oftner if Necessity requires. The Hospital is
                                properly provided with <ecda:commodity>Medicines</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Wine</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Sago</ecda:commodity>, &amp;c. When the Negroes become old or disabled,
                                their masters are obliged by Law to maintain them. For the Particulars in this Respect,
                                the Committee refer to the <title>Consolidated Slave Act</title>.<milestone unit="absent" xml:id="anaEnd01"/>

                            <p>What is the general Period of the Lives of Negro Slaves? Is it of equal Duration with
                                that of White Inhabitants, or Free Negroes?
                            </p>
                            <p>The Duration fo their Lives (meaning the Native Blacks) is in general equal to that of the
                                Free Negroes, and longer than that of the Whites. But, in considering this Question, due Regard
                                must be had to local Differences of Situation. The lowest Situations, such as Vallies,
                                and the Banks of Rivers and Lagoons, are the most unhealthy; and in such Situations in
                                general, the Negroes will every be found the most distempered, sickly, and short-lived. The
                                Native Slaves, if industrious and sober, in general attain to the more common Periods of human
                                Life: The Women in general outlive the Men. As great Part of the Sugar Estates are
                                Lowlands, the Whites as well as the Blacks are subject to the same Inconveniencies in point of
                                Health, if they live at their Works. There is no Doubt but the Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, whether
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                Free or Slaves, would live healthier, and for a much longer Term than they do in general,
                                if it were not for their vicious and irregular Practices.
                            </p>
                            <p>Many Negroes live to be old, some to the Age of One Hundred Years; the Period of
                                their Lives is, in general, of longer Duration that that of the Lives of the White Inhabitants
                                in this Climate. The Free Negroes (who, by the Labour of One or Two Days, may year na
                                Sufficiency to allow them to indulge in Irregularities, and remain idle the rest of the Week,
                                which they are universally disposed to be, and who are not so well taken care of in Sickness as
                                the Slaves are) seldom live so long as either the Whites or the Slaves.

                            <p>What is the Practice respecting the Marriage of Negro Slaves, and what are the Regulations
                                concerning it?
                            </p>
                            <p>If, by Marriage, is meant a regular Contract and Union of one Man with one Woman, enforced
                                by positive Institutions; no such Practice exists among the Slaves, and they are left entirely
                                free in this respect. But every prudent Planter encourages his Negroes to form their Connexions
                                upon his own Estate, as a Means of preventing them from rambling every Night to
                                Other Estates in the Neighbourhood, and of reducing them to a temperate and orderly Habit of
                                Life. The pregnant Woman has easy Work assigned her; at the Time of Parturition she is
                                attended by a Midwife, and for a Month by a careful Nurse, and. if the Case should require it,
                                by medical Assistance: She has also every Indulgence in Food proper for lying-in Women.
                                Few of these Women die of child-bed Fevers, but Miltitudes of Infants are carried off by
                                the Tetanus, or locked Jaw. The suckling Women are put to some gentle Work at a proper
                                Distance of Time after their Deliver. Their Infants are laid under Shelter, here they
                                are taken care of by One or more Dry-nurses, and the Mother comes frequently to give them
                                the Breast. Such as are Nurses have an extra Allowance out of the Stores. When the Children
                                are able to run about, they are usually brought up every Day at Noon to the Overseer's
                                House, to be served with Messes of Broth provided for them; and many are brought up in
                                Families, during Infancy, in the same Manner as White Children.

                            <p>They do not marry, they cohabit by mutual Cosent; they separate occasionally without much
                                Ceremony, but they much more frequently live and grow old together; when their Children
                                and Relations, through a strong Family Attachment that generally prevails amongst them, furnish
                                them with their Care and Assistance, in addition to that of their Masters.

                                where it is so universally practiced, tha we believe there are few of the larger Estates possessing
                                those who usually attract the greatest Devotion and Confidence, those whose hoary Heads,
                                and a somewhat peculiarly harsh and diaboloic in their Aspect, together with some Skill in
                                Plants of the medicinal and poisonous Species, have qualified them for successful imposition
                                upon the weak and credulous. The Negroes in general, whether <placeName>Africans</placeName> or <placeName>Creoles</placeName>, revere,
                                consult, and abhor them; to these Oracles they resort, and with the most implicit Faith, upon
                                all occasions, whether for the Cure of Disorders, and the obtaining Revenge for the Injuries or
                                Insults, the Conciliating of Favour, the Discovery and Punishment of the Thief or the
                                Adulterer, and the Prediction of future Events. The Trade with these Wretches carry on
                                at different Prices. A Veil of Mystery is studiously thrown over their Incantations, to
                                which the Midnight Hours are allotted, and every Precuation is taken to conceal them from
                                the Knowledge and Discovery of the White People. The deluded Negroes, who thoroughly
                                believe in their supernatural Power, become the willing Accomplices in this Concealment,
                                and the stoutest among them tremble at the very Sight of the ragged Bundle, the Bottle or
                                the Egg-shells, which are stuck in the Thatch or hung over the Door of a Hut, or upon the
                                Branch of a Plantain Tree, to deter Marauders. In Cases of Poison, the natural Effects of
                                it are by the ignorant Negroes ascribed entirely to the potent workings of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>. The
                                wiser Negroes hesitate to reveal their Suspicions, through a Dread of incurring the terrible
                                Vengeance which is fulminated by the <name rend="italic">Obiah-men</name> against any who should betray them; it is
                                very difficult therefore for the White Proprietor to distinguish the <distinct rend="italic">Obia Possessor</distinct> from any
                                other Negro upon his Plantation; and so infatuated are the Blacks in general, that but few
                                Instances occur of their having assumed Courage enough to impeach these Miscreants. With
                                Minds so firmly prepossessed, they no sooner find <name rend="italic">Obi</name> <emph>set for them</emph> near the Door of their
                                House, or in the Path which leads to it, than they give themselves up for lost. When a
                                Negro is robbed of a Fowl or a Hog, he applies directly to the <rs type="properAdjective">Obiah</rs>-Man or Woman; it
                                is then made known among his Fellow Blacks, that <distinct rend="italic"><name>Obi</name> is set</distinct> for the Thief; and as soon as
                                the latter hears the dreadful News, his terrified Imagination begins to work, no Resource is
                                left but in the superior Skill of some more eminent <name rend="italic">Obiah-Man</name> of the Neighbourhood,
                                who may counteract the magical Operations of the other; but if no one can be found
                                of higher Rank and Ability, or if after gaining such an Ally he should still fancy himself
                                affected, he presently falls into a Decline, under the incessant Horrour of impending Calamities.
                                The slightest painful Sensation in the Head, the Bowels, or any other Part, any
                                casual Loss or Hurt, confirms his apprehensions, and he belives himself the devoted 
                                Victim of an invisible and irresistible Agency. Sleep, Appetite, and Cheerfulness, forsake
                                him, his Strength decays, his disturbed Imagination is haunted without Respite, his Features
                                wear the settled Gloom of Despondency; Dirt, or any other unwholesome Substance, becomes
                                his only Food, he contracts morbid Habit of the Body, and gradually sinks into the Grave.
                                A Negro, who is taken ill, enquires of the <name rend="italic">Obiah-man</name> the Cause of his Sickness, whether
                                it will prove mortal or not, and within what Time he shall die or recover? The Oracle
                                generally ascribes the Distemper to the Malice of some particular Person by Name, and
                                advises to set <name rend="italic">Obi</name> for that Person; but if no Hopes are given of Recovery, immediate
                                Despair takes place, which no Medicine can remove, and Death is the certain Consequence.
                                Those anomalous Symptoms, which originate from Causes deeply rooted in the Mind, such
                                as the Terrours of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>, or from Poisons, whose Operation is slow and intricate, will baffle
                                the Skill of the ablest Physician.

                                have mentioned particular instances of it. The secret and insidious Manner in which

                                therefore have been frequent, but Detections rare: These Murderers have <emph>sometimes</emph>
                                been brought to Justice, but it is reasonable to believe that a far greater Number have
                                escaped with Impunity. In regard to the other and more common Tricks of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>, such as
                                hanging up Feathers, Bottles Eggshells, &amp;c. &amp;c. in order to intimidate Negroes of a theivish
                                Disposition from plundering Huts, Hog-styes, or Provision Grounds, these were laughted at by
                                the White Inhabitants as harmless Stratagems, contrived by the more sagacious for deterring
                                the more simple and superstitious Blacks, and serving for much the same Purpose as the
                                Scarecrows, which are in general used among our <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Farmers and Gardeners. But in the
                                Year 1760, when a very formidible Insurrection of the Cormantin or Gold Coast Negroes
                                broke out in the <placeName>Parish of St. Mary</placeName>, and spread through almost every other District of the 
                                Parish, who had administered the Fetish or solemn Oath to the Conspirators, and furnished 
                                them with a magical Preparation which was to render them invulnerable, was fortunately 
                                apprehended, convicted, and hung up with all his Feathers and Trumperies about him and
                                this Execution struck the Insurgents with a general Panic, from which they never afterwards
                                recovered. The Examinations which were taken at that period first opened the Eyes of
                                this Law, the strict Investigation which ever since been made after the Professors of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>,
                                nor the many Examples of those who from Time to Time have been hanged or transported,
                                like others in the World, has flourished under Persecution; or that fresh Supplies are annually
                                introduced from the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Seminaries.

                                    <p>Upon returning to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the Year <date when="1775">1775</date>, he found a great many of his Negroes had died
                                        during his Absence; and that of such as remained alive, at least One-half were debilitated,
                                        bloated, and in a very deplorable Condition. The Mortality continued after his Arrival, and
                                        Two or Three were frequently buried in One Day; others were taken ill, and began to decline
                                        under the same Symptoms. Every Means were tried by Medicines, and the most
                                        careful Nursing, to preseve the Lives of the feebles; but in spite of all his Endeavours,
                                        this Depopulation went on for above a Twelvemonth longer, with more or less Intermission,
                                        and without his being able to ascertain the real Cause, though the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct> was strongly
                                        suspected, as well by himself, as by the Doctor and other White Persons upon the Plantation,
                                        as it was known to have been very common in that Part of the Island, and particularly among the
                                        Negroes of the <placeName rend="italic">Pawpaw</placeName> of <placeName rend="italic">Popo</placeName> Country. Still he was unable to verify his Suspicions, because
                                        the Patients constantly denied their having any Thing to do with Persons of that Order, or
                                        any Knowledge of them. At length <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-arc="negress" a-status="enslaved">a Negress</ecda:anonPers>, who had been ill for some Time, came one
                                        Day and informed him, that feeling it was impossible for her to live much longer, she thought
                                        herself bound in Duty, before she died, to impart a very great Secret, and acquaint him
                                        with the true Cause of her Disorder, in hopes that the Disclosure might prove the Means
                                        of stopping that Mischief which had already swept away a Number of her Fellow-slaves.
                                        She proceeded to say, that <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="female" a-religion="obi">her Step-mother</ecda:anonPers> (a Woman of the <placeName rend="italic">Popo <hi rend="upright">Country</hi></placeName>, above Eighty

                                        who had lately died; and that the old Woman had practised <name rend="italic">Obi</name> for as many Years past
                                        as she could remember.

                                    <p>The other Negroes of the Plantation no sooner heard of this Impeachment, than they ran
                                        in a Body to their Master, and confirmed the Truth of it, adding, that she had carried on
                                        this Business ever since her Arrival from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and was the Terror of the whole Neighbourhood.—
                                        Upon this he repaired directly with Six White Servants to the old Woman's House,
                                        and forcing open the Door, observed the whole inside of the Roof (which was Thatch),
                                        and every Crevice of the Walls, stuck with the Implements of her trade, consisting of Rags,
                                        Feathers, Bones of Cats, and a thousand other Articles. Examining further, a large earthen
                                        Pot or Jar, close covered, was found concealed under the Bed.—It contained a prodigious
                                        quantity of round Balls of Earth or Clay of various Dimensions, large and small, whitened
                                        on the Outside, and variously compounded, some with Hair and Rags or Feathers of all Sorts,
                                        and strongly bound with Twine; others Blended with the upper Section of the Skulls of Cats,
                                        or stuck round with Cats Teeth and Claws, or with Human or Dogs Teeth, and some Glass
                                        Beads of different Colours; there were also a great many Eggshells filled with a viscous or
                                        gummy Substance, the Qualities of which he neglected to examine, and many little Bags
                                        stuffed with a variety of Articles, the Particulars of which cannot at this Distance of Time
                                        be recollected. The House was instantly pulled down, and with the whole of its Contents 
                                        committed to Flames, amidst the general Acclamations of all his other Negroes. In regard
                                        to the old Woman, he declined bringing her to Trial under the Law of the Island, which
                                        would have punished her with Death; but from a Principle of Humanity, delivered her into
                                        the Hands of a Party of <name>Spaniards</name>, who (as she was thought not incapable of doing some
                                        trifling Kind of Work) were very glad to accept and carry her with them to Cuba. From the 
                                        Moment of her Departure, his Negroes seemed all to be animated with new Spirits, and the
                                        Malady spread no farther among them. The Total of his Losses in the course of about Fifteen
                                        Years preceding the Discover, and imputable solely to the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct>, he estimates
                                        at the least, at One Hundred Negroes.

                                        turned about in a very great Fright, and refused to proceed; his Master, surprised at all this,

                                <p><name>Obeah-men</name> are the oldest and most artful Negroes; a Peculairity marks them, and every
                                    Negro pays the greatest Respect to them, they are perfectly well acquainted with medicinal
                                    Herbs, and know the poisonous ones, which they often use. To preposess the Stranger in
                                    favour of their Skill, he is told that they can restore the Dead to Life; for this Purpose he
                                    is shewn a Negro apparently dead, who, by Dint of their Art, soon recovers; this is produced 
                                    by administering the narcotic Juice of Vegetables. On searching one of the <name>Obeah-men's</name>

                                    might be christened, which was done, and the Impression was done away. In consequence 
                                    of the Rebellion of the Negroes in the Year 1760, a Law was enacted that Year to render the

                                    related the Part the <name>Obeah-men</name> had taken, One of whom was capitally convicted and 
                                    sentenced to Death.

                                    they saw him expire. On the other <name>Obeah-men</name>, various Experiments wer made with Exectrical
                                    Machines and Magic Lanthorns, which produced very little Effect; except on one who,
                                    after receiving many severe Shocks, acknowledged his Master's <name>Obeah</name> exceeded his own.

                                    them to explan the Nature of the Evidence, which as been generally required for constituting

                                <p>The Clerks of the Peace in the several Parishes or Precincts of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, whose Duty it is

                                        in the Capacity of Butler or Waiting-man. The Infant which was nursed by One of these
                                        Women happened to die. Her Misbehaviour after this was such as obliged her Master to
                                        turn her out of his House, and she was ordered to work among the Field Negroes, The

                                        Discontent, which were not much regarded; but, in the course of a few Days, the Water of a
                                        Well from whic hthe Family had their daily Supply, was observed to be very much discoloured, 
                                        and intolerably fetid. His Master, imagining these might be the natural Effects of
                                        Stagnation, ordered the Well to be drawn till it was supposed to be nearly drained. But 
                                        notwithstanding this Operation, the Water still continued ill-coloured, nauseous to the Taste,
                                        and offensive to the Smell. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">A Man</ecda:anonPers> was then let down, who brought up a <distinct rend="italic">white Fowl</distinct> in a

                                        On further Examination, a large Quantity of <distinct rend="italic">Indigo Seed</distinct> was fished up from the
                                        Bottom of the Well. These Circumstances occasioned Suspicions of some Mischievous Design.
                                        The Houses of all the Negroes were Searched, and at one of them, inhabited by a

                                        had been recently emptied. This Circumstance brought to mind, that a Phial containing a
                                        Liquid of similar Appearance, had been noticed in the Butler's Pantry, who, upon the first

                                        ought to fall, till the Cook came voluntarily to his Master (apprehensive for his own
                                        Safety, if Poison should be privately thrown into any of his Dishes), and gave positive

                                        Plantation. This Woman fell suddenly into a Decline, without any known Cause, and languishing
                                        for some Time, contracted at length a very morbid Habit of Body. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="doctor">The Doctor who
                                        attended her</ecda:anonPers>, and tried a Variety of Medicens without any good Effect, declared it beyond
                                        his Power to afford her any Reliev, and pronounced her incurable. When her Death was
                                        every Day expected, and after much Importunity to discover the Cause of her Disorder, she 
                                        was prevailed on to confess that her Husband, from a violent Suspicion of her Infidelity to
                                        him, and on her sturdy Denial of the Charge, had obliged her <quote rend="quotes">to take Swear</quote> (as she
                                        called it), by drining a Mixture of <distinct rend="italic">Grave Dirt</distinct> and <distinct rend="italic">water</distinct>, accompanied by the usual
                                        Imprecation (that her Belly might swell and burst, and her Bones rot, if she was guilty). She
                                        concluded with deploring the miserable End to which she had brought herself by denying the 
                                        Fact, for that she really had been false to him. Intelligence of this Confession was given to
                                        her Husband's Master, who sent immediately for him, and representing the Perin in which he
                                        stood under the Law of the Land, which had declared the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct>, with <distinct rend="italic">Grave Dirt</distinct>,
                                        a capital Offence, advised him to go directly to his Wife, and endeavour to cajole her into a
                                        Belief, that it was nothing more than a sly Contrivance of his own to get at the truth: That
                                        the Mixture she had swallowed was not made with <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Dirt</distinct>, but only with a little common
                                        Earth, which he had picked up on the rad, and therefore it was very harmless. The Fellow
                                        (who had owned the Fact to his Master) joyfully took his Advice, and acted his Part so
                                        well , that the poor Woman was completely duped a second Time, and recovering her Spirits,
                                        was soon restored to perfect Health.

                            </p>
                            <p>We observe in Jamaica a great Variety of Soils—The Cane thrives best in deep rich
                                Mould, and on a Clay Bottom, and where Showers are frequent.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the old Estates, which have been under Culture for these 100 Years or upwards,
                                Manure in great Abundance is absolutely Necessary. Those Situations where Canes thrive
                                Best, are in general the very worst for Cotton and Coffee, which will not answer where
                                Rains and Floods are frequent, or the Soil very wet. The far greater Part of the Land at
                                present under Culture for Canes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, is wholly unfit either for Cotton or Coffee. A

                            <p>What Difference is there in the Produce per Acre of different Plantations in the same
                                Year, when not exposed to any extraordinary Accident?
                            </p>
                            <p>In answering this Inquiry, several general Observations must be premised in reference to
                                <placeName rend="italic">Jamaica</placeName>.
                            </p>
                            <p>1st. The Difference of Product so far as depends on unequal Supply of Rains.</p>
                            <p>The Two grand periods of the Year, when the rainy Seasons (or great Rains) are
                                commonly expected, are May and October; and when those Supplies arrive with Regularity (but
                                of late Years the May Season has too frequently failed) the Distribution of Rain, though not
                                equal in all Parts of the Island, is yet universal; but between these Two Periods, a due
                                Frequency of Showers is requisit for each Sugar Estate, in order to sustain Vegetation, and these
                                are very unequally bestowed, depending not only on the Direction in which the Mountains
                                and Hills are ranged, but on the Point from which the Wind may happen to blow; and on
                                the Extent of the Clouds; for it very often happens that an Estate from its particular 
                                Situation, receives Showers for several Days, when the next adjoining Estate, from its
                                Difference in Position in respect to the High-lands, Winds, &amp;c. does not get a Drop.
                            </p>
                            <p>2dly, is to be considered the essential Difference which arises from the difference of Skill and
                                Attention in manuring, planting, weeding, moulding, and the general Operations in
                                this Respect, as well as in the other manufacturing Process, by which the greatest possible
                                Quantity of Sugar is to be extracted.
                            </p>
                            <p>These Considerations being premised, the rest must depend upon the Quality of Soils,
                                which, in Jamaica, are various in each District at large, and almost equally so on the major 
                                Part of the Estates themselves. We believe that the Average Produce, One Year with another,
                                of the whole Island does not amount to much more than Half an Hogshead of Sugar per
                                Acre; particular Spots may yield much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Inquiry perhaps ought, for greater Satisfaction, to be directed to such Gentlemen
                                as are now residing in the Island.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Difference of Produce per Acre on different Plations is very great; much in
                                this Respect depends on the Difference not only of Soil but Mode of Management.

                            <p>By what Causes are Crops on different parts of the same Island partially affected?</p>
                            <p>In Jamaica, by partial Rains, partial Droughts, Floods, and Hurricanes, the Blast and
                                Rats, not to mention the great Disparity occasioned by more or less Skill in Management,
                                or by the healthy or unhealthy state of the Labourers, or their Adequacy or inadequacy in
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                point of Number to the present Crop, because seasonable or unseasonable Weather will
                                increase or diminish the Crop, and the Labour necessary to take it off.
                            </p>
                            <p>It frequently happens, that some Parts of this Island are materially injured by Droughts,
                                strong Winds, and other Causes, while other Parts experience very seasonable Weather.

                            <p>Does the Quantity of labour, which is necessary to require from the Negroes, vary
                                materially in different Parts of the Year, as it does here in Harvest Time, &amp;c. and is there
                                any Period at which the increased Labour produces any particular Effect on the Health of
                                the Negroes?
                            </p>
                            <p>The System of Sugar-making must be considered in its progressive State, as calling for
                                successive operations throughout the Year, as
                                <list>
                                    <item>1st Ploughing.</item>
                                    <item>2d. Holing, manuring, and trenching.</item>
                                    <item>3d. Moulding, weeding, and trashing.</item>
                                    <item>4th. Cutting, grinding, boiling, and curing.</item>
                                    <item>5th. Carting to the Shipping-place.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>Of these several Operations, that of holing and planting is by no means the most laborious;
                                but as it is often unavoidably obliged to be performed in showery Weather, the Negroes, if
                                too much exposed to it, may be liable to obstructed Perspiration and Fevers; but most of the 
                                Planters have moveable Tents or Sheds, which are set up in the Fields, for the Purpose of
                                protecting them from the Effects of heavy Showers.
                            </p>
                            <p>In point of Labour, the Fourth Operation is so far from being oppressive or injurious to
                                the Negroes, that they enjoy better Health in general during the Crop Season (which lasts
                                about Five Months) than at any other Time: This may in Part be ascribed to their free Use
                                of the Cane Liquor (resembling Sweet Wort) and the more settled or drier weather during
                                that Season of the Year.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Work of the Negro Slave in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is far less than that of a Labourer in <placeName>Britain</placeName>;
                                they have in general 15 Hours in 24 to themselves, which is quite sufficient for Sleep, and for
                                cooking and eating their Victuals, to say nothing of Recreations.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Labour of Slaves varies much at different Seasons of the Year: Digging Cane
                                Holes is Considered as the hardest Labour; so long, however as the Slaves continue at that
                                Work, they are regularly served in the Gield with Beverage of Sugar and Water in the
                                Morning, and Rum and Water in the Afternoon. Crop-time (our Harvest) may be deemed
                                hard Labour, as the Work in the Boiling-house is continued Day and Night; but the
                                Slavesdo not so consider it; and indeed, by the free Access they are allowed to the
                                Liquor in the Boiling-house, in the course of its Manufacture into Sugar, the Slaves 
                                universally thrive.

                                employed in Agriculture upon the Sugar Plantations: The Men are averse to labour the
                                Ground even for themselves; and whenever they do it, it is only to supply their immediate
                                Wants: They have all the Vices of Slaves, and no Planter could controul them.

                            <p>We have every Reason to believe it would not: The Nature and Constitution of an <name>European</name>
                                are not so well adapted to retain even Life, much less to support Field Labour, either in the

                            <p>It is not possible for an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Consitution to subsist in this Climate, under the Labour
                                necessary for cultivating a <placeName type="properAdjective">West India</placeName> Plantation.

                            <p>Is the Labour of Cattle, and of what Species and in what Proportion, used in the Cultivation
                                of a <placeName type="properAdjective">West India</placeName> Plantation?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, Oxen in general are used in ploughing, where ploughing is practicable; some
                                (but they are few) make use of Horses for the same Purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>Mules are chiefly used for Carriage on steep Acclivities and bad Roads; in other Places the
                                Carriages are drawn by Oxen.—The Mills are turned by Wind, Water, Mules, Oxen, or
                                Horses.
                            </p>
                            <p>Horned Cattle are used on many Sugar-works, in Ploughing and harrowing the Land;
                                and on all, the Cattle and Mules are used in carrying the Canes to the Mill, Manure to the
                                ground, Copper-wood to the Works, and any other Draught-labour where they can possibly
                                be applied: The Labour of Slaves is, however, absolutely necessary, after the Plough, to 
                                prepare the Land for the Plant.
                            </p>

                            <p>Could the Quantity of Cattle be increased, and could their Labour be substituted for that of
                                Slaves in a greater Extent than it is at present?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> the Quantity of Cattle is daily increasing, and may certainly be increasted
                                very considerably, by continuing to open and settle new Breeding Farms: How far the Assistance
                                of Cattle, in the Cane and other Culture, can be extended beyond what is at present, may
                                depend on a Variety of Circumstances, best learnt, by inquiring on the Spot; for it is 
                                presumed, that there are some thousands of Acres new in Culture, which, from their rocky and 
                                inacessible Nature, cannot be worked by the Plough; and many more thousand Acres yet
                                in the Wilderness, on which, when Cleared, the Plough may probably be usefully employed:
                                Cattle, we believe, are already employed in all the Operations of the <placeName type="properAdjective">Jamaica</placeName> husbandry to
                                which their Assistance is applicable.
                            </p>
                            <p>There is a Sufficiency of Cattle in this Island for Work, and also for the Butcher, and
                                considerbaly more than could be maintained but for the Introduction of Guinea Grass.
                            </p>
                            <p>No Negro-labour is applied, when it is possible to substitute the Labour of Cattle or 
                                Mules.

                                and as the Plough is coming daily into more general Use, the Labour of the Slave is likely to
                                be considerably lightened thereby.

                                without Roads, and underexplored; Error was probably unavoidable, and there is not a
                                Doubt at present, but that their Computation was greatly exaggerated; nor can we say more
                                in favour of subsequent Accounts, than that they are to be considered as mere Opinions of
                                Individuals, unfounded upon geometrical Process; that Island therefore has been lengthened
                                or contracted in its Dimensions, at various Times, by the Caprice of different Authors, as
                                a few out of a great many Examples will shew, viz.

                            <p>In the various Accounts we have of the Dimensions of this Island, there appears a Difference
                                of no less than 40 Miles in Length and 20 in the Breadth; nor have the astronomical
                                Observations, taken at different Periods, been more fortunate in adjusting the Longitude of
                                the Eastern and Western Extremities, for they make a Difference amounting to One Degree in
                                the former and 57 Minutes in the latter.

                                making a variance of 20 Minutes in the Position of that Town; so that until some Principle
                                for accurate Computation can be obtained, no positive Exactness is to be hoped for.

                                Products increased; but as this Question, and the Two succeeding ones, lead into a very
                                minute Investigation and Detail; we are sensible, were we to offer vague Conjecture,
                                instead of substantial Information, it would be very unsatisfactory; and we have only to lament
                                our Want of sufficient Lights to guide us in such multifarious Inquiries, which we think may
                                be made in the Island itself with better Success.

                            <p>The additional Heads of Inquiry, it is presumed, were inteded more immediately to be
                                answered from the Leeward Islands; the Magnitude and Extent of this Island make it difficult
                                to answer them with Accuracy. It is supposed the whole Number of Acres in this Island
                                is about 3,500,000, of which One-fifth may be in Cultivation; and Three-fifths of the
                                Remainder capable of being so.

                            <p>We cannot speak as to the exact Number, but can only say, that the Plough is very commonly,
                                though not universally, in use in Jamaica.—A more precise Answer can only, we
                                think, be obtained by Inquiry among the Planters resident there.

                            <p>The Plough has been used upon a great many Plantations, for the Purpose of preparing the
                                Land; but it is not possible to say on how many, with Precision, as the Use of the Plough
                                has been, and is now, increasing daily, as has been already said in the Answer to the 42d Quære of

                                above mentioned, nearly the same Proportion as in the Year 1768. There are now about

                            <p>Almost every Sugar Plantation in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> (or with very few Exceptions) has Plantains,

                                Intervals between the Rows of young Cane Plants. Those Estates which are situated in Parts of
                                the Island too dry for these Purposed, have usually a Provison Settlement in the adjacent hilly
                                or mountainous Parts, where Showers are more frequent.

                                of the Orads; the comparative Advantages of a Windmill, Watermill, or Cattlemill; the
                                Facility of procuring Wood, or the heavy Charges of importing Coals for Fuel; the Labour
                                required uopon the Estate, the knowing how to direct and apply that Labour to the best Effect,
                                and to preserve the Labourers and their Offspring, and the Cattle, in the fullest Health and Vigour;
                                the Fecundity of the Soil; the Skill of the Planter; in the best-adapted Husbandry; in preparing
                                the raw Material, and in working it up; the Credit and Independence of the Planter, wehreby he is
                                enabled to purchase, with more or less Advantage, the requisite Supplies for the carrying on
                                and Support of his Plantation; the Sagacity and Judgment of the Planter in choosing the
                                most eligible Factor for the Sale of his Produce. Such a Diversity in Talents, Circumstances,
                                and Management of each Estate, make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to answer the
                                first Part of this Question. As to the rest, the Planter who does not reside in the Island,
                                differs from the resident Planter only by having more Deficiency Tax to pay, which is proportioned
                                to the Size of his Family, and a Commission to the Person who has care of the Property
                                during such Absence, both of which operate upon the non-resident Planter as an Absentee
                                Tax.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is apprehended, that upon an Average throughout the Island, the Planter dos no make
                                more than Four per Cent. upon his Capital.

                        <p>The First Part of the Appendix is an Abstract of the <placeName type="properAdjective">Jamaica</placeName> Laws for the Government of
                            the Negro Slaves, beginning with the Act of 1696. The First Column is the Law as it
                            then stood: The Second, Third, and Fourth Columns, are the Alterations that have been made
                            since that Time. I have added at the End of the Act of <date when="1681">1681</date>; but as it does not distinctly appear
                            in that Act, whether the Servants mentioned therein are Negroes, or indented Whies, I have
                            placed it at the End of the Abstract, and have marked it at Bottom with the Letters A and B.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have also added some of the Clauses of the French Code Noir, to save their Lordships
                            Trouble; as by this Means they may immediately compare their Code with our Jamaica Code, and
                            may be acquainted with the Reasoning of the French upon the Necessity of the Employment of
                            Negro Slaves in the Sugar Colonies, which will be found in Page (29), Column 2, of the Abstract
                            of the French Code Noir, at the End of the Appendix.
