                <ab>Your Majesty having been pleased by your Order in Council,
                    bearing date the <date when="1788-02-11">11th of February 1788</date>, to direct that this

                    The <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade, particularly as far as relates to the Practice and
                    Manner of purchasing or obtaining Slaves on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and
                    the Importation and Sale thereof, either in the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Colonies and
                    Settlements, or in the Foreign Colonies and Settlements of <placeName>America</placeName> or
                    <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and also, as far as relates to the Effects and
                    Consequences of this Trade both in <placeName>Africa</placeName> and in the said <rs type="place">Colonies</rs> and
                    Settlements, and to the general Commerce of this Kindgom; and should
                    repot to your Majesty in the Council the Result of their Inquiries, with such
                    Observations as they might have to offer thereupon:
                </ab>
                <ab>The Committee, in obedience to your Majesty's said Order of Reference, 
                    proceeded immediately to investigate the Subject so referred, and
                    examined such Persons as either offered themselves, or such as they
                    thought proper to summon, being in the Judgment of the Committee
                    likely to convey useful Information thereupon; and they applied to the
                    Agents for the several British Islands in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and to your
                    Majesty's Governors and the Councils and Assemblies of the said Islands;
                    and also to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,
                    for Anwers to such Questions as appeared in the Committee to be calculated
                    to produce Information on the several parts of this extensive
                    Subject. The Committee thought proper likewise to apply to your
                    Majesty's Ministers at Foreign Courts for such Information as they might
                    be able to procure concerning the State of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade as carried
                    on by Foreign Countries, and concerning the Manner of transporting
                    Slaves to their respective Colonies, and the Treatment of them there.

                <ab>And the Committee also caused the Books of the late Board of Trade
                    to be searched for all the Information to be found therein respecting
                    this Subject. They also called for, and obtained from the Public 
                    Offices and other Sources, such Accounts as appeared to them to be
                    likely to throw light upon any of the Heads of this Inquiry, and 
                    particularly upon the Extent and Value of this Trade in all its Branches,
                    and the Effects and Consequences of it upon the general Commerce of this
                    Kingdom.
                </ab>
                <ab>And the Committee having been employed for upwards of Twelve
                    Months in collecting Information upon several Points before mentioned,
                    and conceiving it may be your Majesty's Intention to order this Report to
                    be laid as soon as possible before Parliament, have thought it right,
                    without any further Delay, or waiting for any additional Information, to
                    direct that the Information already collected be arranged as nearly as may
