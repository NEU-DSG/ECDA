                <ab>Your Majesty having been pleased by your Order in Council,
                    bearing date the <date when="1788-02-11">11th of February 1788</date>, to direct that this

                    The <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade, particularly as far as relates to the Practice and
                    Manner of purchasing or obtaining Slaves on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and
                    the Importation and Sale thereof, either in the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Colonies and
                    Settlements, or in the Foreign Colonies and Settlements of <placeName>America</placeName> or
                    <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and also, as far as relates to the Effects and
                    Consequences of this Trade both in <placeName>Africa</placeName> and in the said <rs type="place">Colonies</rs> and
                    Settlements, and to the general Commerce of this Kindgom; and should
                    repot to your Majesty in the Council the Result of their Inquiries, with such
                    Observations as they might have to offer thereupon:
                </ab>
                <ab>The Committee, in obedience to your Majesty's said Order of Reference, 
                    proceeded immediately to investigate the Subject so referred, and
                    examined such Persons as either offered themselves, or such as they
                    thought proper to summon, being in the Judgment of the Committee
                    likely to convey useful Information thereupon; and they applied to the
                    Agents for the several British Islands in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and to your
                    Majesty's Governors and the Councils and Assemblies of the said Islands;
                    and also to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,
                    for Anwers to such Questions as appeared in the Committee to be calculated
                    to produce Information on the several parts of this extensive
                    Subject. The Committee thought proper likewise to apply to your
                    Majesty's Ministers at Foreign Courts for such Information as they might
                    be able to procure concerning the State of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade as carried
                    on by Foreign Countries, and concerning the Manner of transporting
                    Slaves to their respective Colonies, and the Treatment of them there.

                <fw type="pageNum">4</fw>
                
                <ab>And the Committee also caused the Books of the late Board of Trade
                    to be searched for all the Information to be found therein respecting
                    this Subject. They also called for, and obtained from the Public 
                    Offices and other Sources, such Accounts as appeared to them to be
                    likely to throw light upon any of the Heads of this Inquiry, and 
                    particularly upon the Extent and Value of this Trade in all its Branches,
                    and the Effects and Consequences of it upon the general Commerce of this
                    Kingdom.
                </ab>
                <ab>And the Committee having been employed for upwards of Twelve
                    Months in collecting Information upon several Points before mentioned,
                    and conceiving it may be your Majesty's Intention to order this Report to
                    be laid as soon as possible before Parliament, have thought it right,
                    without any further Delay, or waiting for any additional Information, to
                    direct that the Information already collected be arranged as nearly as may

                                fixed System of Government; they have a council, consisting of the Alcaide or Governor,
                                the Gerouff or Mayor, the Marabou or Priest, and some of the Elders of the Village, the
                                whole Council being from Seven to Nine in Number; These consult and advise the King,
                                but he is not obliged to follow their Advice, nor does he ever do so, unless it consists with his
                                own Opinion or Interest, or that he apprehends they will have Force sufficient to resist him,
                                which they frequently do.

                            <p>To furnish the Revenues of these Kingdoms, every Village pays a regular Custom to the

                                Merchandize brought from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. When this Custom is paid regularly, the King

                                if not, they are sold for Slaves. The Kings <emph>never</emph> break a Village without some such
                                Pretence; they are understood to be Masters of the Lives of their Subjects; but they use
                                this Power with very great Lenity; only when any of their Subjects are represented by the
                                Alcaide, or Chief of the Village, to be incorrigible, the King makes no Scruple of cutting

                            <p>The People upon the Coast are wholly Mahometans; next to them, internally, there is
                                a Country containing a People called the Sierrieurs, who believe in a Supreme Being, and 
                                testify such Belief by shewing great Marks of Joy and Gratitude on occasion of any Behefits
                                received: they have no Idols, nor any Form of Worship; their principal Tenet is, that
                                they are to be happy in this World, and they endeavour to make themselves so, by every Species
                                of licentious Enjoyment, which they even pursue under Allfiction. The Countries beyond
                                these are chiefly Pagan. The Country of the Sierrieurs is more populous, in proportion to
                                its Extent, than the Mahometan Countries; the Sierrieurs are governed by a Number of
                                independent Chiefs, but they have no Kings. These People are Wanderers, like the Moors,
                                but they wander only within the Limits of their own Country.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Language of these Counties (except the Sierrieurs) is what is called Wolloff; and it 
                                is written in the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> Character.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Black <name>Mahometans</name> upon the Coast are strong and robust, very handsome and
                                remarkably tall; they have woolly Heads, acquiline noses, and thin Lips.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Barras are short and think, with thick Lips, flat Noses, and wooly Heads: They
                                speak the Mundingo Language.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Sierrieurs have Noses quite flat, they think it a Beauty, and press down the Noses of
                                their Children accordingly; they are wooly-headed, strong, short and thinck, and their Faces
                                are tattood; they are fond of War, and are very artful People.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Wolloffs are a sensible, hospitable, and civil People, but jealous and vindictive.</p>
                            <p>The People of Tin are serious in their Disposition, much oppressed by their King, and 
                                naturally jealous and vindictive.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Barbessins and the Barras are an artful People, much accustomed to Chicanery in
                                Trade, and perfidious in their Dealings; they are lively, jealous, and vindictive.
                            </p>
                            <p>The People in general are very indolent; the Men do nothing but smoke, shoot, and fish;
                                the Women do all the Work in the Field, as well as of the House. Every Man is allowed
                                to take as many Wives as he pleases, if he can satisfly the Marabou or Priest that he is
                                able to maintain them. The Wives are in general Slaves to the Husbands, and work very
                                hard.
