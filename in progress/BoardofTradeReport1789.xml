                <ab>Your Majesty having been pleased by your Order in Council,
                    bearing date the <date when="1788-02-11">11th of February 1788</date>, to direct that this

                    The <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade, particularly as far as relates to the Practice and
                    Manner of purchasing or obtaining Slaves on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and
                    the Importation and Sale thereof, either in the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Colonies and
                    Settlements, or in the Foreign Colonies and Settlements of <placeName>America</placeName> or
                    <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and also, as far as relates to the Effects and

                    Settlements, and to the general Commerce of this Kindgom; and should
                    repot to your Majesty in the Council the Result of their Inquiries, with such
                    Observations as they might have to offer thereupon:
                </ab>
                <ab>The Committee, in obedience to your Majesty's said Order of Reference, 
                    proceeded immediately to investigate the Subject so referred, and
                    examined such Persons as either offered themselves, or such as they
                    thought proper to summon, being in the Judgment of the Committee
                    likely to convey useful Information thereupon; and they applied to the
                    Agents for the several British Islands in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and to your
                    Majesty's Governors and the Councils and Assemblies of the said Islands;
                    and also to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,
                    for Anwers to such Questions as appeared in the Committee to be calculated
                    to produce Information on the several parts of this extensive
                    Subject. The Committee thought proper likewise to apply to your
                    Majesty's Ministers at Foreign Courts for such Information as they might
                    be able to procure concerning the State of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade as carried
                    on by Foreign Countries, and concerning the Manner of transporting
                    Slaves to their respective Colonies, and the Treatment of them there.

                <fw type="pageNum">4</fw>
                
                <ab>And the Committee also caused the Books of the late Board of Trade
                    to be searched for all the Information to be found therein respecting
                    this Subject. They also called for, and obtained from the Public 
                    Offices and other Sources, such Accounts as appeared to them to be
                    likely to throw light upon any of the Heads of this Inquiry, and 
                    particularly upon the Extent and Value of this Trade in all its Branches,
                    and the Effects and Consequences of it upon the general Commerce of this
                    Kingdom.
                </ab>
                <ab>And the Committee having been employed for upwards of Twelve
                    Months in collecting Information upon several Points before mentioned,
                    and conceiving it may be your Majesty's Intention to order this Report to
                    be laid as soon as possible before Parliament, have thought it right,
                    without any further Delay, or waiting for any additional Information, to
                    direct that the Information already collected be arranged as nearly as may

                                Monarchies, and are in fact governed more by the Caprice of the Monarch, than by any 
                                fixed System of Government; they have a council, consisting of the Alcaide or Governor,
                                the Gerouff or Mayor, the Marabou or Priest, and some of the Elders of the Village, the
                                whole Council being from Seven to Nine in Number; These consult and advise the King,
                                but he is not obliged to follow their Advice, nor does he ever do so, unless it consists with his
                                own Opinion or Interest, or that he apprehends they will have Force sufficient to resist him,
                                which they frequently do.
                            </p>
                            <p>To furnish the Revenues of these Kingdoms, every Village pays a regular Custom to the
                                King, consisting of Two Parts; the one annual, which is fixed by the King; the other, in
                                proportion to the Trade of the Ships.

                            <p>This Revenue or Custom is paid in Slaves, Powder, Shot, Brandy, Tobacco, and other
                                Merchandize brought from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. When this Custom is paid regularly, the King
                                first gives Notice to pay it, and if not then paid within a certain Time, he comes down with

                                whom he detains for some Time as Pledges: If the Duties are paid, he restores the Prisoners;
                                if not, they are sold for Slaves. The Kings <emph>never</emph> break a Village without some such
                                Pretence; they are understood to be Masters of the Lives of their Subjects; but they use
                                this Power with very great Lenity; only when any of their Subjects are represented by the
                                Alcaide, or Chief of the Village, to be incorrigible, the King makes no Scruple of cutting
                                off their Heads without any Form of Trial.
                            </p>
                            <p>The People upon the Coast are wholly Mahometans; next to them, internally, there is
                                a Country containing a People called the Sierrieurs, who believe in a Supreme Being, and 
                                testify such Belief by shewing great Marks of Joy and Gratitude on occasion of any Behefits
                                received: they have no Idols, nor any Form of Worship; their principal Tenet is, that
                                they are to be happy in this World, and they endeavour to make themselves so, by every Species
                                of licentious Enjoyment, which they even pursue under Allfiction. The Countries beyond
                                these are chiefly Pagan. The Country of the Sierrieurs is more populous, in proportion to
                                its Extent, than the Mahometan Countries; the Sierrieurs are governed by a Number of
                                independent Chiefs, but they have no Kings. These People are Wanderers, like the Moors,
                                but they wander only within the Limits of their own Country.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Language of these Counties (except the Sierrieurs) is what is called Wolloff; and it 
                                is written in the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> Character.

                                remarkably tall; they have woolly Heads, acquiline noses, and thin Lips.

                            <p>The Barras are short and think, with thick Lips, flat Noses, and wooly Heads: They
                                speak the Mundingo Language.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Sierrieurs have Noses quite flat, they think it a Beauty, and press down the Noses of
                                their Children accordingly; they are wooly-headed, strong, short and thinck, and their Faces

                            Voyages to Bonny, Four to Congo and Angola, and the rest to the Windward Coast: Mr. Penny
                            resided in the Isles de Los and the River Kissey on the Windward Coast about Two Years,
                            from 1768 to 1770, as Factor, and quitted the Trade in 1784.

                        <p>In the Parts opposite to the Isles de Los, and the Neighbourhood to the Northward
                            of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, where Mr. Penny has been, the Country is divided into a Number of petty
                            States, ruled by Kings or head Men, whose Districts are very small. The Power of these 
                            Kings or head Men is not absolute and arbitrary; and they generally call a Council consisting of
                            head Men, who are Relations of the Princes, in which all Matters, civil or military, are
                            decided. The religious Institutions of these petty States are principally Pagan; there
                            are some Mahometans, and on the Northern Rivers a few black Christians, made such by 
                            the Portuguese when they were established among them.

                            replied, the Mahometans make a great many by force: There is a large warlike
                            Mahometan Country to the North-east of Sierra Leone, called Fula, whose Inhabitants are
                            descended from Arabs; though of a darker colour, they have Arab Features. The Poers
                            of this Country is employed in making Converts to Mahometanism; they have made a great
                            Progress in converting the People of the Susa Country, which is a Part of the Coast. The
                            Princes on the Rivers Kissey and Malachurry, which are also a Part of this Coast, are Tributaries
                            to the Fula King;  and in thes Two last Countries great Progress has been made in
                            Mahometansim, and is still making. The Black Christians do not attempt to make any
                            Converts; they are an obscure Sort of People, and mix Paganism with the Christian Religion.
                            The King of Sierra Leone sent on of his Sons in 1769 to the Fula Country to learn
                            Mahometanism, and another to Lancaster to learn the Christian Relgion; the latter turned out very
                            profligate. Mr. Penny has seen in that Country several Arabian Teachers come down with
                            Transcripts from the Khoran, to whom they pay great Respect. These Men are sometimes
                            employed in instructing the Youth of the Country in the Arabic Language and in the Mahometan 
                            Religion, and with great Success, and they are in general devout; but notwithstanding
                            their Devotion, the Europeans do not find either their Lives or Properties so safe in the
                            Mahometan Towns as in those where Paganism prevails. The Pagans are humble and submissive;
                            the Mahometans are proud and insolent.

                            believe in a God; and Mr. Mathes concludes, from the Manner of burying their Dead, they
                            have some Notion of a future State, for they bury in the Ground, and hang round the Grave

                        <p>Mr. Norris was employed as Captain of a Vessel in the Slave Trade, in Five Voyages, and is
                            particularly acquainted with the Windward and Gold Coast;—and being asked, what is the
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            Nature of the Government on these Parts of the Coast, replied—There are various Governments
                            in that comprehensive Tract, from the most absolute Monarchy, to others less oppressive to the
                            Subjects: Some are Monarchies, some Republics. He speaks of a Tract of Country extending
                            about 1500 Miles upon the Coast, and upon the Gold Coast 130 Miles inland from Whyday.
                            Mr. Norris is not certain as to the Number of Miles; but the Extend he is able to speak of is,
                            from Sierra Leone River to Benin.

                            Surgeon to a British Slave Ship. The first Voyage was to the Windward or Grain Coast, and
                            Angola: In this Voyage he was taken by a French Man of War. The second Voyage was to
                            the Windward Cost, when he was driven off the Coast by a French Man of War, and went to
                            Angola. The two last Voyages were to Bonny.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government on the Windward Coast is a Sort of Aristocracy.</p>
                        <p>The Gold Coast is divided into small States in general.—Mr. Norris being asked, Whether
                            the People of this country enjoy any Protection from any Civil Rights they have?—Replied—
                            <said>We must distinguish the Countries: In the Fantyn Nation</said> (by which he meant, from Caoe
                            Three Points to Accra), <said>which includes various States, of which the Fantyn is the chief, and
                            whose Manners and Governments are nearly similar, about five Days Journey inland, where 
                            the Europeans have been longest settled, and possess the greates Number of Forts, Civilization
                            has improved beyond any thing he has discovered in any other Country of Africa, and the
                            People have Civil Rights arising from traditionary Laws and Customs; but, even in this
                            Coutnry, much remains to be done towards Civilization. The Bussou and Craba, the confidential
                            Man and favourate Woman, of every Person of Distinction are usually put to Death
                            and interred him.: The imputed Crime of Witchcraft is still believed there, and is
                            punished with Transportation.</said>—By Transportation, Mr. Norris means, selling them to the White
                            Traders, which is represented in this Nation as the greatest Evil that can befal them, in order
                            to deter them from Crimes. The superior State of Civilization in this Country, Mr. Norris
                            imputes to their Intercourse with Europeans; and added—Report says, that formerly a much
                            greater Number were but to Death, and interred with their deceased Lords.
                        </p>
                        <p>Paganism is universal.—By Paganism, Mr. Norris means, the Worship of those Objects which
                            strike the Senses.—At Whyday, a Snake is the principal Object of their Worship; and, besides
                            this, Trees, Caversn, and Amulets round their Necks which are furnished by their Priests.
                            At Cape Coast, the Rocks on which the Fort is built is their Tutelar Deity. A Tyger is the
                            immediate Object of the King of Dahomey's Worship.

                        <p>The States upon the Coast are small, but larger in the interior Country. As to the Religious
                            Institutions, the People worship the Sun, the Sea, Thunder and Lightning, Lakes, &amp;c. The
                            Snake was the peculiar Worship of the ancient People of Whyday, and then this Province was
                            conquered y the King of Dahomey, the Worship of the Snake was continued upon Motives
                            of Policy. Formerly, a Person who killed a Snake was put to Death; but now a Goat is sacrificed
                            as an Atonement.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Devaynes doubts whether a Tyger is the Object of Worship of the King of Dahomey,
                            But says it is an Animal esteemed royal, and it is not to be killed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Respecting the Civil Rights of the People, Mr. Devaynes says—They enjoy Civil Rights
                            and Privileges that are of more ancient Date than our Settlement among them.—He does not
                            believe that the Natives are much improved in their Morals by their Intercourse with the
                            Europeans; on the contrary, he thinks that the worst Blacks are those who have been the most 
                            concerned with the Whites; their Manners and Dress are in some Degree improved thereby.

                            whole Time, except Twenty-eight Months, when he was called home by the Company.

                            Seven Years, had the chief Command of the whole, and resided at Cape Coast Castle.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Miles, being asked, What is in general the Nature of the Government on the Coast of 
                            Africa?—Said—He wished to confine the Information he had to offer entirely to the Gold Coast,
                            which extends from Cape Le Hou to the River Volta, with which Part of the Coast he is best
                            acquainted; not including Whydah, of which he could only speak from Hearsay.
                        </p>
                        <p>On the Gold Coast, he knows but of one despotic Government, which is at Cape Appollonia,
                            the most Western European Settlement: There the King is absolute; the Monarchy is hereditary 
                            in the male Issue of the female Line; the Country is large and Populous. Every other 
                            Part of the Gold Goast is divided into various petty States, governed by very limited
                            Monarchs: tThe Government consists, first, of the King; then of the Elders, who are rarely chosen
                            till they have arrived at the Age of Sixty: Upon the Death of any one of them, the Body of
                            these Elders recommends a Successor to the King, who usually confirms the Choice they have
                            made. The third Estate is composed of Captains of the Troops or Town Soldiers, chosen by
                            the People at large, and removable at their Pleasure. These Countries, so governed, are for the
                            most Part populous.

                            Rocks, and various Idols; to which, on particular Ocassions, they sacrifice Sheep and Goats;
                            and sometimes they make human Sacrifices, of which (though very much discouraged by 
                            Europeans, and therefore practised in secret) Mr. Miles has had ocular Demonstration. They
                            recalled Sophas, whose Persons are on all Occasions sacred.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether the People are a moral People, and appear to have a due Sense of
                            Right and Wrogn?—He replied—In their intercourse and Dealings with each other, they are
                            very exact and strict; they are punished with the Loss of Liberty for the smallest Theft, and
                            all other Crimes; they have a faint Idea of a future State.

                        <p>Jerome Bernard Weuves Esq. resided in Africa Fourteen Years, and always
                            upon the Gold Cast. Mr. Weuves was Governor of Annamaboe from 1778 to 1780. In
                            tthe Month of December 1780, he became Governer of Cape Coast Castle, and continued so
                            till April 1782, returned to Annamaboe in May 1782, and continued there as Governor
                            till his Return to England in January 1784.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Gold Coast is divided into a Number of small Governments, principally consisting of
                            limited Monarchies.
                        </p>
                        <p>The People are all Pagans; they worship the Moon, which is one of their greatest
                            Deities, and Rocks and other Visible Objects. They appear to have a Sense of a supernatural
                            Being, and of a future State, and this they shew by the Sacrifices they make at the Death of
                            their principal People, when they sacrifice some of the Slaves belonging to the deceased, or 
                            others whom they purchase for that Purpose. The Number sacrificed is in Proportion to the
                            Rank of the deceased. Mr. Weuves never saw any of these sacrifices, but has seen the poor 
                            Victims parading about, Two or Three days before they were to be sacrificed, they did not
                            appear to be dejected, but quite the contraryl they were dressed out. It was not customary 
                            for Europeans to go to these Ceremonies, and Mr. Weuves rather thinks the Natives would
                            have made Objections. The Europeans have always endeavoured to prevent this, but the
                            People have a superstitious Idea, that the Manes of the deceased would not be satisfied unless
                            these Sacrifices were made. Mr. Weuves was not near enough to observe whether the Victims
                            appeared to be intoxicated as a Fact, but conceives they had given them Spirits.

                        <p>Archibald Dalzell Esq. went out to Africa as a Surgeon in the Year 1763,
                            and resided Three Years on the Gold Coast, some little part of the Time as Governor,
                            and Four Years as Governor at Whyday, returning to England in the Year 1770; of the 
                            Nature of the Government and Religion on the Gold Coast, he gives the following Account:
                        </p>
                        <p>The Gold Coast is divided into a Number of petty States, governed by Chiefs or Caboceers.
                            They suppose that an ideal Being, called Braffoe, superintends all these States; and this
                            Being they consult by means of their Priests or <distinct>Fetiche Men</distinct>. These Caboceers have each
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            their particular Vassals, but they have not such absolute Power over them as to be able to
                            dispose of them without the Consent of their Fellow Vassals, or the Pynims or Elders of the
                            Town. The Caboceers have no Power over the Lives and Property of their Vassals, except
                            in consequence of Trial, which is before these Pynims or Elders.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Dalzell has not observed that the People on this Coast are more civilized than in
                            other Parts of Africa; they are more hardy and more turbulent.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Religion is Paganism, and the Objects of their Worship are various, but chiefly
                            sensible Objects; it is so unintelligible, that it is extremely difficult to give any Account of it.
                            The Fisherman of Cape Coast Castle worship the Rock on which the Castle stands; and when
                            they cross the River Volta they throw a Bottle of Rum into it to secure them a favourable
                            Passage and safe Return. They have various Superstitions with respect to Food, some 
                            eating one Sort only, and some another.

                        <p>Of the Countries bordering on the Gold Coast, the Kingdom of Dahomey is the largest,
                            governed by the most absolute Tyrant that exists on Earth. Whydah, where the English,
                            French and Portugueze, have Forts, is a Province belonging to the Monarch, having been
                            conquered by his Grandfather about Sixty Years ago. In Dahomey there is not individual
                            Freeman, except the King. The King is absolute Master of the Lives and Properties
                            of his Subjects, and he sports with their Lives in the most wanton and savage
                            Manner. Mr. Norris has seen at the Gates of his Palace Two Piles of Heads, like Shoe in
                            an Arsenal; within the Palace, the Heads of Persons newly put to death are strewed at
                            the Distance of a few yeards in the Passage that leads to the Apartment of the Tyrant, in
                            order to inspire the Person who is to be admitted to an Audience  with Awe and Terror,
                            Mr. Norris does not speak of One particular Tyrant; it is the Custom of the Country on 
                            great Occasions, such as the Recetiopn of Messengers from neighbouring States, or of White
                            Merchants, and in general on Days of Ceremonial; but the great Carnage is once a Year,
                            when the Poll Tax is paid by his Subjects. Mr. Norris cannot exactly say how many are
                            executed in this Manner in the Course of the Year, but speaks within Compass when he
                            reckons them at a Thousand. This is the Custom of the Monarchy, and this Power extends
                            over his whole Dominions. The Kingdom is very populous and runs about 350 Miles
                            inland. The Roof of the Palace is decorated with a prodigious Number of human Heads;
                            and when the King means to make War, it is an Expression in use to say, <distinct rend="italic">The Palace wants <!-- @type here?? -->
                            Thatching</distinct>. The great Men of the Coutnry cut off a few Heads in these Festivals, which is 
                            a Part ontly of the same Ceremonial, and the Victims are taken from those destined for
                            Execution by the King. Parents have no Sort of Property in their Children in the Dahoman
                            Territories; the Children belong  entirely to the King, and are taken by his Order from their
                            Mothers at an early Age, and distributed in Villaged remote from the Place of their Nativity,
                            where there is but little Chance of their being seen, or at least recongized by their Parents
                            afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Motive of this is, that there may be no Family Connections or Combinations, no
                            Associations that might be injurious to the King's unlimited Power.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each Individual is detached and unconnected, and, having no Relatives for whom he
                            is interested, is solicitous only for his own Safety, which he consultes by the most abject 
                            Submission and Obedience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here paternal Affection and filial Love scarcely exist; for Mothers, instead of cherishing,
                            endeavour to suppress those Attachments for their Offspring, which they are certain will be
                            violated as soon as their Children are able to undergo the Fatigue of being removed from
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris added, He should be sorry that Facts so extraodinary should rest on his
                            Assertion only, and referred hiself to William Devaynes Esquire, formerly Governor of
                            the English Fort and Whyday, who had been in this Country likewise.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris being asked, Whether the Persons, executed as before mentioned, are taken
                            without Choice and at Random, and whether they have undergone any Form of Trial?
                            replied, On these Occasions the Slave Holes (by which he means a strong Room in every
                            Slave-merchant's House) are ransacked, and the Sweepings of them, that is the Slaves rejected
                            by the White Men, furnish a Part of these public Executins, whic hconsist besides of
                            Prisoners taken in War, and Delinquents. These Person are carried before a Magistrate and
                            undergo a Sort of Trial. There is no particuplar Time when the Slave Holes are fuller than
                            at others; the Slaves are brought in at different Times and sold as Occastion offers; the
                            Trade is always going on except in War. Being asked, Whether the Inhabitants of Dahomey
                            are taken for these public Executions without having had some Delinquency previously imputed
                            to them? he replied, Those who have not been accused of any Crime are liable to be
                            induced in the public Executions, when Delinquents, or Captives taken in War do not
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            supply a sufficient Number: Notwithstanding this, the People of Dahomey never quit the
                            Country; with an Extraordingary Submission, they revere the Name of their Sovereign, and
                            never mention it in their most private Apartments without kneeling; such is the Force of 
                            Education and Habit. At Abomey, One of the Royal Residences, there are Twenty-five thousand
                            Inhabitants, and at Calmina, the other Royal Residence, about Sixteen Thousand.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether if there were no People of the Description before mentioned, the
                            innocent Inhabitants of Dahomey would be put to death on these Occasions? he replied,
                            There is no Doubt, in such Case they would particularly on the great annual Ceremony,
                            diminish the Number of these Sacrifices. If the King is in want of European Goods,
                            the Number of Executions is smaller; if he is overstocked with Powder, Arms, and European
                            Goods, not wanting Slaves for purchase of them, he puts to Death a greater Number; as
                            it is considered as Part of his Power and Magnificence to make a great Slaughter on this
                            Occasion, and it is celebrated accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris being asked, Whether the Prisoners of War are always made Slaves, or are
                            sometimes put to death? replied, in coonsequence of a Aar that was going on when he was
                            there, 1500 Prisoners were made, many of whom were offered to him. which he declined
                            purchasing, as they appeared unhealty. The King thereupon told him, since that was the 
                            Case, he would put them to death. Mr. Norris advised him against it, and recommended to
                            him to make them Salt Boilers, as they came from the Country that supplied him with Salt, 
                            or to employ them in some other Way; but the King replied, it would be setting a bad 
                            Example, and bringing People into the Coutrny who would hold seditious Language. That
                            his was a peculiar Government, and that these strange People might prejudice his Subjects
                             against it, and infect them with Sentiments incomparable with it. Mr. Norris cannot say what
                             became of these Prisoners; has no Doubt but many sound Purchasers, but imagines the rest
                             were put to death. Mr. Norris believes it to be the general Practice in Dahomey to put the
                             Prisoners of War to death unless they are sold.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Treatment of Strangers, Whites or Blacks, on coming into the Territory
                            of this Prince, Mr. Norris says, the Whites are treated with greater Civility and Attention
                            than in any other Country in Africa. They are provided with Houses and Provisions 
                            on their Journey at the King's Expence, The travelling Arabs, called malayes, are also
                            treated with great Respect; and the Black Messengers from neighbouring States are treated
                            with Attention, and are protected. Being aksed, Whether upon the Arrival of any White
                            Trader in the Captial of the Kindom, these Executins take place, and to what Extent?
                            Mr. Norris said, he never saw less than Six decollated Heads strewed in the Passage leading to
                            the King's apartment when he has been there.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris being asked, Whether he knew any Thing of the Countires bordering on Dahomey,
                            particularly inland? replied, He did, and from Accounts he had heard from Hundreds 
                            of People, the Government of Eyo is the same. He cannot say from his own Knowledge 
                            what becomes of Prisoners and Delinquents in the Eyo Country, but believes they are treated
                            as they are at Dahomey. The Eyo Slave Merchant sells his Slaves to the Slave Dealers
                            of Dahomey. The latter has submitted to pay Tribute to Eyo, and there has not been any
                            War between them for a Period of Thirty or Forty Years past. Mahee, on the other Side of 
                            Dahomey, is a Union of confederate States, and a Species of Republic. It is a Sort of feudal
                            Government; the leading Men have Vassals or Slaves, but they do not treat them in the same 
                            savage Way in which they are treated at Dahomey. The Governors or Leading Men at
                            Mahee sell their Slaves in great Numbers, as well as the Traders of Eyo, to the Dahomey
                            Factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris's Account of the Government, Manners, and Customs, of Dahomey and Whydah
                            having been read to Mr. Devaynes, and the Question put to him, How far that Account
                            agreed with what might have fallen withinhis own Observation? Mr. Devaynes differed with
                            Mr. Norris in Opinion in sme Particulars as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Respecting the Executions, and the making Human Sacrifices on certain Days of Ceremony,
                            Mr. Devaynes in general confirms the Account diven by Mr. Norris, but observes,
                            that the Performance of the Ceremony of Human Sacrifices does not take place on Occasion
                            of the Payment of the Poll Tax (which does not exist), but when the King buries his Father
                            and Mother again (as the Ceremony is called), which is generally about Crhistmas. On this
                            Occasion, about Sixty Men and Women, besides all Kinds of Animals, are put to death, and
                            sent to the deceased, in order that he or she may remain quiet, and not trouble the King; Promise
                            is made by a Cryer, in the Name of the King, that these Sacrifices shall be continued:
                            The Riches of the King are carried, covered, in Procession, in which the King's Women
                            (sometimes to the Amount of Three Thousand) appear: Goods are distributed to the Populace,
                            which are thrown from a high Platform to be scrambled for. Mr. Devaynes attended Ten of
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            these Ceremonies himself. The King lives in his Palace, which stands on a Space of near Three
                            Miles, attended only by Women, some of whom are armed. The King's Great Officers crawl
                            towards him, rubbing their Faces on the Ground, and never rise in his Presence.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to what is stated by Mr. Norris, that these Executions take Place on the Arrival of
                            any White Trader, Mr. Devaynes says, that White People are treated with great Respect; but he
                            is of Opinion, that Mr. Norris must have been at Dahomey at the Time of the Ceremony of 
                            watering the Graves. Mr. Devanes has occasionally, on visiting the King, seen Two or Three
                            Heads lying in the Palace, but does not think the Number of Persons put to Death in his Time
                            was near so many as is mentioned by Mr. Norris. These consisted of Persons sacrificed on Occasion
                            of the Ceremony of watering the Graves of the King's Ancestors; or Prisoners taken in War;
                            or of Delingquents of Note. If a Man happens to fall down on the Space before the King's
                            Palace, which may be about 400 or 500 Yards, they cut his Head off immediately, as they suppose
                            he must have some disloyal Thoughts in his Head to make him fall on level Ground. All
                            Messengers going to and from the King constantly run.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Persons destined for the Executions having undergone any Form of Trial,
                            Mr. Devaynes does not believe that tye do undergo any Sort of Trial, though there may be
                            some sort of Examination. When the Queen's Mother died, he was present when One of the
                            great Officers was taken to be put to Death in order to wait upon her as a Mark of Respect. He
                            does not recollect that any one of the King's great Officers, during the Time he was there, died a
                            natural Death. When the King wishes to get rid of One of them, he says to his Colleagues, what
                            he does not like his Face, or wish to see him again, which is the Expression used, as that of Blood
                            or Death is always avoided in Presence of the King. In consequence of this they take care to put
                            him to Death. There is nothing these People will not do to get into Office, notwithstanding the
                            almost absolute Certainty of Death attending it. They are a happy People, and have greaat
                            Contempt for the Subjects of the neighbouring Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Reason assigned by Mr. Norris, why the Number of Human Sacrifices
                            is sometimes diminished viz. that if the King of Dahomey is overstocked with Powder and other
                            Articles, not wanting Slaves for the Purchase of themn, he puts to Death a greater Number,
                            considering it as Part of his Power and Magnificence; Mr. Devaynes does not think it possible
                            to ascertain the Motives the King may have for putting his Subjects to Death. He believes
                            that when the King wants Eupopean Goods, he sometimes seizes Part of a Village and sells them
                            for Slaves under some frivolous Pretence or other; his Subjects do not however consider this as
                            any great Hardship, as they are all his Slaves and Property,
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to Prisoners of War being always put to Death unless sold for Slaves, Mr. 
                            Devaynes observed that in War the old, the lame, and the wounded are often put to Death
                            on the Spot, to save the Trouble of bringing them away; the young and the healthy, if not
                            immediately sold, are kept for another market, and are sometimes used as House Slaves. The
                            Women Prisoners are never put to Death, but when not sold, are always used as House Slaves.

                        <p>The Nature of the Government at Whydah, which is a Province conquered by the King of
                            Dahomey, and governed by a Viceroy, is despotic in the highest Degree. With respect to any civil
                            Rights enjoyed by the People of this Country, there are certain <distinct rend="italic" type="ethnographic">Customs</distinct> which Mr. Dalzell believes
                            the King of Dahomey would not willingly break through, although he has the Power: He consults 
                            with One or Two of his principal Men, but is in general Master of the Lives and Property of his
                            Subjects. At their Death, their Wives, Property, and all go to the King; but he sometimes
                            restores it to those of the Family whom he finds meritorious.
                        </p>
                        <p>The King, in order to maintain his Authority over his Subjects, at the End of every Year,
                            makes what they call <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>. At this Period the Governors of the respective Provinces of the
                            Kingdom are called to the Capital, and their Conduct examined into: If they have behaved ill
                            they are punished, generally with Death; if well, they are dismissed with Presents. Upon this
                            Occasion the Governors of the Three Forts. viz. French, English, and Portuguese, are invited.
                            Mr. Dalzell attended as Governor of the English Fort in order to pay the King the annual Present
                            of the African Committee, consisting of Silk, Brandy &amp;c. to the Value of about 50L for which
                            he makes a Return of nearly the same Value, which is generally a Slave, and some of the Manufactures
                            of the Country. He is also very liberal to all their Attendants; they are lodged in their
                            Passage to the Capital by the King's Order, and in an House set apart for them at the Capital.
                            During his Stay there, which has sometimes been for three Weeks or upwards, Mr. Dalzell had
                            Opportunities of observing the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>, which he explained as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Every Fourth Day is their Market Day, and may perhaps be called their Sunday, for it is a Day
                            of Rest and Recreation, and of superstitious Ceremony.  On these Days during the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> there is
                            always some Kind of publick Exhibition going on. For instance, One Day is set apart for the
                            killing of Cattle, which Day in general is a Day previous to the Market Day. The Meat, being 
                            in very large Quantity, is dressed by the King's Women, and a large Quantity of the Beer of the 
                            Country is likewise brewed by the same People. This Beer is made of Indian or Guinea Corn.
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            The Meat and Drink is put into clean Baskets, covered with a Cloth, and carried about on the
                            Market Day in Procession by the Women, dressed in their best Cloaths; it is then distributed to
                            the Publick; every one that pleases may come and eat and drink. A large Camp is pitched for
                            the principal Men, who eat a Portion of the above Provision apart from the common People.
                        </p>
                        <p>On another of these Market Days the diversion consists in Singing and Dancing, ant which the
                            Governors of the Forts, the King, and principal People attend. There are professed Singers,
                            whose Songs are extempore, generally in Prase of the King's warlike Exploits; and when he
                            is pleased, he makes the Singers a Present of a Bunch of Cowries; and when very much pleased,
                            as on one Occasion Mr. Dalzell saw him, he made the Performer a Present of a Woman with
                            a Child at her Back.
                        </p>

                        <p>Another of these market Days is allotted to the Distribution of Presents. A large Stage is
                            erected contiguous to the King's House, covered with the Cloths of the Country, and adorned with
                            Flags and Umbrellas. A Fence of Thorns is placed round the Stage at some little Distance to
                            keep of the Rabble. The Stage is laoded with a Profusion of Cowries, Manufactures of the
                            Country, and European Goods. At a certain Time the King appears and orders his different
                            Viceroys, according to their Rank, to chuse a Piece of European Cloth, or the Cloth of the
                            Country, together with a String of large Coral; which done, the King takes a Bunch of Cowries
                            with his own Hands, and throws to the Rabble beyond the Fence. The European Governors,
                            And the other upon the Stage, follow the King's Example, and throw the Whole among the People 
                            who scramble for it, and carry away what they can get; after this, a Man tied, an Alligator
                            tied, a pair of Pigeons also tied, were thrown from the Stage; all of which, as Mr. Dalzell was
                            informed, were put to Death by the People below.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the whole of the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> Mr. Dalzell always found, upon going to the King's House,
                            Heads that appeared to have been fresh cut off; and he has seen, perhaps, about Twenty of those
                            Victims at a Time, previous to their Execution, whom he conceives to have been Men who had
                            been made Prisoners of War or Slaves.—These were tied to Stakes, and exhibited for a Day or
                            more before their execution, which e presumes was done in the Night. He has been desired to
                            go and see it, but never would. He has enquired into the Reason ofthese Executions, and though
                            the People are reserved on this Subject, het he has been told, that they have an Idea of a future
                            of the King in another World; and these Victims are so resigned to their Fate, that Mr. Dalzell
                            himself observed One of them who was tied to the Stake make Efforts to dance at the Sound of
                            the Music; and he cannot say, as far as he observed, that they appeared to be intoxicated. They
                            also sacrifice Horses and Mules on the same Occasion, and probably with the same View.
                        </p>
                        <p>These <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> are repeated once a Year only; and Mr. Dalzell does not know that any but
                            the King performs this Ceremony. He cannot speak as to the Number of People sacrificed on these
                            Occasions, but conceives it to be considerable; he has also seen Numbers of Skulls on the Top of
                            the King's Palace, and also on the Pavement of it. No Subject ventures to approach the King
                            without giving Notice by one of the Eunuchs, of whom there are Ten or Twelve, or by one of 
                            the King's Women, of which there are not so few as Two Thousand. When admitted to his
                            Presence, they approach groveling on their Hands and Knees, and throwing Dust over their Heads,
                            His principal Ministers do the same. When Europeans  or Messengers from the Foreign Countires
                            approach the King, they are allowed to salute him according to the Manner of their respective
                            Countries. Every Stranger carries a Linguist, but that Linguist is obliged to communicate what
                            is said to one of the Ministers who is always present, as it is below the Dignity of the King to
                            take Words from the Mouth of the Linguist. The distinguishing Part of the King's Dress is
                            wearing Sandals. There are Centinels at the outward Doors of the Palace which is a vast Wall of
                            Mud; inclosing a Space as big as St. James's Park; but no Male is allowed to reside within the
                            Walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Religion of the People at Whydah and the general Object of their Worship,
                            Mr. Dalzell observed that in no Part of Africa had be been able to understand the Religion of the
                            Natives. At Whydah they pay a Kind of Veneration to a particular Species of large Snake, which
                            is very gentle. In Dahomey they pay the same Kind of Veneration to Tygers. This Veneration
                            does not prevent People from catching and killing them if they please, but they must not touch
                            the Beard, which is considered a great Offence. They have a great Number of Men they call
                            <distinct type="religious" rend="italic">Fetiche</distinct> Men, or Padres. The Word Fetiche is derived from a Portugueze Word meaning
                            Witchcraft.

                        <p>The Government of Bonny extends only over the Town, and a small District on each Side the
                            River. It is a Monarchy elective and not hereditary. The Election is made out of One of the
                            Families of Royal Blood. It is a limited Monarchy, and no Resolution of consequence is
                            taken, either in civil or military Matters, respecting Peace or War, but by the Advice of a
                            Council composed of the Principal People of the Country, of which Two are Priests. At the
                            Coronation of the King, One of these Priests with other religious Ceremonies, places the Cap,
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            which is a Symbol of Royalty, on his Head. The Priests do not take their own Names, but the
                            Name of the Deity whose Priests they are, and the Natives swear by them. They are not suffered
                            to trade, but ar supported by Government. They live in a separate Twon, which is a Sanctuary
                            and Place of Refuge for Griminals and Debtors. Mr. Penny was at Bonny at the Time of a 
                            contested Election for a King, and after some Contest, the defeated Party took Refuge there from
                            the Resentment of the prevailing one. They hold the Guana, a Species of Lizard, sacred at
                            Bonny. They offer human Sacrifices to the Manes of their King. Mr. Penny was present at a
                            Ceremony of this Sort, where a young Slave was sacrificed with great Pomp, and with other
                            Animals. To give a further Sanction to the Measures taken, there are Twelve old Men, who
                            are appointed by the King and Nobles, and are generally consulted. These are called Parliament
                            Gentlemen. Disputes that arise in Matters of Trade between the Whites and Blacks, are
                            generally referred to these old Men.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Government of the Countries adjoining to Bonny, Mr. Penny can only speak 
                            from Report. No European has ever resided at Bonny on Shore, or been there, except on Ship
                            board for the Purpose of Trade. In the Country on the Sea Coast to the Eastward of Bonny,
                            called Andomey, the Government and Laws are similar to those of Bonny. To the Westard in
                            the Country called Creek, the People are considered as barbarous, and held in Abhorrence by
                            their Neighbours, as they are charged with being Cannibals. Mr. Penny does not know what the
                            Government there is; the interior Part of the Country from whence the Bulk of the Slaves are
                            received, and which is of vast Extent, called Ebo, and another Country bordering on it to the
                            East, called Ebibee, from the concurrent Testimony of the best informed Traders who have been
                            in that Country, are divided into a Number of petty States, governed by despotic Princes independent
                            of each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being aksed, Whether the Subjects of Ebo and Ebibee have any civil Rights? Mr. Penny
                            replied, The Princes are despotic, and have the Command of the Lives and Properties of all
                            their Subjects, excepting only those of their own Family.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Religion of these Countries is idolatrous. In their Houses they have Idols of different
                            Sorts, some represengint Men, and some Animlas. They have no Mahometans amongst them.
                            Mr. Penny conceives that they belive in a future state, and in a good an bad Supreme Deity,
                            with a Number of inverior Deities under them. They place at the End of every Twon a small
                            Quantity of Provision and Water as an Offereing to the bad Deity; and when they commit any
                            bad Action, they impute it to the bad Deity, who they say took Possession of them. This 
                            Account applies principally to the interior Country, but at Bonny, the Religion is nearly similar,
                            except that the Priests have amuch greater Influence there than in the interior Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Penny attributes it to their Intercourse with the Europeans, that the Governments on the
                            Coast appear to be in general more free than in the interior Country; the only Exceptions thereto,
                            are the Countries of Dahomey and Benin, which extend to the Sea Coast. He has observed, that
                            in the monarchical Governments, where there is a stronger Government to protect them, the Lives
                            and the Properties of Strangers are more secure than in the Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government of New Calabar is nearly similar to that of Bonny, except that the King is
                            a mere Pageant. The Power chiefly resides in the principal Traders, who govern very much in
                            the King's Name. There is a Man there called <distinct rend="italic">Anachree</distinct>, who has more Influence and Wealth
                            than all the rest of the Community, though he himself is a purchased Slave brought from the
                            Braspan Coutnry; he has offered the Price of a hundred Slaves for his Freedom, but, according
                            to the Laws of the Country he cannot obtain it, though his Master, who is an obscure, and a poor
                            Individual, would gladly let him have it. It is contrary to a fundamental Law of the Country that
                            a purchased Slave should become free, and the Priests, who are Interpreters and Guardians of the
                            Laws are afraid, if it should be permitted in the Case of this Man, of establishing a dangerous
                            Precedent. It is a small Country and they are apprehensive that the purchased Slaves, if emancipated, 
                            should make themsleves Masters of it. Notwithstanding the great Influence and Wealth
                            of this Man, his Power is, in many Instances, restrained by his Condition of Slavery.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Countries bordering on the Interior of New Calabar, are the same that border upon Bonny.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the religious Institutions at New Calabar, Mr. Penny cannot give any Account.
                            He does not know any Thing of Old Calabar.

                            they began to trade for Slaves, and completed their Cargo. In the second Voyage wend and slaved
