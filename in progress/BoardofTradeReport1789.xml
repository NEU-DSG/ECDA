        <!-- a note for the next encoder:
        
        I have mostly been encoding name-like things for this round of proofing (name, persName, placeName), as well as anonymous persons.
        I have encoded *some* commodities/flora/fauna, but largely left those unencoded.
        I have not filled in any refs for persName.
        
        I completed Part I, up through the section on "produce" (see running heads)
        Part II is not encoded.
        Part III is encoded through the end of the "Jamaica" section
        
        Note that in the Jamaica Appendix, where the text goes into columns, I only encoded the left-most column. I made a note about that
        section at the top, so I hope the logic of it makes sense.
        
        Some of the years of dates I left blank (if they weren't explicitly stated), but I'm pretty sure most of them are either 1788 or 1789.
        
        In regards to anonymous persons, this text has a lot of border cases for a-status. Especially w/ regards to enslaved/free. People are
        being enslaved and being freed throughout, so I don't know how we should mark this.

                <p>The Committee, in obedience to your Majesty's said Order of Reference, <!-- title?? -->
                    proceeded immediately to investigate the Subject so referred, and
                    examined such Persons as either offered themselves, or such as they
                    thought proper to summon, being in the Judgment of the Committee
                    likely to convey useful Information thereupon; and they applied to the
                    Agents for the several <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Islands in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; and to your
                    Majesty's Governors and the Councils and Assemblies of the said Islands;

                    for Answers to such Questions as appeared in the Committee to be calculated
                    to produce Information on the several parts of this extensive
                    Subject. The Committee thought proper likewise to apply to your
                    Majesty's Ministers at Foreign Courts for such Information as they might
                    be able to procure concerning the State of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade as carried
                    on by Foreign Countries, and concerning the Manner of transporting
                    Slaves to their respective Colonies, and the Treatment of them there.

                    to be searched for all the Information to be found therein respecting
                    this Subject. They also called for, and obtained from the Public 
                    Offices and other Sources, such Accounts as appeared to them to be
                    likely to throw light upon any of the Heads of this Inquiry, and 
                    particularly upon the Extent and Value of this Trade in all its Branches,

                                the Gerouff or Mayor, the Marabou or Priest, and some of the Elders of the Village, the
                                whole Council being from Seven to Nine in Number; These consult and advise the King,
                                but he is not obliged to follow their Advice, nor does he ever do so, unless it consists with his
                                own Opinion or Interest, or that he apprehends they will have Force sufficient to resist him,
                                which they frequently do.

                            <p>To furnish the Revenues of these Kingdoms, every Village pays a regular Custom to the
                                King, consisting of Two Parts; the one annual, which is fixed by the King; the other, in
                                proportion to the Trade of the Ships.
                            </p>
                            <p>This Revenue or Custom is paid in Slaves, <ecda:commodity>Powder</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Shot</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>, and other
                                Merchandize brought from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. When this Custom is paid regularly, the King
                                first gives Notice to pay it, and if not then paid within a certain Time, he comes down with

                                whom he detains for some Time as Pledges: If the Duties are paid, he restores the Prisoners;
                                if not, they are sold for Slaves. The Kings <emph>never</emph> break a Village without some such
                                Pretence; they are understood to be Masters of the Lives of their Subjects; but they use
                                this Power with very great Lenity; only when any of their Subjects are represented by the
                                Alcaide, or Chief of the Village, to be incorrigible, the King makes no Scruple of cutting
                                off their Heads without any Form of Trial.

                            <p>The People upon the Coast are wholly <name>Mahometans</name>; next to them, internally, there is
                                a Country containing a People called the <name>Sierrieurs</name>, who believe in a Supreme Being, and 
                                testify such Belief by shewing great Marks of Joy and Gratitude on occasion of any Benefits
                                received: they have no Idols, nor any Form of Worship; their principal Tenet is, that
                                they are to be happy in this World, and they endeavour to make themselves so, by every Species
                                of licentious Enjoyment, which they even pursue under Affliction. The Countries beyond
                                these are chiefly <name>Pagan</name>. The Country of the <name>Sierrieurs</name> is more populous, in proportion to
                                its Extent, than the Mahometan Countries; the Sierrieurs are governed by a Number of
                                independent Chiefs, but they have no Kings. These People are Wanderers, like the <name>Moors</name>,
                                but they wander only within the Limits of their own Country.

                                are tattood; they are fond of War, and are very artful People.

                            <p>The <name>Barbessins</name> and the <name>Barras</name> are an artful People, much accustomed to Chicanery in
                                Trade, and perfidious in their Dealings; they are lively, jealous, and vindictive.
                            </p>
                            <p>The People in general are very indolent; the Men do nothing but smoke, shoot, and fish;
                                the Women do all the Work in the Field, as well as of the House. Every Man is allowed
                                to take as many Wives as he pleases, if he can satisfy the Marabou or Priest that he is
                                able to maintain them. The Wives are in general Slaves to the Husbands, and work very
                                hard.

                        <p>The Sentence was pronounced by the King, with the Advice of the head Men; and the
                            Punishment was, sometimes to be sold as Slaves, sometimes to get a Slave in their room.
                            The Crimes for which these People were in general accused and tried, were Adultery the

                            of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, where <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has been, the Country is divided into a Number of petty
                            States, ruled by Kings or head Men, whose Districts are very small. The Power of these 
                            Kings or head Men is not absolute and arbitrary; and they generally call a Council consisting of
                            head Men, who are Relations of the Princes, in which all Matters, civil or military, are
                            decided. The religious Institutions of these petty States are principally <name>Pagan</name>; there
                            are some <name>Mahometans</name>, and on the Northern Rivers a few black <name>Christians</name>, made such by 
                            the <name>Portuguese</name> when they were established among them.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, Whether the Black <name>Christians</name>, or the <name>Mahometans</name>, make any Converts?
                            replied, the <name>Mahometans</name> make a great many by force: There is a large warlike
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Country to the North-east of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, called <placeName>Fula</placeName>, whose Inhabitants are
                            descended from <name>Arabs</name>; though of a darker colour, they have <rs type="properAdjective">Arab</rs> Features. The Poers
                            of this Country is employed in making Converts to <name>Mahometanism</name>; they have made a great
                            Progress in converting the People of the <placeName>Susa Country</placeName>, which is a Part of the Coast. The
                            Princes on the <placeName>Rivers Kissey</placeName> and <placeName>Malachurry</placeName>, which are also a Part of this Coast, are Tributaries
                            to the Fula King;  and in these Two last Countries great Progress has been made in
                            <name>Mahometanism</name>, and is still making. The Black <name>Christians</name> do not attempt to make any
                            Converts; they are an obscure Sort of People, and mix <name>Paganism</name> with the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Religion.
                            The <persName>King of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName></persName> sent on of his <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-religion="mohametan">Sons</ecda:persGroup> in <date when="1769">1769</date> to the <placeName>Fula Country</placeName> to learn

                            profligate. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has seen in that Country several <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> Teachers come down with
                            Transcripts from the <rs type="title">Khoran</rs>, to whom they pay great Respect. These Men are sometimes
                            employed in instructing the Youth of the Country in the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> Language and in the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> 
                            Religion, and with great Success, and they are in general devout; but notwithstanding
                            their Devotion, the <name>Europeans</name> do not find either their Lives or Properties so safe in the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Towns as in those where <name>Paganism</name> prevails. The <name>Pagans</name> are humble and submissive;
                            the <name>Mahometans</name> are proud and insolent.

                            People have Civil Rights arising from traditionary Laws and Customs; but, even in this
                            Country, much remains to be done towards Civilization. The Bussou and Craba, the confidential
                            Man and favourite Woman, of every Person of Distinction are usually put to Death
                            and interred him.: The imputed Crime of Witchcraft is still believed there, and is
                            punished with Transportation.</said>—By Transportation, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> means, selling them to the White
                            Traders, which is represented in this Nation as the greatest Evil that can befal them, in order
                            to deter them from Crimes. The superior State of Civilization in this Country, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>
                            imputes to their Intercourse with <name>Europeans</name>; and added—Report says, that formerly a much
                            greater Number were but to Death, and interred with their deceased Lords.

                        <p><name>Paganism</name> is universal.—By <name>Paganism</name>, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> means, the Worship of those Objects which
                            strike the Senses.—At <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, a Snake is the principal Object of their Worship; and, besides
                            this, Trees, Caverns, and Amulets round their Necks which are furnished by their Priests.
                            At <placeName>Cape Coast</placeName>, the Rocks on which the Fort is built is their Tutelar Deity. A Tyger is the
                            immediate Object of the <persName>King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>'s</persName> Worship.

                            Snake was the peculiar Worship of the ancient People of <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, and then this Province was

                            of Policy. Formerly, a Person who killed a Snake was put to Death; but now a Goat is sacrificed
                            as an Atonement.

                            concerned with the Whites; their Manners and Dress are in some Degree improved thereby.

                            the most Western <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Settlement: There the King is absolute; the Monarchy is hereditary 
                            in the male Issue of the female Line; the Country is large and Populous. Every other 
                            Part of the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is divided into various petty States, governed by very limited
                            Monarchs: The Government consists, first, of the King; then of the Elders, who are rarely chosen
                            till they have arrived at the Age of Sixty: Upon the Death of any one of them, the Body of
                            these Elders recommends a Successor to the King, who usually confirms the Choice they have
                            made. The third Estate is composed of Captains of the Troops or Town Soldiers, chosen by
                            the People at large, and removable at their Pleasure. These Countries, so governed, are for the
                            most Part populous.

                        <p>The Inhabitants are <name>Pagans</name>, and have different material Objects of Worship, such as Rivers,
                            Rocks, and various Idols; to which, on particular Occasions, they sacrifice Sheep and Goats;
                            and sometimes they make human Sacrifices, of which (though very much discouraged by 
                            <name>Europeans</name>, and therefore practised in secret) <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> has had ocular Demonstration. They
                            recalled Sophas, whose Persons are on all Occasions sacred.

                            very exact and strict; they are punished with the Loss of Liberty for the smallest Theft, and
                            all other Crimes; they have a faint Idea of a future State.

                            the Month of <date when="1780-12">December 1780</date>, he became Governor of <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName>, and continued so

                        <p>The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is divided into a Number of small Governments, principally consisting of
                            limited Monarchies.

                        <p>The People are all <name>Pagans</name>; they worship the Moon, which is one of their greatest
                            Deities, and Rocks and other Visible Objects. They appear to have a Sense of a supernatural
                            Being, and of a future State, and this they shew by the Sacrifices they make at the Death of
                            their principal People, when they sacrifice some of the Slaves belonging to the deceased, or 
                            others whom they purchase for that Purpose. The Number sacrificed is in Proportion to the
                            Rank of the deceased. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> never saw any of these sacrifices, but has seen the poor 
                            Victims parading about, Two or Three days before they were to be sacrificed, they did not
                            appear to be dejected, but quite the contrary they were dressed out. It was not customary 
                            for <name>Europeans</name> to go to these Ceremonies, and <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> rather thinks the Natives would
                            have made Objections. The <name>Europeans</name> have always endeavoured to prevent this, but the
                            People have a superstitious Idea, that the Manes of the deceased would not be satisfied unless
                            these Sacrifices were made. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> was not near enough to observe whether the Victims
                            appeared to be intoxicated as a Fact, but conceives they had given them Spirits.

                            Merchants, and in general on Days of Ceremonial; but the great Carnage is once a Year,
                            when the Poll Tax is paid by his Subjects. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot exactly say how many are
                            executed in this Manner in the Course of the Year, but speaks within Compass when he
                            reckons them at a Thousand. This is the Custom of the Monarchy, and this Power extends
                            over his whole Dominions. The Kingdom is very populous and runs about 350 Miles
                            inland. The Roof of the Palace is decorated with a prodigious Number of human Heads;
                            and when the King means to make War, it is an Expression in use to say, <distinct rend="italic">The Palace wants <!-- @type here?? -->
                            Thatching</distinct>. The great Men of the Country cut off a few Heads in these Festivals, which is 
                            a Part only of the same Ceremonial, and the Victims are taken from those destined for
                            Execution by the King. Parents have no Sort of Property in their Children in the <rs type="properAdjective">Dahoman</rs>
                            Territories; the Children belong entirely to the King, and are taken by his Order from their
                            Mothers at an early Age, and distributed in Villages remote from the Place of their Nativity,
                            where there is but little Chance of their being seen, or at least recognized by their Parents
                            afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Motive of this is, that there may be no Family Connections or Combinations, no
                            Associations that might be injurious to the King's unlimited Power.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each Individual is detached and unconnected, and, having no Relatives for whom he
                            is interested, is solicitous only for his own Safety, which he consults by the most abject 
                            Submission and Obedience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here paternal Affection and filial Love scarcely exist; for Mothers, instead of cherishing,
                            endeavour to suppress those Attachments for their Offspring, which they are certain will be
                            violated as soon as their Children are able to undergo the Fatigue of being removed from
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> added, He should be sorry that Facts so extraordinary should rest on his
                            Assertion only, and referred himself to <persName>William Devaynes</persName> Esquire, formerly Governor of
                            the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Fort and <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, who had been in this Country likewise.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether the Persons, executed as before mentioned, are taken
                            without Choice and at Random, and whether they have undergone any Form of Trial?
                            replied, On these Occasions the Slave Holes (by which he means a strong Room in every
                            Slave-merchant's House) are ransacked, and the Sweepings of them, that is the Slaves rejected
                            by the White Men, furnish a Part of these public Executions, which consist besides of
                            Prisoners taken in War, and Delinquents. These Person are carried before a Magistrate and
                            undergo a Sort of Trial. There is no particular Time when the Slave Holes are fuller than
                            at others; the Slaves are brought in at different Times and sold as Occasion offers; the
                            Trade is always going on except in War. Being asked, Whether the Inhabitants of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>
                            are taken for these public Executions without having had some Delinquency previously imputed
                            to them? he replied, Those who have not been accused of any Crime are liable to be
                            induced in the public Executions, when Delinquents, or Captives taken in War do not
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            supply a sufficient Number: Notwithstanding this, the People of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> never quit the
                            Country; with an Extraordinary Submission, they revere the Name of their Sovereign, and
                            never mention it in their most private Apartments without kneeling; such is the Force of 
                            Education and Habit. At <placeName>Abomey</placeName>, One of the Royal Residences, there are Twenty-five thousand
                            Inhabitants, and at <placeName>Calmina</placeName>, the other Royal Residence, about Sixteen Thousand.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether if there were no People of the Description before mentioned, the
                            innocent Inhabitants of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> would be put to death on these Occasions? he replied,
                            There is no Doubt, in such Case they would particularly on the great annual Ceremony,
                            diminish the Number of these Sacrifices. If the King is in want of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Goods,
                            the Number of Executions is smaller; if he is overstocked with Powder, Arms, and <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Goods, not wanting Slaves for purchase of them, he puts to Death a greater Number; as
                            it is considered as Part of his Power and Magnificence to make a great Slaughter on this
                            Occasion, and it is celebrated accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether the Prisoners of War are always made Slaves, or are
                            sometimes put to death? replied, in consequence of a War that was going on when he was
                            there, 1500 Prisoners were made, many of whom were offered to him. which he declined
                            purchasing, as they appeared unhealthy. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="king" a-gender="male">King</ecda:anonPers> thereupon told him, since that was the 
                            Case, he would put them to death. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> advised him against it, and recommended to
                            him to make them Salt Boilers, as they came from the Country that supplied him with Salt, 
                            or to employ them in some other Way; but the King replied, it would be setting a bad 
                            Example, and bringing People into the Country who would hold seditious Language. That
                            his was a peculiar Government, and that these strange People might prejudice his Subjects
                            against it, and infect them with Sentiments incomparable with it. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot say what
                            became of these Prisoners; has no Doubt but many sound Purchasers, but imagines the rest
                            were put to death. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> believes it to be the general Practice in <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> to put the
                            Prisoners of War to death unless they are sold.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Treatment of Strangers, Whites or Blacks, on coming into the Territory
                            of this Prince, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> says, the Whites are treated with greater Civility and Attention
                            than in any other Country in <placeName>Africa</placeName>. They are provided with Houses and Provisions 
                            on their Journey at the King's Expence, The travelling Arabs, called malayes, are also
                            treated with great Respect; and the Black Messengers from neighbouring States are treated
                            with Attention, and are protected. Being asked, Whether upon the Arrival of any White
                            Trader in the Capital of the Kingdom, these Executions take place, and to what Extent?
                            <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> said, he never saw less than Six decollated Heads strewed in the Passage leading to
                            the King's apartment when he has been there.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether he knew any Thing of the Countries bordering on <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>,
                            particularly inland? replied, He did, and from Accounts he had heard from Hundreds 
                            of People, the Government of <placeName>Eyo</placeName> is the same. He cannot say from his own Knowledge 
                            what becomes of Prisoners and Delinquents in the <placeName>Eyo Country</placeName>, but believes they are treated
                            as they are at <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>. The <placeName>Eyo</placeName> Slave Merchant sells his Slaves to the Slave Dealers
                            of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>. The latter has submitted to pay Tribute to Eyo, and there has not been any
                            War between them for a Period of Thirty or Forty Years past. Mahee, on the other Side of 
                            <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>, is a Union of confederate States, and a Species of Republic. It is a Sort of feudal
                            Government; the leading Men have Vassals or Slaves, but they do not treat them in the same 
                            savage Way in which they are treated at <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>. The Governors or Leading Men at
                            Mahee sell their Slaves in great Numbers, as well as the Traders of <placeName>Eyo</placeName>, to the <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>
                            Factors.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris's</persName> Account of the Government, Manners, and Customs, of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> and <placeName>Whydah</placeName>
                            having been read to <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName>, and the Question put to him, How far that Account
                            agreed with what might have fallen within his own Observation? <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> differed with
                            <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> in Opinion in same Particulars as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Respecting the Executions, and the making Human Sacrifices on certain Days of Ceremony,
                            <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> in general confirms the Account given by <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>, but observes,
                            that the Performance of the Ceremony of Human Sacrifices does not take place on Occasion
                            of the Payment of the Poll Tax (which does not exist), but when the King buries his Father
                            and Mother again (as the Ceremony is called), which is generally about Christmas. On this
                            Occasion, about Sixty Men and Women, besides all Kinds of Animals, are put to death, and
                            sent to the deceased, in order that he or she may remain quiet, and not trouble the King; Promise
                            is made by a Cryer, in the Name of the King, that these Sacrifices shall be continued:
                            The Riches of the King are carried, covered, in Procession, in which the King's Women
                            (sometimes to the Amount of Three Thousand) appear: Goods are distributed to the Populace,
                            which are thrown from a high Platform to be scrambled for. <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> attended Ten of
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            these Ceremonies himself. The King lives in his Palace, which stands on a Space of near Three
                            Miles, attended only by Women, some of whom are armed. The King's Great Officers crawl
                            towards him, rubbing their Faces on the Ground, and never rise in his Presence.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to what is stated by <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>, that these Executions take Place on the Arrival of
                            any White Trader, <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> says, that White People are treated with great Respect; but he
                            is of Opinion, that <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> must have been at <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> at the Time of the Ceremony of 
                            watering the Graves. <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> has occasionally, on visiting the King, seen Two or Three
                            Heads lying in the Palace, but does not think the Number of Persons put to Death in his Time
                            was near so many as is mentioned by <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>. These consisted of Persons sacrificed on Occasion
                            of the Ceremony of watering the Graves of the King's Ancestors; or Prisoners taken in War;
                            or of Delinquents of Note. If a Man happens to fall down on the Space before the King's
                            Palace, which may be about 400 or 500 Yards, they cut his Head off immediately, as they suppose
                            he must have some disloyal Thoughts in his Head to make him fall on level Ground. All
                            Messengers going to and from the King constantly run.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Persons destined for the Executions having undergone any Form of Trial,
                            <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> does not believe that they do undergo any Sort of Trial, though there may be
                            some sort of Examination. When the Queen's Mother died, he was present when One of the
                            great Officers was taken to be put to Death in order to wait upon her as a Mark of Respect. He
                            does not recollect that any one of the King's great Officers, during the Time he was there, died a
                            natural Death. When the King wishes to get rid of One of them, he says to his Colleagues, what
                            he does not like his Face, or wish to see him again, which is the Expression used, as that of Blood
                            or Death is always avoided in Presence of the King. In consequence of this they take care to put
                            him to Death. There is nothing these People will not do to get into Office, notwithstanding the
                            almost absolute Certainty of Death attending it. They are a happy People, and have great
                            Contempt for the Subjects of the neighbouring Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Reason assigned by <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>, why the Number of Human Sacrifices
                            is sometimes diminished viz. that if the King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> is overstocked with Powder and other
                            Articles, not wanting Slaves for the Purchase of them, he puts to Death a greater Number,
                            considering it as Part of his Power and Magnificence; <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> does not think it possible
                            to ascertain the Motives the King may have for putting his Subjects to Death. He believes
                            that when the King wants <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Goods, he sometimes seizes Part of a Village and sells them
                            for Slaves under some frivolous Pretence or other; his Subjects do not however consider this as
                            any great Hardship, as they are all his Slaves and Property,
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to Prisoners of War being always put to Death unless sold for Slaves, <persName>Mr. 
                            Devaynes</persName> observed that in War the old, the lame, and the wounded are often put to Death
                            on the Spot, to save the Trouble of bringing them away; the young and the healthy, if not
                            immediately sold, are kept for another market, and are sometimes used as House Slaves. The
                            Women Prisoners are never put to Death, but when not sold, are always used as House Slaves.

                            the King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> would not willingly break through, although he has the Power: He consults 
                            with One or Two of his principal Men, but is in general Master of the Lives and Property of his
                            Subjects. At their Death, their Wives, Property, and all go to the King; but he sometimes
                            restores it to those of the Family whom he finds meritorious.
                        </p>
                        <p>The King, in order to maintain his Authority over his Subjects, at the End of every Year,
                            makes what they call <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>. At this Period the Governors of the respective Provinces of the
                            Kingdom are called to the Capital, and their Conduct examined into: If they have behaved ill
                            they are punished, generally with Death; if well, they are dismissed with Presents. Upon this
                            Occasion the Governors of the Three Forts. viz. <name>French</name>, <name>English</name>, and <name>Portuguese</name>, are invited.
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> attended as Governor of the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Fort in order to pay the King the annual Present
                            of the <orgName>African Committee</orgName>, consisting of <ecda:commodity>Silk</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity> &amp;c. to the Value of about 50L for which
                            he makes a Return of nearly the same Value, which is generally a Slave, and some of the Manufactures
                            of the Country. He is also very liberal to all their Attendants; they are lodged in their
                            Passage to the Capital by the King's Order, and in an House set apart for them at the Capital.
                            During his Stay there, which has sometimes been for three Weeks or upwards, <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> had
                            Opportunities of observing the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>, which he explained as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Every Fourth Day is their Market Day, and may perhaps be called their Sunday, for it is a Day
                            of Rest and Recreation, and of superstitious Ceremony.  On these Days during the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> there is
                            always some Kind of publick Exhibition going on. For instance, One Day is set apart for the
                            killing of Cattle, which Day in general is a Day previous to the Market Day. The <ecda:food>Meat</ecda:food>, being 
                            in very large Quantity, is dressed by the King's Women, and a large Quantity of the <ecda:food>Beer</ecda:food> of the 
                            Country is likewise brewed by the same People. This <ecda:food>Beer</ecda:food> is made of <ecda:flora><rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> or Guinea Corn</ecda:flora>.
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            The Meat and Drink is put into clean Baskets, covered with a Cloth, and carried about on the
                            Market Day in Procession by the Women, dressed in their best Cloaths; it is then distributed to
                            the Publick; every one that pleases may come and eat and drink. A large Camp is pitched for
                            the principal Men, who eat a Portion of the above Provision apart from the common People.
                        </p>
                        <p>On another of these Market Days the diversion consists in Singing and Dancing, ant which the
                            Governors of the Forts, the King, and principal People attend. There are professed Singers,
                            whose Songs are extempore, generally in Praise of the King's warlike Exploits; and when he
                            is pleased, he makes the Singers a Present of a Bunch of Cowries; and when very much pleased,
                            as on one Occasion <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> saw him, he made the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="performer">Performer</ecda:anonPers> a Present of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Woman</ecda:anonPers> with
                            a <ecda:anonPers>Child</ecda:anonPers> at her Back.

                        <p>Another of these market Days is allotted to the Distribution of Presents. A large Stage is  <!-- not sure if I should make the person at the end of this ¶ an anonPers? -->
                            erected contiguous to the King's House, covered with the Cloths of the Country, and adorned with
                            Flags and Umbrellas. A Fence of Thorns is placed round the Stage at some little Distance to
                            keep of the Rabble. The Stage is loaded with a Profusion of Cowries, Manufactures of the
                            Country, and <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Goods. At a certain Time the King appears and orders his different
                            Viceroys, according to their Rank, to chuse a Piece of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Cloth, or the Cloth of the
                            Country, together with a String of large Coral; which done, the King takes a Bunch of Cowries
                            with his own Hands, and throws to the Rabble beyond the Fence. The <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Governors,
                            And the other upon the Stage, follow the King's Example, and throw the Whole among the People 
                            who scramble for it, and carry away what they can get; after this, a Man tied, an <ecda:fauna>Alligator</ecda:fauna>
                            tied, a pair of <ecda:fauna>Pigeons</ecda:fauna> also tied, were thrown from the Stage; all of which, as <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> was
                            informed, were put to Death by the People below.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the whole of the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> always found, upon going to the King's House,
                            Heads that appeared to have been fresh cut off; and he has seen, perhaps, about Twenty of those
                            Victims at a Time, previous to their Execution, whom he conceives to have been Men who had
                            been made Prisoners of War or Slaves.—These were tied to Stakes, and exhibited for a Day or
                            more before their execution, which he presumes was done in the Night. He has been desired to
                            go and see it, but never would. He has enquired into the Reason of these Executions, and though
                            the People are reserved on this Subject, yet he has been told, that they have an Idea of a future
                            of the King in another World; and these Victims are so resigned to their Fate, that <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName>
                            himself observed One of them who was tied to the Stake make Efforts to dance at the Sound of
                            the Music; and he cannot say, as far as he observed, that they appeared to be intoxicated. They
                            also sacrifice <ecda:fauna>Horses</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>Mules</ecda:fauna> on the same Occasion, and probably with the same View.
                        </p>
                        <p>These <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> are repeated once a Year only; and <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> does not know that any but
                            the King performs this Ceremony. He cannot speak as to the Number of People sacrificed on these
                            Occasions, but conceives it to be considerable; he has also seen Numbers of Skulls on the Top of
                            the King's Palace, and also on the Pavement of it. No Subject ventures to approach the King
                            without giving Notice by one of the Eunuchs, of whom there are Ten or Twelve, or by one of 
                            the King's Women, of which there are not so few as Two Thousand. When admitted to his
                            Presence, they approach groveling on their Hands and Knees, and throwing Dust over their Heads,
                            His principal Ministers do the same. When <name>Europeans</name>  or Messengers from the Foreign Countries
                            approach the King, they are allowed to salute him according to the Manner of their respective
                            Countries. Every Stranger carries a Linguist, but that Linguist is obliged to communicate what
                            is said to one of the Ministers who is always present, as it is below the Dignity of the King to
                            take Words from the Mouth of the Linguist. The distinguishing Part of the King's Dress is
                            wearing Sandals. There are Centinels at the outward Doors of the Palace which is a vast Wall of
                            Mud; inclosing a Space as big as <placeName>St. James's Park</placeName>; but no Male is allowed to reside within the
                            Walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Religion of the People at <placeName>Whydah</placeName> and the general Object of their Worship,
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> observed that in no Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> had be been able to understand the Religion of the
                            Natives. At <placeName>Whydah</placeName> they pay a Kind of Veneration to a particular Species of large Snake, which
                            is very gentle. In <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> they pay the same Kind of Veneration to Tygers. This Veneration
                            does not prevent People from catching and killing them if they please, but they must not touch
                            the Beard, which is considered a great Offence. They have a great Number of Men they call
                            <distinct type="religious" rend="italic">Fetiche</distinct> Men, or Padres. The Word Fetiche is derived from a <rs type="properAdjective">Portugueze</rs> Word meaning
                            Witchcraft.

                        <p>The Government of <placeName>Bonny</placeName> extends only over the Town, and a small District on each Side the
                            River. It is a Monarchy elective and not hereditary. The Election is made out of One of the
                            Families of Royal Blood. It is a limited Monarchy, and no Resolution of consequence is
                            taken, either in civil or military Matters, respecting Peace or War, but by the Advice of a
                            Council composed of the Principal People of the Country, of which Two are Priests. At the
                            Coronation of the King, One of these Priests with other religious Ceremonies, places the Cap,
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            which is a Symbol of Royalty, on his Head. The Priests do not take their own Names, but the
                            Name of the Deity whose Priests they are, and the Natives swear by them. They are not suffered
                            to trade, but are supported by Government. They live in a separate Town, which is a Sanctuary
                            and Place of Refuge for Criminals and Debtors. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> was at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> at the Time of a 
                            contested Election for a King, and after some Contest, the defeated Party took Refuge there from
                            the Resentment of the prevailing one. They hold the <ecda:fauna>Guana</ecda:fauna>, a Species of Lizard, sacred at
                            <placeName>Bonny</placeName>. They offer human Sacrifices to the Manes of their King. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> was present at a
                            Ceremony of this Sort, where <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved">a young Slave</ecda:anonPers> was sacrificed with great Pomp, and with other
                            Animals. To give a further Sanction to the Measures taken, there are Twelve old Men, who
                            are appointed by the King and Nobles, and are generally consulted. These are called <orgName>Parliament
                            Gentlemen</orgName>. Disputes that arise in Matters of Trade between the Whites and Blacks, are
                            generally referred to these old Men.

                        <p>With respect to the Government of the Countries adjoining to <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> can only speak 
                            from Report. No <name>European</name> has ever resided at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> on Shore, or been there, except on Ship
                            board for the Purpose of Trade. In the Country on the Sea Coast to the Eastward of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>,
                            called <placeName>Andomey</placeName>, the Government and Laws are similar to those of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>. To the Westward in
                            the Country called <placeName>Creek</placeName>, the People are considered as barbarous, and held in Abhorrence by
                            their Neighbours, as they are charged with being Cannibals. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not know what the
                            Government there is; the interior Part of the Country from whence the Bulk of the Slaves are
                            received, and which is of vast Extent, called <placeName>Ebo</placeName>, and another Country bordering on it to the
                            East, called <placeName>Ebibee</placeName>, from the concurrent Testimony of the best informed Traders who have been
                            in that Country, are divided into a Number of petty States, governed by despotic Princes independent
                            of each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether the Subjects of Ebo and Ebibee have any civil Rights? Mr. Penny
                            replied, The Princes are despotic, and have the Command of the Lives and Properties of all
                            their Subjects, excepting only those of their own Family.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Religion of these Countries is idolatrous. In their Houses they have Idols of different
                            Sorts, some representing Men, and some Animals. They have no <name>Mahometans</name> amongst them.
                            <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> conceives that they believe in a future state, and in a good an bad Supreme Deity,
                            with a Number of inferior Deities under them. They place at the End of every Town a small
                            Quantity of Provision and Water as an Offering to the bad Deity; and when they commit any
                            bad Action, they impute it to the bad Deity, who they say took Possession of them. This 
                            Account applies principally to the interior Country, but at <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, the Religion is nearly similar,
                            except that the Priests have a much greater Influence there than in the interior Country.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> attributes it to their Intercourse with the <name>Europeans</name>, that the Governments on the
                            Coast appear to be in general more free than in the interior Country; the only Exceptions thereto,
                            are the Countries of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> and <placeName>Benin</placeName>, which extend to the Sea Coast. He has observed, that
                            in the monarchical Governments, where there is a stronger Government to protect them, the Lives
                            and the Properties of Strangers are more secure than in the Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government of <placeName>New Calabar</placeName> is nearly similar to that of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, except that the King is
                            a mere Pageant. The Power chiefly resides in the principal Traders, who govern very much in
                            the King's Name. There is <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a Man</ecda:anonPers> there called <distinct rend="italic">Anachree</distinct>, who has more Influence and Wealth
                            than all the rest of the Community, though he himself is a purchased Slave brought from the
                            <placeName>Braspan Country</placeName>; he has offered the Price of a hundred Slaves for his Freedom, but, according
                            to the Laws of the Country he cannot obtain it, though <ecda:anonPers>his Master</ecda:anonPers>, who is an obscure, and a poor
                            Individual, would gladly let him have it. It is contrary to a fundamental Law of the Country that
                            a purchased Slave should become free, and the Priests, who are Interpreters and Guardians of the
                            Laws are afraid, if it should be permitted in the Case of this Man, of establishing a dangerous
                            Precedent. It is a small Country and they are apprehensive that the purchased Slaves, if emancipated, 
                            should make themselves Masters of it. Notwithstanding the great Influence and Wealth
                            of this Man, his Power is, in many Instances, restrained by his Condition of Slavery.

                        <p>Of the Government of this Country, <persName>Captain Hall</persName> gives the following Account.</p>
                        <p>The Business of the Town at the <placeName>River Del Rey</placeName> appeared to be managed by the old Men.
                            They had a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King</ecda:anonPers>, who was absolute, but he always availed himself of the Advice of these <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="council">old
                            Men</ecda:persGroup>, who were his Council.
                        </p>
                        <p>At <placeName>Calabar</placeName> they had Three Kings, one of which had the Civil Government, the other was at the
                            Head of the Religion, and the third at the Head of the Law. Private Disputes were settled by
                            the Head of the Law. Matters of Greater Consequence were settled by the Three Kings with the
                            Elders of the Country. They have no written Law.
                        </p>
                        <p>They have no Money in this Country; Copper Rods about Fifteen Inches long are substituted
                            for Money. They have no Taxes, and no Army. They never were in actual War while he was
                            there, but he saw them making Preparation for War, either to resist Encroachments, or against
                            their Rivals in Trade, which consists of Slaves and a little <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>. He does not believe any Wars
                            are entered into upon the Sea Coast for the Purpose of making Slaves. In the Year <date when="1768">1768</date>, there
                            was a very violent War, and the Slaves made in it were all either sold or massacred, and none remained in
                            the Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Cause of this violent War was this: There was a New Town on the River Calabar, settled
                            from the Old Town. This Town became considerable, and grew to be a Rival in Trade to the
                            Old Town. In the Year <date when="1786">1786</date>, there were Seven Ships which lay at the Point which separated the
                            Two Towns. The Two of these belonged to <placeName>London</placeName>, and the other Five to <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. Trade
                            was very slack, and hardly any Slaves were to be purchased, from the Jealousy that subsisted between
                            the Two Towns, which made it unsafe for Parties to go into the Country. The Captains
                            of the <placeName type="properAdjective">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName type="properAdjective">Bristol</placeName> Ships agreed to invite on board their Ships the People of both Towns,
                            in order to bring about a Reconciliation; at the same Time they entered into an Agreement with
                            the People of the New Town to cut off all the Old Town People the Day they met on board. So
                            perfectly satisfied were the Old Town People of the Sincerity of the Captains of the Ships to bring
                            about a Reconciliation, that the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King of the Old Town</ecda:anonPers> gave his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Daughter</ecda:anonPers> to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Wife</ecda:anonPers> to the principal
                            Trader of the New Town. The next Morning at Eight o'Clock, one of the Ships fired a Gun
                            as a Signal to the others, when the Crews on board the other Ships made an Attempt to secure
                            all the Old Town People; those who resisted were put to Death by the Captains and Seamen of
                            the Ships.—Immediately after the Firing commenced, the New Town Canoes, which were lying
                            in Ambush behind the Point, came forward, and took up those who had jumped overboard, belonging
                            to the Old Town. After this the New Town People went along-side the different Ships,
                            Four of Which delivered up the Prisoners they had made to the New Town Canoes. The principal
                            Men of Old Town were put to Death in the Canoes by the New Town People; the lower
                            Class Prisoners were sold to the Ships as Slaves. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="captain">One Captain</ecda:anonPers>, who had secured <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">Two of the
                            King's Brothers</ecda:persGroup>, refused to deliver them up, till his Ship was supplied with Slaves; and when his
                            Ship was supplied, which was very soon, from the Number of Prisoners taken, he told the principal
                            Man of New Town that he would not deliver them up, but would carry them off the Coast, 
                            which he did.

                            up, and put on board-Ship to be sent back to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Jones</persName>, an <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Merchant
                            in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, who had Ships trading to <placeName>Old Calabar</placeName>, got them taken out of the Ship by a 
                            Habeas Corpus, and they were returned in one of the Ships to <placeName>Old Calabar</placeName>, after an Absence of
                            Five or Six Years, while <persName>Captain Hall</persName> was there. The <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King of Old Town</ecda:anonPers> was fortunate enough
                            to make his Escape by killing <ecda:persGroup>Two of the Ship's Crew</ecda:persGroup>, who first endeavoured to seize him. He
                            then got into a little Canoe, called a One Man Canoe; One of the Ships fired a Gun at the Canoe
                            and broke it in two; he then swam on Shore, and got into the Wood opposite the Ship. He
                            was about three Miles off, where he was attended by the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="surgeon">Surgeon of the London Ships</ecda:anonPers>. This was
                            the Commencement of the War, which lasted three or four Years.

                        <p>The Account given by the <ecda:anonPers a-status="freed" a-gender="male">King's Brothers</ecda:anonPers> of their Treatment in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, was, that they
                            had not been treated well there; but were well used in <placeName>America</placeName>.

                        <p>The Government of the Country from <placeName>Congo</placeName> to <placeName>Angola</placeName> is limited Monarchy. In the Kingdoms
                            of <placeName>Loango</placeName>, <placeName>Melimba</placeName>, and <placeName>Cabenda</placeName>, which are on the Coast, the Inheritance goes in the female
                            Line; that is, the Sons of the Daughters only succeed. A Princess in this Country is invested
                            with a great Power, and may marry whom she pleases. In this she is not influenced by Affection
                            but selects some Freeman who is become rich by his Talents and Industry in Trade, and who is
                            enabled better to administer to her Extravagance, and the more effectually to support her
                            Dignity. She does not even consult this Person until her Messengers announce to him the Princess's
                            Resolution of the Honour she intents of making him her Husband, which is generally received
                            with Reluctance, and sometimes with Horror; for he must for ever quit his Home, his Wives,
                            and Children. The only Consolation he has is, that he becomes a Prince; and to distinguish such
                            Person from a Prince born, he is denominated a Catched Prince; a Guard is appointed him, partly
                            as an Appendage to his new Dignity, and partly as a Watch over his Actions; such Guard
                            being the Creatures of his Wife the Princess, should he be so imprudent as to have any
                            Commerce with his former Wives, or any other Women, Death would be the immediate Consequence,
                            while the Princess is left at large without Controul, and often carries on her Amours without any
                            Regard to Decency; nor dare her Husband complain.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Manner in which these Monarchies are limited is as follows:</p>
                        <p>There is a Council of Princes of the Blood Royal, whom the King is bound to consult on all
                            Occasions, and there are Two great Officers of State who are principally concerned in the 
                            Government of the Country. The one having the Direction of the interior Country, and the other Prince
                            that of the Sea Coast and Trade; the former is called the King's Mongoba, and the other Prince
                            Mambooka. There is another Officer called the Mamfooka, who is the Governor at the Place
                            where the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Factories are established, but who is subject to the Controul of the Prince
                            Mambooka beforementioned. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> speaks from his own Knowledge with respect to the Laws of his
                            Country, is not permitted to see the Sea, nor to wear any Manufactures of any Country but his
                            own, nor to have any Thing to do with Trade; but through the Mongoba he receives certain
                            Customs upon the Trade of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>From <placeName>Cape Lopez</placeName> to <placeName>Angola</placeName> the Extent is about 140 Leagues. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> cannot positively
                            say what is the Extent of the Three Kingdoms before mentioned, <emph>inland</emph>, but believes it may be
                            from 200 to 300 miles. He cannot say any Thing positively with respect to the Nature of the
                            Government in any of the interior Countries bordering on the said Three Kingdoms, but understands
                            that they are divided into Petty States, governed by Princes, with the Nature of whose Authority
                            he is not much acquainted.

                        <p ana="#religion">With respect to the religious Institutions of these Kingdoms, the People believe in a good and
                            bad Deity: They have some few Images, but he never understood they worshipped them; he rather
                            believes they are considered as Charms or Amulets. They bury their Princes with great Pomp and
                            Lamentation, consuming a great Variety of their Effects, and the Trinkets of the deceased, but
                            they have not any human Sacrifices; the lower Orders of the People follow this Example as far as 
                            their Circumstances permit. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has never observed them to pray, and the Reason they

                            <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> can say nothing; but at <placeName>Senegal</placeName> he has known them made Slaves for the 
                            Commission of Crimes. The Crimes they are charged with are Theft and Adultery (very
                            commonly), but principally Witchcraft. They are tried for these Crimes before the King, or the <!-- does witchcraft count as Obeah? -->

                        <p><persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> being asked whether he did not apprehend that Crimes were imputed for the Purpose of 
                            making Slaves? said, No; and added, that as far as he had been acquainted with <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
                            he does not know of any Country where consisted with the Laws of the Country) Justice is more
                            fairly administered; it is administered always in the Presence of the Seniors of the District, and
                            with their Approbation and Consent. In the Countries wherewith <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> has been particularly
                            acquainted, he never heard of the Kings or the great men breaking up Villages for the Purpose of 
                            making Slaves. He has heard, that when the Payment of the Revenue has been refused,
                            and in Cases of Rebellion, or any Kind of Resistance against the King, he has attacked those
                            Villages and seized the Inhabitants, some of whom have been made Slaves, but they are always
                            allowed to redeem themselves.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> has known some Prisoners of War made Slaves, but not very often; he never
                            heard of any who had been kidnapped by the Black Traders; he has not only resided at <placeName>Senegal</placeName>, 
                            but has been at <placeName>Gambia</placeName>, and in the <placeName>Bite of Benin</placeName>, and never know any Country where 
                            <emph>Kidnapping</emph> was practised, or where the Constitution of the Country would admit of it; it is
                            impossible they should do it without being detected, and they would be punished very severely
                            in consequence: <seg ana="#punishment">The Punishment in such Cases would never be less than Two Slaves for any
                            single Slave of the basest Quality, and for others, in Proportion to their Quality, as far as Ten
                            or a Dozen.</seg> <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> believes, that the principal Source of Slavery is Crimes; and when he
                            considers the Extent of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and how populous in all Parts where he has been, he is not
                            surprized that this Source should furnish the great Number of Slaves which it does: The Wars, in
                            those Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName> where he has been, are not destructive Wars, and do not therefore much
                            diminish the Numbers of People. <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> never heard that Wars were made for the
                            Purpose of procuring Slaves, nor does he believe that such a War is practicable; for if a Prince
                            was to make War on such a Motive, he would draw all the neighbouring States upon himself.
                            The Wars in <placeName>Africa</placeName> spring from the same Causes as those in <placeName>Europe</placeName>; and as their Governments
                            are very weak, there are also internal Wars between the Chiefs or great men of the respective
                            Kingdoms.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most of the Slaves exported from <placeName>Senegal</placeName> are brought from the interior country; they are
                            bought of the Black Traders, who are either Natives of the Two Kingdoms of <placeName>Walo</placeName>, and <placeName>Cayor</placeName> or
                            <placeName>Demel</placeName>, or of the interior Country, who bring them down from thence to different Parts of the
                            River. The <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> trade in small Vessels to <placeName>Fort St. Joseph</placeName>, which is near 360 Leagues up the
                            River, and go sometimes as far as the first Cataract, which is about 20 Leagues further, where 
                            they purchase Slaves, who are supposed to be brought from Places 200 or 300 Leagues higher
                            up the Country.

                        <p>The <placeName>River Senegal</placeName> is supposed to take its Rise from the western Declivity of the Mountains of
                            <placeName>Gowvina</placeName>, which rise in the Desert, and run North and South. The <placeName>River Niger</placeName> takes its Rise
                            from the Eastern Declivity of those Mountains, and discharges itself into a large Lake, the Name
                            of which <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> does not recollect: The <name>Africans</name> navigate both these Reviers, and in such
                            Places where there are Cataracts carry their Goods upon Asses. The Slaves which are brought
                            down to <placeName>Gambia</placeName>, as well as <placeName>Senegal</placeName>, are collected in the Countries bordering on the above Rivers.
                            <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> has heard from the Black Traders, that there are White Inhabitants upon the Borders
                            of the Lake before mentioned, who have a Fort mounted with Guns upon the Lake; and has
                            been told, from People who have seen them, that they dress in the Stile of <name>Barbary Moors</name>, and
                            wear Turbans, but do not speak <name>Arabick</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> being asked, if he knew at what age Slaves are purchased? replied, They are
                            seldom purchased under the Age of Fourteen; as the lowest Size required for the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName> is
                            Four Feet. They are purchased from Fourteen Years of Age to Thirty-five in general, but
                            sometimes even so old as Fifty. The Question being asked, if they are made Slaves so young as
                            Fourteen for Crimes? he replied, For one Species of Crimes is very often, namely, Witchcraft;
                            because the <seg ana="#punishment">Punishment for the Crime of Witchcraft involves in it the whole Family</seg>. In <placeName>Senegal</placeName>
                            and <placeName>Gambia</placeName> there are very few Slaves bought at so early an Age as Fourteen; they are generally
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            grown People. The Profit arising from the Slaves sold for Crimes goes in general to the Person
                            injured.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Number of Slaves exported from <placeName>Senegal</placeName> is but small, about 1400 or 1500 annually. <persName>Mr.
                            Barnes</persName> cannot tell what becomes of those Slaves condemned to be sold for Crimes, who are not
                            purchased by the <name>Europeans</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Barnes</persName> being asked, whether our Traders obtained at present Slaves from <placeName>Port Anderic</placeName>?
                            replied, No; they trade for nothing there but Gum Senega. Being asked, if any Trade is carried
                            on in <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Manufactures up the <placeName>River Senegal</placeName> and down the <placeName>Niger</placeName>, or in <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Produce
                            up the <placeName>Niger</placeName> and down the <placeName>Senegal</placeName>? said, There is no commercial Communication between
                            the Two Rivers; the Slaves who are brought from the interior Country, are brought over the
                            Mountains, or through the Passes of them. It is understood that these interior Countries have a
                            great deal of <emph>commercial Communication</emph> both with <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and the States of <placeName>Barbary</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Barnes</persName>
                            speaks to his own Knowledge of a very great Communication between the Banks of the <placeName>River
                            Senegal</placeName> and the Kingdom of <placeName>Morocco</placeName>. The King of <placeName>Morocco</placeName> claims a Sovereignty over this
                            Country as far as the <placeName>River Senegal</placeName>, and levies a Tribute upon the different Tribes of <name>Moors</name>
                            inhabiting the same. There is likewise a very great Communication between <placeName>Morocco</placeName> and the
                            Inhabitants of the <placeName>River Senegal</placeName>, who sell great Numbers of Slaves, which are carried into the
                            Kingdom of <placeName>Morocco</placeName>. A like Communication is carried on, by means of Caravans, with the 
                            more inland Counties in the same Parallel of Latitude, from <placeName>Tunis</placeName> and <placeName>Tripoly</placeName>; and still farther 
                            to the Eastward, through <placeName>Nubia</placeName>, with the Upper <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. the Commodities furnished to
                            the Negroes of these Countries consist chiefly in <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Arms</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Ammunition</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Horses</ecda:commodity>, some
                            of the <ecda:commodity>Cloths of <placeName>Barbary</placeName></ecda:commodity>, and the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>; and the Returns are made, for the greatest Part,
                            in <rs type="properAdjective">Negro</rs> Slaves, and some little Gold.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Charles Wadstrom</persName>, a Native of <placeName>Sweden</placeName>, has been from <placeName>Senegal</placeName> almost to <placeName>Gambia</placeName>.
                            He went from <placeName>France</placeName> in the Month of <date when="1787-07">July 1787</date>, arrived upon the Coast about the <date when="1787-08-31">last
                            Day of August</date>, and remained there till the <date when="1788-01">Middle or End of January</date>. He went out with <ecda:persGroup>Two
                            of his Countrymen</ecda:persGroup>, with the Intention of penetrating into the interior Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and to
                            proceed to the <placeName>Red Sea</placeName>; but they were prevented by the Wars between the Negroes and the
                            <name>Moors</name>, and also between the Negroes and the <name>French</name> settled at <placeName>Senegal</placeName>; the latter arose on
                            Account of exclusive Privileges granted to the <orgName>Senegal Company</orgName>. The Gum Trade was always
                            carried on by an exclusive Company, but the <name>French</name> have now extended the exclusive Privilege to 
                            every sort of Trade carried on at the <placeName>River Senegal</placeName>, which has given great Offence to all the 
                            Inhabitants of that Country.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> was much on Shore, and has been told by the Black and the Mulatto Inhabitants
                            upon the Coast, as well as by the travelling Blacks and Mulattoes, of many of the
                            Slaves exported from that Country, are Prisoners made in War; that these Wars are frequently
                            excited by the <name>Mundingos</name>, a People who live in the interior Part of the Country, and are for
                            the most Part <name>Mahometans</name>. That the <name>Mundingos</name> buy the Slaves and bring them to certain
                            Places, where they are met by the Traders, who bring them down to the Coast. Being asked if
                            he has ever conversed with any of the <name>Mundingos</name>? he said, No; They never came to <placeName>Goree</placeName> or
                            <placeName>Senegal</placeName>; but he has been told they sometimes come to <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> and <placeName>Gambia</placeName>. <persName>Mr.
                            Wadstrom</persName> being asked, whether he knew of any other Means by which Slaves were made? replied,
                            When there is no War, and they cannot therefore obtain Slaves that Way, the King of the Country,
                            who is absolute, seizes upon his own People and exchanges them for <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Merchandize.
                            There are however some Families in the Country who are not liable to be seized upon and made
                            Slaves and sold. the Princes of the Country, of whom there are a great Number, are the
                            Persons who sell the Slaves, and who chiefly carry on this Trade. It is necessary always to apply
                            to them upon arriving on the Coast, and all the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Merchandize is sold through their
                            Means. They are also principally concerned in the bringing down the Slaves who come from
                            the interior Country; and whatever other Merchants there may be, they are in fact Dependants
                            of these Princes.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> excepts from this Description the Subjects of some of the Countries, particularly
                            of the Kingdom of <placeName>Demel</placeName>, who carry on a Trade in Slaves themselves, frequently seizing the
                            Blacks who are Subjects of other Kingdoms, and are travelling through the Country, or who
                            live on the Frontiers of the neighbouring States, and sending them away immediately on board
                            such Ships as lie at hand; but this may be considered as a Sort of contraband Trade, and is
                            against the Laws of the Country. The greatest Number of the Slaves sold in the Time of Peace
                            are Children and Women, these being more easily seized on, as not being able to defend
                            themselves. There are some Slaves sold in consequence of their Crimes, but <persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> is
                            sure these make the smallest Part. 
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> being asked, What was the Number of Slaves which, to his Knowledge, were
                            sold in those Part of the Coast during the Time he was there, and the Proportion of Men, Women,
                            and Children? said, he could not speak with Certainty, without Recourse to his Papers; but to
                            take the Number rather below than above, he estimated them at from 600 to 700. That more than
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            half of this Number were Women and Children, and of them the greater Part Children, and some
                            of them very young. Of these 600 or 700, the greater Number whilst he was there were Natives
                            of the Coast, for at that Time there were no considerable Wars in the interior Country. The
                            Trade in Slaves upon the Coast he speaks of, is carried on by the French only.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> being asked, Whether there were not Traders who go into the interior Country
                            for the purpose of buying Slaves, independent of any Wars existing there? said, that when he
                            was on the Coast, it was not the Season when the Slaves are brought down from the interior Country;
                            during the Harvest Time of the Country it generally at Peace; when the Harvest is over they 
                            frequently make War upon each other. Being asked, Whether of the Numbers he had seen, who
                            were made Slaves, they in general expressed any Concern at the Loss of their Liberty? He said,
                            There were some who did not, but the greater Number do, particularly the Women; it could not
                            be expected that the Children should.

                                <p><persName>Captain Wignie</persName>, a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Captain, from <placeName>Rochelle</placeName>, who arrived here a few Days ago from
                                    <placeName>Albreda</placeName>, a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Factory in the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>, where he had spent some Months in trading
                                    for Slaves, communicated to me a melancholy Circumstance that happened during his Stay there.
                                    He informed me that Three English Vessels had lately cut off at the Mouth of that River by
                                    the Natives along the Shore.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Reason of such a dreadful Catastrophe was this: it is usual when a Vessel is slaved, and
                                    ready to sail, for Free Negroes to come on board to be treated with Punch and other Things, and
                                    to take their Leave. This was the Case on Board one of the Vessels alluded to, when a favourable
                                    Wind suddenly springing up, the Captain sailed away with those who had come on board in this Manner.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Wind however suddenly changing again, he was driven back to the same Part of the 
                                    Coast from whence he had taken them. The Natives on the Shore, being apprized of his
                                    Return, seized the Vessel, and not only his, but (as <persName>Captain Wignie</persName> was informed) Two
                                    others of the same Nation. Only a few out of all their Crews were fortunate to escape, and
                                    these took Refuge at the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Factory at <placeName>Albreda</placeName>, where <persName>Captain Wignie's</persName> Vessel lay. Whether
                                    the Captains were all of them killed or not, <persName>Captain Wignie</persName> does not immediately recollect.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Captain Wignie</persName> assured me also, that the taking away of Free Negroes frequently happens,
                                    particularly among the <name>English</name> and <name>Dutch</name>. Captain Le Loup also gave me the same Sort of 
                                    Information upon the Coast.

                            Years ago, and from thence made a Journey into the interior Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. From that
                            part of the Coast no Export Trade in Slaves is carried on; but the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> Colonists settled in
                            Farms in the interior Part of the Country, to the Distance of 900 Miles, frequently seize on the
                            Hottentot Inhabitants, and force them to Work for them. A Vessel is sent generally every Three
                            Years to purchase Slaves for the Use of this Colony, from <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>; they do not chuse to send
                            to <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>, as it is so near, being afraid they would escape and get back. <placeName>Cape Town</placeName> is

                            and <placeName>Sumatra</placeName>; the laborious Work at <placeName>Cape Town</placeName> is entirely done by Slaves; he does not

                        <p><persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> has lately been at <placeName>Senegal</placeName>, <placeName>Goree</placeName>, and <placeName>Shual</placeName>. He sailed from <placeName>France</placeName> in the
                            <date when="1787-07">Month of July 1787</date>, arrived on the Coast about the end of August, and remained there till the
                            Middle or End of January. The Object of his Voyage was partly Health and partly Curiosity,
                            particularly with a View to Natural History; his Design was to penetrate into the interior Parts of
                            <placeName>Africa</placeName>, but met with so many Obstacles, that he was obliged to give up that Part of his Project.
                            Being asked in what manner the Slaves exported from this part of the Coast are procured, and
                            how they are made Slaves? <persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> gave the following Account:
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Kings of the Country want Slaves for the Purchase of Goods, they send their Horsemen
                            in the Night to the Villages to make as many Slaves as they can. In the Neighbourhood of
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            <placeName>Goree</placeName>, he saw one of these Expeditions. The <persName>King of <placeName>Barbessin</placeName></persName> came to him in the Night to tell
                            him that he was going to send out a Party to make Slaves, as he wanted <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity> to encourage his
                            Officers. In the Course of the Conversation, the King became so intoxicated with <ecda:commodity>Madeira</ecda:commodity> by
                            <persName>Dr. Spaarman's</persName> Bed Side, that he was carried away speechless. <persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> saw the Party set
                            out, and saw them return with some Slaves they had made. They conceal Part of those they make
                            on these Occasions, in order to enhance their Price.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Way of making Slaves is by Wars, which are frequently entered into for that Purpose.
                            When he was at <placeName>Senegal</placeName>, the <name>Moors</name> were very much encouraged by the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Traders to
                            make War on the Negroes, as Slaves were wanted for the Market; they did so, and <persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName>
                            saw several brought in more or less wounded; among whom were many Women and Children,
                            and the Women were in great Affliction.
                        </p>
                        <p>A Third way is by private kidnapping; they seize one another in the Night when they have
                            Opportunity, and sometimes they invite each other to their Houses, and there detain and sell them
                            to the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Traders. The Number of Persons so kidnaped is considerable, and of this Practice
                            he has seen two instances himself. and it appeared to him to be a common Practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Way is by Accusations by the King, or by each other (frequently false) for various
                            Crimes; in consequence of which the Person accused is sold. If a Person in a Village offends
                            against the King, it serves him as a Pretence for seizing the whole Village and selling them. When a
                            Merchant has Goods to sell, and the Person who wishes to buy them cannot pay immediately, it is
                            usual to give some Person, perhaps a Relation, as an Hostage or Security for the Payment, and 
                            this Person when not redeemed is sold. These are all the Modes <persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> knows of in which
                            Slaves are made.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> being asked, whether the prince of the Country is the Person who sells the
                            Slaves, or Individuals? replied, Both; the Person who has or makes the Slave sells him. The
                            Princes however sell the greatest Number. <persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> does not exactly know how many
                            Slaves were sold from this Part of the Coast whilst he was there, but was credibly informed that
                            not more than 600 Slaves were annually exported from the Coast between <placeName>Goree</placeName> and <placeName>Gambia</placeName>;
                            and that at <placeName>Senegal</placeName> about 2,000 are sold. He cannot speak with Accuracy as the Proportion of
                            Men, Women, and Children; the Number of Women and Children was about equal. The Slaves he
                            saw expressed the greatest Concern and Apprehension at the Loss of their Liberty. Many of those
                            he visited in his physical Capacity, on his feeling their Pulse and examining them, trembled with
                            Fear, thinking he was a Purchaser, and would send them to the Islands, which they dread.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName> being asked if the Inhabitants of these Countries appeared to him to be happy?
                            replied, Very much so, if Idleness, Ease, Plenty of Food, and few Wants, constitute Happiness,

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has always understood one of the Modes of making Slaves to be from the
                            Kings and great Men breaking up a Village; that is, setting Fire to it, sometimes in their own
                            Country, sometimes in the Country of others (but oftener in their own), and seizing the People
                            as they escape from the Fire. He never was present himself when this was done, as it is generally 
                            done in the Night, but has been very near the Spot, and heard that it had been done. He saw
                            many Slaves who told him they had been taken in that manner. The Practice is notorious; it is
                            sometimes done from Resentment, but more often for the Purpose of getting Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked in what other Manner Slaves are procured? replied, Every Person who commits
                            any Sort of Crime is sold for a Slave. Crimes that used formerly to be punished in different
                            Ways are now punished in this. They rarely punish with Death. He remembers <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">a man who
                            had committed Murder</ecda:anonPers>, and made his Escape to <placeName>Goree</placeName> to avoid being sold for a Slave, and
                            recollects that this Man returned to the Continent when the Ships were gone. Formerly the 
                            Punishment for all crimes was commuted for a certain Number of Cattle or Quantity of Grain, which
                            was either paid by the Offender or by his Family, in case of his Incapacity. Murder was generally
                            punished with Death; but since the Introduction of the Slave Trade, not only all Crimes are
                            punished by Slavery, but even the most trivial Offences are punished in the same Manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Mode by which the People of the Country are sometimes made Slaves is by the wandering
                            Tribes of <name>Moors</name> who inhabit the North Side of the <placeName>Niger</placeName>, and cross to the <placeName>Guinea</placeName>, and
                            make what Slaves they can, whom they sell to the <name>Europeans</name>. These generally consist of Women
                            and Children, whom they steal out of the Villages while the Men are at Work in the Fields.
                        </p>
                        <p>Domestic Slavery is common in this Country, but these Slaves are treated with great Mildness:
                            Some of these are born Slaves, and some become Slaves to the King, from bot being able to pay
                            their Fine to the King. These become a Sort of Troops, and are employed, among other Things,
                            in breaking up Villages. None of those who are taken by breaking up Villages ever remain in the 
                            Country; they are all sold to Foreign Traders.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pb/>
                        
                        <p>Being asked if the King ever sells any of those Slaves who belong peculiarly to him? <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName>
                            said, he believed he sometimes does, but very seldom. It is a Disgrace to the Family to
                            which the Slave belongs that he should be sold out of the Country. It sometimes happens that
                            People of the first Consequence become Slaves to the King.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> having described the Natives as a humane and gentle People, of soft and inoffensive
                            Manners, was asked how he reconciled their Gentleness of Manners with the Conduct of 
                            their Kings and great Men who sell their People for Slaves? and replied, He believed they were
                            guilty of these Barbarities only to procure <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity>, of which the whole Nation is passionately fond.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked if the People were much given to War? said, He believes they hardly ever go to
                            War but in Revenge for some Depredation committed, or in order to make Slaves; and these
                            Wars seldom last longer than Two or Three Days. The Prisoners made in War who are not sold,
                            are redeemed by Cattle, and sometimes exchanged; a Freeman is redeemed by Two Slaves. It is
                            by no Means true that the Prisoners taken in War are put to Death, if not sold to the <name>Europeans</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Number of Slaves sold out of the District he was in is not a great many, <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName>
                            imagines between 400 and 500 in a Year, but cannot speak positively. The Slaves our Traders
                            purchase are paid for by Exchange of <ecda:commodity>Cotton Stuffs</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Fire Arms</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Gunpowder</ecda:commodity>, and chiefly <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity>:
                            They are purchased on the King and of the great Men, and sometimes of Individuals: They sell
                            each other as they can. <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> heard from <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="captain">a Captain of a Ship</ecda:anonPers> of <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">One Brother</ecda:anonPers> who had <!-- both brothers are eventually enslaved. Should they have the a-status="enslaved" attribute? -->
                            sold another, and was himself afterwards sentenced by <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="alcaide" a-gender="male">the Alcaide</ecda:anonPers> to be sold, as a Punishment for
                            having sold <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">his Brother</ecda:anonPers>. The Alcaide and the chief Men of the Village shared the Profits among
                            themselves. The Two Brothers were put on Board the same Ship, as he was told, and are now
                            Slaves upon the same Plantation in <placeName>Tobago</placeName>. <persName>Mr Dalrymple</persName> believes this to be a common
                            Practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Kings, or chief Men, bring Slaves to Market, and cannot sell them, they are kept for
                            another Opportunity; but if they are so old as not to be saleable, <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has heard they
                            are sometimes put to Death.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Question being asked of the different Nations of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, what is the Proportion in which
                            each Nation buys Slaves on the Coast? <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> said, The <name>English</name> and the <name>French</name> chiefly
                            carry on the Trade here, but he did not know in what Proportion.

                        <p>In general a Fourth Part of the Slaves are Delinquents, who have committed Offences against the
                            Customs of the Country, or their respective masters, and are thought improper to remain in the
                            Villages. These are ordered to be sold openly, and without any Form of Trial. Their Delinquencies
                            are for the most Part Disobedience to their Masters, Negligence, Drunkenness, and Intrigues
                            with Women. The Crime of Witchcraft is unknown in these Countries.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> believes, that Two Fourths more are Slaves born and bred in the Country as
                            Stock; the other Fourth Part he believes to be Prisoners made in the Wars, which are stirred up
                            by the <name>Europeans</name> by Means of Liquor; on which Occasions the <rs type="properAdjective">Europeans</rs> Traders go on Shore and
                            purchase the Prisoners on both Sides. Being asked whether the Kings of these Countries permit
                            these Practices? he replied, the Kings of these Countries do not prevent it, because they
                            receive Customs from the Slaves so made.
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides the above, there is a Number equal to One Eighth Part of those before spoken of who
                            are brought from the interior Country, particularly from the Country of the <name>Sierrieurs</name>, whom the
                            <name>Moors</name> steal and take away by Force.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Kingdoms of <placeName>Demel</placeName>, <placeName>Tin</placeName>, <placeName>Barbessin</placeName>, and <placeName>Barra</placeName>, there are great Numbers of native Slaves
                            which are bred for the Purpose of Sale. <persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> being asked if they had a right to sell them
                            as they please, either among themselves, or to Foreigners? replied, They sell them commonly,
                            and the Slaves had rather be sold to any body than the <name>Moors</name>, who treat them with extreme
                            Cruelty. With respect to their Treatment by their Masters in their own Country, they have less
                            Comfort, with full as severe Treatment, as every he saw exercised in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. The 
                            Masters are uncontrolled in the Punishment of them; they have Power of Life and Death over
                            them, which they frequently exercise.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr Poplett</persName> said, it was impossible for him to ascertain the Number of Slaves exported: They
                            are purchased principally by the <name>French</name>, some by the <name>English</name>, the <name>Danes</name>, and the <name>Ostenders</name>.
                            They are purchased of the King, the Alcaide, and of their respective Masters. There are no
                            Black Traders on this Part of the Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether the Slaves shew Reluctance or Pleasure at being purchased by the <name>Europeans</name>?
                            <persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> replied, Great Reluctance; for the Masters or Priests hold out as a general
                            Doctrine to their Slaves, that the <name>Europeans</name> will kill and eat them, if they behave so ill as they
                            do to their respective masters, by which Means the Slaves are kept in better Order, and in great
                            Fear of being sold to the <name>Europeans</name>. This Doctrine is generally believed in that Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
                            and has a very political Effect on the Minds of these People.

                        </p>
                        <p><persName>General Rooke</persName> did not particularly observe while he was at <placeName>Goree</placeName>, in what Manner the Slave
                            Trade was carried on; he recollects receiving a Message from the <persName>King of <name>Demel</name></persName>, to acquaint him
                            that he had some Slaves to dispose of, if there were any <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Traders there to purchase them. The
                            Number was Twenty, and they were purchased at the Rate of 20l. per Head on an Average.
                            With respect to the Manner in which the Slaves sold at <placeName>Goree</placeName> were made so, the Report of the
                            Island of <placeName>Goree</placeName> was, that when a Ship arrived to purchase Slaves, the <persName>King of <placeName>Demel</placeName></persName> sent to the
                            Chiefs of the Villages in his Dominions to send him a given Number of Slaves; but if they
                            were not to be procured on this Requisition, the King went to War till e got the Number he
                            wanted. This Report was confirmed to <persName>General Rooke</persName> by Three <name>Marabous</name>, whom the King
                            sent to him.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>General Rooke</persName> was not acquainted from his own knowledge with any other Manner in
                            which Slaves are made. A Proposition was made to him by an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Merchant (who used as
                            an Argument that it had been done in the Time of other Governors) to invite a Number of
                            Negroes to an Entertainment, and then send them on Board some Ship and sell them. <persName>General
                            Rooke</persName> refused the Proposition with Indignation; and upon enquiring from the <name>Marabous</name>, he did not
                            find that such a Thing had ever been done; he heard that there had been Two Battles fought
                            on the Continent, during his Stay at <placeName>Goree</placeName>, for Slaves, as was told it was not an uncommon
                            Practice to make War for that Purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>The General being asked if he had any further Information to give on the Subject of the Slave
                            Trade on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>? replied, That very little Trade was carried on During his Stay
                            there; he had therefore nothing to add, to what he already said upon this Subject.

                        </p>
                        <p>Soon after he commanded at <placeName>Goree</placeName>, <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a Slave</ecda:anonPers> was brought thither by <ecda:persGroup a-occupation="guard">Two of the <persName>King of
                            <placeName>Demel</placeName>'s</persName> private Guards</ecda:persGroup>. He found that it had always been customary for every Thing that was
                            brought to the Island for Sale to be first brought to the House of the Commandant, as nothing
                            was allowed to be sold but by Permission of the Commandant. He had the Curiosity to ask the
                            Two Guards abovementioned, though the Means of the Interpreter, what the former Condition 
                            of the Slave had been? They said, that he was a free Man subject to the <persName>King of <placeName>Demel</placeName></persName>, but
                            had fallen under his Displeasure for having set a Corn Field on Fire belonging to the King. That
                            they never enquire, in such Cases, whether it was by Accident or Design; the Man must equally
                            be answerable. There being no <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Trader on the Coast, the Man was carried back, and
                            <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> hopes he was released, but never heard any more of him.

                        <p>Before he arrived at <placeName>Goree</placeName>, <persName>Captain William Lacy</persName> of the <orgName>African Corps</orgName>, who was the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
                            Commandant at <placeName>Goree</placeName>, had sent a <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="courier" a-religion="mahometan" a-gender="male"><rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Courier</ecda:anonPers> by Land to some <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Traders at the
                            <placeName>River Gambia</placeName> on the King's Service. The Courier was intercepted on his Return with Letters
                            directed to the Commandant, and sold to one <persName>Rouchand</persName>, who commanded a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Polacre lying
                            at <placeName>Pontuval</placeName>, about Ten Leagues to the Southward of <placeName>Goree</placeName>. The Courier spoke <name>French</name>,
                            and fortunately for him could write, and sent a Letter to the Commandant at <placeName>Goree</placeName>, which fell
                            into <persName>Captain Wilson's</persName> Hands, letting him know his Situation. He immediately sent <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="courier">a Courier</ecda:anonPers>
                            to <persName>Rouchand</persName> to demand, in his Majesty's Name, that he should be given up. The Courier he
                            sent to <persName>Rouchand</persName> was a Man who knew the other, and could identify his Person. <persName>Rouchand</persName> 
                            refused to deliver him up, or to suffer <persName>Captain Wilson's</persName> Courier to see him, contenting himself
                            with sending a verbal Answer, That it was true he had bought a Person of that Description, but did
                            not know he was a Courier or free Man, and that he should not do Justice to his Owners in 
                            giving him up. Upon this, <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> determined to go over with his Ship and seize by Force the
                            Courier sent by <persName>Captain Lacy</persName>, but before he had executed this Intention, <persName>Rouchand</persName> sent over his
                            Long-boat with is Mate, &amp;c. to fetch off some Goods he had left upon the Island; upon which
                            <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> detained the Goods and the Mate, but suffered the Long-boat to go away with a 
                            Letter from the mate, letting <persName>Rouchand</persName> know his Situation, and that he should be detained 'till
                            <persName>Captain Lacey's</persName> Courier was returned with his Letters in Safety to the Garrison. <persName>Rouchand</persName> refused
                            for some Time, but after a Fortnight sent the Man back in Irons, and in a very bad Condition.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Wilson</persName> cannot tell by whom the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Courier was seized; but they were Natives,

                            replied, No other within his own Knowledge that relates to the manner of making Slaves by
                            the Natives.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the general manner of making Slaves, he made, while he was there, particular
                            Enquiry from intelligent Persons, and was informed, that when they were at War, they
                            made Prisoners and sold them; and when they were not at War they made no Scruple of taking
                            any of their own Subjects and selling them, even whole Villages at once.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, if he had any Reason to suppose that this was practised in any other Country in
                            <placeName>Africa</placeName>, except the Kingdom of <placeName>Demel</placeName>? <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> said, No. His Enquiry was confined to
                            the Kingdom of <placeName>Demel</placeName>, which he believes is a large and populous Country. He has been Seven
                            or Eight Miles inland, attended by 400 or 500 Men, and treated with great Respect. The King
                            is attended by Guards dressed in the old <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> Stile; he has been told that the King can bring
                            70,000 or 80,000 Men into the Field: He has Deputies in each District to collect his Revenues,
                            which are paid in Kind.

                        <p><persName>Captain Hills</persName> being asked, what he had observed of the Manner in which the Slaves
                            purchased on the Coast became so? replied, at <placeName>Goree</placeName> there was very little Trade while he was
                            there, but he had an Opportunity on the Coast of observing the Manner in which Slaves were
                            made. There was scarcely an Evening in which he did not see People go out in War Dresses to
                            obtain Slaves from the neighbouring Villages. This he understood form one of the Chiefs was
                            done by the King's Orders, who at that Time was very poor, from our annual Presents not being
                            given to him as usual. He was particularly desirous of getting some Black Volunteers to serve <!-- i'm using "Black Volunteers as basis for a-arc two lines down, but feel free to disagree with me. -->
                            on Board his Ship, as it was War Time, and his Crew a bad one. The Consequence was, that
                            one Night they brought <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved" a-arc="black">a Man</ecda:anonPers> to him with his Arms tied behind him; <persName>Captain Hills</persName> rejected him,
                            as his was not a trading Vessel. They requested he would suffer the Man to stay all Night, and
                            <persName>Governor Wall</persName> would take him in the Morning. He ordered him to be released from his 
                            confined State, and fed. The next Morning they came for him, when he jumped overboard, and
                            swam to the Shore. They pursued him, but were not able to come up with him till he had reached
                            the Shore; there they caught him, but he was rescued by the Natives of the Village to which he
                            swam. It appeared that this Man had been kidnapped without Authority from the King. This
                            was the only Instance he knew, of his own Knowledge, of Persons being kidnapped. He never
                            saw the Parties that went out return with Slaves, but often saw Slaves in their Huts tied Back
                            to Back.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked with what View these Slaves are made so, as he had stated that there were no
                            Traders there at the Time he was at <placeName>Goree</placeName>? He replied, He believed they were intended to be
                            sent to <persName>Governor Wall</persName>, who was a great Trader. The Chiefs told him they were for <persName>Governor
                            Wall</persName>. <persName>Captain Hills</persName> received on Board his Ship One Volunteer, who came to <placeName>England</placeName> with
                            him. Being asked if he knew of any other Method by which Slaves were made? <persName>Captain Hills</persName>
                            replied, Not at <placeName>Goree</placeName>. In the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>, <persName>Captain Hills</persName> and <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="lieutenant">his Lieutenant</ecda:anonPers> each of them 
                            wanted a Boy as Servant; <ecda:anonPers a-arc="black" a-occupation="pilot">a Black Pilot</ecda:anonPers> who was on Board offered to get them One; and the
                            Method he proposed was, that <persName>Captain Hills</persName> should send his Boat towards the Shore, and the Boys,
                            not knowing what they were to be brought there fore, were to be seduced on Board. In this Manner
                            the Traders procured Slaves. <persName>Captain Hills</persName> met with <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">a Man</ecda:anonPers>, who told him he had been
                            kidnapped and carried away by a <rs type="properAdjective">Bristol</rs> Vessel; but that <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="governor">one of the Governors</ecda:anonPers> in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>,
                            on hearing his Story, would not suffer him to be sold, but sent him back to his own Country.
                            This is all the Information he has to give respecting the Way of making Slaves, or on the Slave
                            Trade.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Hills</persName> being asked whether his Crew were healthy while he remained on the Coast?
                            replied, He did not lose a single Man; but he attributed it to the Precaution he took of making
                            the Men he sent on Shore take the Bark before they went, and on their Return. He always himself
                            saw them take it. Being asked whether there were any Slave Ships in the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName> while
                            he was there? he replied, There were Two <name>Danes</name> (which he sent away by Order of <persName>Commodore
                            Shirley</persName>), and two <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Vessels. Being asked whether the Crews of those Vessels were as healthy 
                            as his was? he replied, By no Means; the Mate, and Three or Four of the Crew belonging to
                            One of them, died; and they made frequent Applications to <persName>Captain Hills</persName> to assist them in 
                            navigating their Ships down the River, in Consequence of their Want of Hands, occasioned by their
                            Sickliness: The <name>Danes</name> were particularly unhealthy. Being asked, whether he could assign any
                            Reason for the Difference in point of Health between his own Crew and those of the above-
                            mentioned Vessels? <persName>Captain Hills</persName> replied, much greater Care is taken of the Men on Board the
                            King's Ships than in Merchant Ships, and the latter were longer in the River, and higher up it.

                        <p>At <placeName>Gambia</placeName> they have Slaves among them, but they are treated more as Servants than Slaves:
                            They sell them sometimes for Slaves, and will continue to do so as long as the Slave Trade
                            continues; for whenever they want <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity> they condemn them under slight Pretences in order to sell
                            them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pb/>
                        
                        <p><persName>Mr. Gandy</persName> never heard of Wars either on the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>, or <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, nor of
                            Villages being burnt, or Ravages made in the Country, to procure Slaves. He saw no Appearance
                            of Hostility or Dissentions among the Towns. He believes the Slaves come from a great Distance.
                            The Black Merchants bring them down the River in Canoes; they are paid for in different
                            Merchandizes, which are sent up the Country. At <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> the Slaves were procured 
                            by White People, <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> or <rs type="properAdjective">Irish</rs>, settled there, who brought them to the Ship to sell. The
                            Landlords or Natives procure them for these White People from the interior Parts of the Country,
                            but <persName>Mr. Gandy</persName> can give no Account how these Slaves were originally procured. Assortments of
                            India, and different Sorts of Goods are necessary for the Purchase of Slaves, which they rate at a
                            supposed Value of Iron Bars.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves of <placeName>Gambia</placeName> are the finest men in the World, Coal Black, and very active; at <placeName>Sierra
                            Leone</placeName> they are not in general so fine; they look dejected and sullen when they go on Board.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Gandy</persName> being asked, what becomes of the Slaves that are not bought? replied, They
                            generally are bought; but he remembers an Instance of <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">an old Man at <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName></ecda:anonPers>, who was
                            offered to several Ships, but was rejected by all; which Man they dissected and threw overboard.

                        <p>The Country all the Way up the River is very populous. The natives live, some in large
                            Towns, and some in Villages. The Trade in Slaves as very much declined within these few Years.
                            <persName>Captain Heatley</persName> remembers, Seventeen or Eighteen Years ago, when 2,500 Slaves were exported
                            annually; it has fallen off every Year, and now not above 1,200 or 1,400 are exported; of these
                            we have still the largest Share. The <name>French</name> carry on their Trade chiefly in the lower Part of the
                            River. <persName>Captain Heatley</persName> does not know the exact Proportion exported by each Nation, but
                            believes the <name>English</name> have still the largest Share.
                        </p>
                        <p>A very small Proportion of the Slaves are Natives of the Countries on the Banks of the River.
                            These are Delinquents convicted of Crimes, such as Theft, Adultery, Murder, Witchcraft. He
                            believes there are some also who are sold for Debt. They have a form of Trial before the Kings
                            or Governors, and he never knew them sold without it.
                        </p>
                        <p>He never knew that any were kidnapped. It is impossible for an <name>European</name> to kidnap them,
                            and he never heard of a single Instance of their being kidnapped by each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a great Number of born Slaves in these Countries. The Number of Slaves the
                            Traders purchase, bears but a small Proportion to the Numbers employed in the Plantations in the
                            Country; and it is not uncommon for a Man to have 500; sometimes there are 1000 Slaves
                            working in the Corn and Rice Fields of their Masters. These are sold at Pleasure, and are
                            exchanged for Cattle of all Sorts. <persName>Captain Heatley</persName> knew an Instance of Forty Slaves being paid 
                            for a Barbary Horse. The only Restriction on the Sale of Slaves is a Duty paid on the Sale to
                            the Prince of a Country. A Freeman convicted of some Crimes and condemned to be sold,
                            may be redeemed by an Exchange of Two Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Heatley</persName> being asked if there is any Peculiarity in the Punishment for Witchcraft
                            different from other Crimes? said, He had known an Instance when, for want of Witnesses upon an
                            Accusation of Witchcraft, the accused had been tried by an Ordeal of Fire and Water. In the
                            first Case, they apply a hot Iron to the Hand of the Person accused, and if it does not burn him
                            while the Executioner is making a Speech, he is acquitted; if burnt, he is found guilty. In the
                            Ordeal of Water, they make the accused drink a vast Quantity of Water witch is called Red
                            Water, and which is of a poisonous Quality; if they discharge the Water without Mischief, they
                            are acquitted. He conceives that in both Instances some Art is used to prevent the Effect, though
                            sometimes without Success. When the accused are found guilty, they are either whipped to Death
                            or sold for Slaves, and frequently the whole Family is involved in the Punishment. These
                            Accusations are very frequent.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves brought from the interior Part of the Country are purchased of their Master, who is
                            sometimes a <name>Pagan</name>, but generally a <name>Mahometan</name>; but there is a Broker between the Buyer and the
                            Seller. <persName>Captain Heatley</persName> has been told, that those slaves come from a very great Distance. They
                            are sometimes Three, Four, and Five Months coming from the high Country. Their Appearance
                            varies little, but their Language is very different; it is very common that they do not understand
                            each other. There are but few Women, and fewer Children; the Children are purchased by the
                            Natives themselves in their Passage down to the River. Captain Heatley was informed by these
                            Black Traders, that some of these Slaves become so by being Delinquents, some Prisoners made
                            in War, and some sold by their Masters for Merchandize, and for different Reasons. He has
                            heard from these Traders, that the System of Slavery prevails universally in the interior Parts
                            of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and as far as his own Knowledge goes, it certainly does prevail.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked if he had ever learnt from the Traders, that any Trade in Slaves was carried
                            on in Caravans to the upper Parts of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> or the States of <placeName>Barbary</placeName> in the <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>?
                            he replied, He had frequently heard from those Traders, that Slaves are carried to the opposite
                            Part of the Continent, to what they call White People, by which they mean People whiter
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            than themselves. He supposes them to be the People of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, or of the <placeName>Barbary Coast</placeName>. He
                            knew a <name>Jew</name> who came down from <placeName>Mogadore</placeName> on the <placeName>Coast of Barbary</placeName> to <placeName>Goree</placeName>, and who travelled
                            by Land through the Country for the Purposes of Trade.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Heatley</persName> being asked if he had ever heard of White People who live in the interior Parts 
                            of <placeName>Africa</placeName>? replied, He had never heard of White People, but had seen People on the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>
                            who had Complexions much lighter than the Natives, and who had the Features of <name>Europeans</name>,
                            and long Hair. He could not tell from whence these People came, but supposed they probably
                            were <name>Moors</name>. These People sometimes trade for Slaves. Being asked if he apprehended that
                            these People are generally Slave Merchants? said, he believed they generally came for the Purchase
                            of Gold; but sometimes they invest their Property in Slaves, which they sell to the <name>Europeans</name> 
                            for Merchandize, and then with that Merchandize purchase Gold and young Slaves,
                            which they carry back to their own Country. He cannot exactly say what other Articles they
                            bring form their own Country to trade with, but believes Salt is One of the Articles. Being 
                            asked if these Traders ever gave him any Account of their Journey, or described the Countries
                            they passed through, or mentioned any great Mountains or Rivers? he replied, He never could
                            get any Thing satisfactory from them on that Head. Being asked whether the Slaves Generally
                            appeared to be in good Condition, or whether emaciated and weak? he said, They were very
                            different, sometimes in good Order, sometimes in bad.

                        <p>The Articles with which the <name>Europeans</name> purchase Slaves, are <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Manufactures, and <rs type="properAdjective">East
                            India</rs> Goods and Spirits. He believes the Manufactures and <rs type="properAdjective">India</rs> Goods are carried far up the
                            Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves that are brought from the interior Country appear happy at being brought, and
                            when once on Board express great Reluctance on being put on Shore again. Those who are
                            purchased on the Banks of the River, and are Natives of that Country, would be glad, he supposes,
                            to get away again; sometimes they are dejected, and sometimes not so.

                        <p>The Manner in which the Trade in Slaves is carried on in the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName> was stated by
                            <persName>Captain Heatley</persName> to be as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>When a Ship arrives in the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName> she comes to an Anchor at <placeName>Gillofree Port</placeName>,
                            in the Kingdom of <placeName>Barra</placeName>, opposite <placeName>James Fort</placeName> on the <placeName>James's Island</placeName>, Nine or Ten Leagues from the
                            Entrance. You send your Boat on Shore to acquaint the Alkaide or Mayor of the Town of your
                            Arrival; he in common returns with the boat, and receives from you Anchorage-money. Ten
                            Gallons of <ecda:commodity>Liquor</ecda:commodity> for the King, Value 30s. and Two <ecda:commodity>Iron Bars</ecda:commodity> for himself, value 7s. and perhaps
                            Presents, a few Bottles of <ecda:commodity>Wine</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Beer</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Cyder</ecda:commodity>, &amp;c. He immediately dispatches Messengers
                            with the Liquor as above to the King, informing that such Vessel is Arrived, and only waits to
                            pay his Customs, intending to proceed up the River. The King consults his Councillors
                            for a proper Day to receive the same, and sends Word to the Alcaide accordingly. After a
                            Detention of Four, Five, Six, and Seven Days, he sends his People to receive his Custom, 140
                            Bars in Merchandize, Amount Sterling on an Average 16l. An <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Ship seldom or Ever
                            meets with Trade here; the <name>French</name> (who have their King's Resident at <placeName>Albreda</placeName>, a Town in

                        <p>The First Linguist's Employment is in the Ship; he interprets between the Broker (who in general
                            sells the Slaves for the Owner) and the Factor, Trader, or Master of the Ship. The Second

                            or Factory on Shore. Messengers are employed looking for Trade on Shore, Slaves, Ivory,

                        <p>Thus provided at <placeName>Gillofree</placeName>, we proceed up the River, and after a Passage of Six, Seven, or

                            of the River, paying Anchorage Five Gallons of Liquor and One Iron Bar. We send
                            Messengers to the principal People Twenty or Thirty Miles round, acquainting of the Arrival
                            of the Ship, and soliciting their Assistance for Dispatch, Our Tender or Long-boat is 
                            dispatched up the River to the different Ports of Trade, with a regular Assortment of Merchandise.
                            It is at this Port that Ships from <placeName>Europe</placeName> in general begin and finish their Trade.

                        <p>We in common begin with single Trade, that is, One, Two, or Three Slaves, brought from
                            One Broker, called by the Natives a Slattee; Coffil Trade (but from what Language the Word
                            Coffil is derived <persName>Captain Heatley</persName> is at a Loss), is called by the Natives <distinct rend="italic">Seton</distinct>, and may be better
                            understood in <placeName>Europe</placeName> as a Caravan, or large Bodies of Slaves, from 200 to 300, marched down
                            from the interior Parts of the Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Broker or Slattee is the Person who collects the Slaves together in the interior Parts of the 
                            Country; he perhaps gives a small Premium to the Slave Owners, and engages to convey them
                            and their Slaves down to the Banks of the River, clear of all Incumbrance; that is, he discharges
                            all Duties, Fees, &amp;c. he is subject to in passing through the different Kingdoms. He
                            finds them Provision on their Journey down; on their Return, they are to find themselves
                            Provision; but he is bound by Engagements to return with them, and keep them free from every
                            Demand as above: For the Performance of his Engagements, he receives a Custom or Brokerage
                            on each Slave from the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Trader, which is (or more properly was originally) deducted
                            out of the Price of the Slave. The Price varies according to the Scarcity and Demand for
                            them.

                        </p>
                        <p>We are now entering on Trade. The Linguist brings the Broker on Board, or to your Factory,
                            who gives notice that he has a Slave to sell, enquires the Price you mean to give the Master of the
                            Slave, and the Custom he is to have; this is very seldom settled until he has visited all the Ships
                            and Factories at the Port. When he finds he has no better Offer, he brings the Slave Owner
                            on Board, who examines the Quantity of your Merchandize, fixes upon the principal Articles of
                            the Assortment, and sends for the Slave; the Surgeon examines the Slave; if approved of, we
                            immediately pay the Owner from 10l. to 20l. Value in Merchandize, stopping One Bar Duty for
                            the King, Prince, &amp;c. The Man that collects the Duty is called by the Natives Tabob Manson,
                            In <name>English</name>, the White Man's King, and to whom the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Traders pay Half a Bar, or One
                            Shilling, for every Slave they purchase. The Slave Owner having received his Goods as agreed
                            on, he calls for a <distinct rend="italic">Courit a Curt</distinct>, (which signifies, in the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Language, loosing the Slaves from
                            their Rope), and is done by presenting him Trading Knives, Half a Bar of <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Paper</ecda:commodity>, &amp;c.;
                            without this, his Deed of Delivery is not perfect; with it, he finally concludes his Part of the
                            Bargain, and carries his Merchandize on Shore. The Slave, if a Man, is put in Irons on the
                            Main Deck; if a Boy, he is put on the Main Deck loose; if a Woman or Girl, they are placed
                            (without Irons) on the Quarter Deck.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Broker or Slattee now receives his Custom or Brokerage for the One Slave bought, which
                            finishes the Purchase of a single Slave. The Cossil Trade differs very little from the single,  
                            having the same ceremony, shewing the Goods, fixing the Price to the Owner, and the Custom
                            to the Broker or Slattee. Proce and principal Articles once fixed upon, it seldom varies,
                            purchasing 30, 40, or 50 Slaves a Day. When the Coffil is finished, we way the Slattee all this
                            Brokerage Dues, the King his Duty Bars, and Tabob Manson his Dues; and it is in the foregoing
                            Mode, and no other, that the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Trader can obtain a Cargo of Slaves in the <placeName>River

                            Kings, and sold when they are in want of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Commodities.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Information chiefly applies to <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>; bu the same Account was given to <persName>Sir George
                            Yonge</persName> all along the Coast. He does not speak from his own Knowledge, but from Information
                            given him by the Kings of the Country, and by <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> resident there, and particularly from an
                            American Trader of the Name <persName>Pintard</persName>, who had resided Fourteen Years in the Country, and
                            was a sensible Man.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Sir George</persName> saw a beautiful Child about Five Years old, brought from the <placeName>Bullam Shore</placeName>, which 
                            is the opposite Shore to <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>. As the Child was too young to be an Object of Trade, the
                            Persons who had him to sell gave him to Food, and threatened to throw him into the River. Sir
                            George, to save his Life, offered a Quarter Cask of <ecda:commodity>Madeira</ecda:commodity> for him, which was accepted and
                            brought him to <placeName>England</placeName>, and made a Present of him to the <persName>Marquis of Lansdowne</persName>:—He understood
                            this Child had been kidnapped.
                        </p>
                        <p>Several Canoes came down the River St. André, on the Grain Coast, in which were the finest
                            Men he ever saw, many of whom measured Seven Feet high. They were very apprehensive of
                            being <distinct rend="italic">Panyared</distinct>, and would not come on board his ship till they were satisfied it was a King's Ship,
                            for which they have a great Respect, and in which they place great Confidence.—These Men
                            were Negroes.

                        <p><persName>Sir George Yonge</persName> cannot say, positively, whether Wars are made in these Countries merely for
                            the Purpose of obtaining Slaves; neighbouring States will naturally have Causes of Quarrel
                            between them, but he believes the Wars have been increased by the Trade with <name>Europeans</name>. At a
                            Place near <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName> lived a <persName>Mr. Brue</persName>, an <rs type="properAdjective">Irish</rs> Trader, who lives very magnificently. When
                            <persName>Sir George</persName> came into his Hall, he was surrounded by a great Number of Negroes, Subjects of
                            different Kings, who demanded whether he came as a Friend to <persName>Mr. Brue</persName>, or an Enemy; on his
                            saying he came as a Friend, they were satisfied. These Men were making War on some neighbouring
                            States for the purpose of procuring Slaves, as there were a great many Ships then lying
                            in the Road. They brought <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="princes">Three Princes</ecda:persGroup> as Hostages and Pledges for the Payment of Goods
                            that <persName>Mr. Brue</persName> had advanced to them for the Purpose of carrying on the War.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Sir George Yonge</persName> believes that the Kings of these Countries have some Slaves distinct from their
                            Subjects, but not in great Numbers. These Slaves are chiefly sent them as Presents.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Sir George Yonge</persName> being asked whether the Subjects of any of these States kidnapped each
                            other, or only the Subjects of different States?—replied, They generally kidnap the Subjects of
                            different States. the Sovereign of the State would not allow his Subjects to kidnap their Fellow
                            Subjects, as he would be a Loser by it; but the Sovereign probably either authorizes the kidnapping
                            the People belonging to other States, or connives at it, because he has a Custom or Duty on
                            every Slave brought into his Country.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Sir George Yonge</persName> is of Opinion that more Female Slaves might be obtained than the
                            Ships no take, as he has known some refused; but he does not believe they could obtain as
                            many Females as Males.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> believes One Mode of the People upon the Coast becoming Slaves, is by Wars,
                            which are made by One Country that is poor against another, in order to obtain Slaves to sell to
                            the Factories and the Ships. He does not know the Name of the Country that made the war, but
                            remembers <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">a Man</ecda:anonPers> being brought on board his Ship, while he was lying off the <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName>,
                            with a bad Wound in his Head: The man told him he was wounded, taken and made a Slave of
                            in the War, not being able to get away on Account of his Wound. The Man did not tell him
                            any Particulars of the War, nor of the Cause of it, as <persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> recollects; he does not remember
                            any other Instance of that Kind while he was on the Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Mode is by being trepanned by other Natives of the Country: He learned this from
                            Conversation with some who said they had been trepanned; but <persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> never saw an Instance
                            of it.—Being asked whether the Governments of the Country do not endeavour to prevent this 
                            Practice? <persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> said, he did not believe they had any Government with sufficient Power to
                            prevent it, not on the Coast where he has been.
                        </p>
                        <p ana="#punishment">Another Mode is by their being condemned to be Slaves for Adultery. The Person accused is
                            tried at the <distinct rend="italic">Palavers</distinct>, (mentioned in the former Part of his Evidence) and he does not believe they
                            are ever pardoned unless they get another Slave to go in their Room. They may sometimes be
                            condemned to Slavery for other Crimes, particularly Theft, but by no Means so frequently as for
                            Adultery. <persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> being asked if they were not sometimes condemned for Witchcraft?—said,
                            He never knew an Instance of it.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> does not know of any other Mode of making Slaves, but they have sometimes
                            brought their Children, from the Age of Ten to Twelve or Fourteen, to the Ships, as Pawns for
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            Goods, with a Promise to redeem them. which they have never done, and the Children have been
                            carried away.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are some born Slaves in this Part of the Country. He does not know that they ever sell
                            these, but thinks it probable they do, for the Man who will pawn his Child will naturally sell his
                            Slave.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves are purchased of the Natives who live on the Water-side, most of whom are
                            Blacks; but there are some few Whites, perhaps One in a Thousand, who are <name>Englishmen</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p>On the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> the Slaves are mostly purchased at the Forts of the <name>English</name> resident there,
                            Who must have purchased them of the Black Traders.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> supposes that some of the Slaves are the People of that Part of the Country, but
                            much the greater Number are People of the interior Country, because they did not speak the 
                            same Language. He has no good information how the Slaves are made that come from the
                            interior Country; they are brought down by the Black Traders he has no Knowledge how these
                            Traders come by them, nor how the Passage of the Slaves is secured in coming Through the
                            different Countries. Being asked what becomes of those Slaves who are brought down to the
                            Coast, and are rejected by the <name>Europeans</name>? he replied, they are generally sold in Lots, and we
                            are obliged to take the bad with the good.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked with what Goods he carried on the Trade, and where he procured these Goods?
                            <persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName> replied, They carried from <rs type="properAdjective">Rhode Island</rs> <ecda:commodity>Rum</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>, and exchanged Part of 
                            these Goods, either at the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Factories, or with <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Ships on the Coast, and with the 
                            remaining <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>, and the Goods so taken in Exchange, they purchased their Slaves. On the
                            <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> purchased them chiefly with <ecda:commodity>Rum</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>.

                        <p>There are frequent Wars in this Country, particularly between the <name>Mahometans</name> and the
                            <name>Pagans</name>, and the Prisoners made in these Wars are sold as Slaves; if they have been Freemen
                            originally, they are frequently redeemed from us by their Friends, who give us other Slaves in
                            return. The general Mode of carrying on War in this Country, and other Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName> is
                            not open and bold, but by Stratagem, and in small Parties: They lie concealed in the Woods
                            which surround the small Villages, and make their Attacks under Cover of the Night, and seize the
                            People by Surprise. Others are sold as Delinquents, and these make the greater Part. <persName>Mr
                            Penny</persName> does not deny but there may be individuals who seize People by Surprise, without Authority
                            from the Government, but these Instances are by no Means frequent, and are severely punished
                            when detected. There are others who are made Slaves in consequence of Gaming, of which they are 
                            very fond. They stake themselves, first a Leg, then an Arm, and lastly the Head, which they
                            reckon equal to all the rest, and when they have lost that, they surrender themselves for Slaves.
                            Supposing a Man to lose a Leg only, in this Mode of Gaming, they continue playing on till they
                            have lost the Whole of themselves, or are cleared.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked whether he did not conceive there would be fewer Wars in this Part of
                            the Country, if the Profit of making Slaves was not one Object to induce them to make War?
                            replied, This may be a concurrent Cause, but he never heard it avowed. Fear, Ambition, Interest,
                            and Resentment are supposed to be the Causes. He rather considers the making Slaves as the Effect,
                            though it may sometimes be a concurrent Cause. He is fully persuaded, this concurrent Cause existed
                            with equal Force, previous to the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Nations having any Commerce with <placeName>Guinea</placeName>, yet he
                            acknowledges, at the present Period, the Articles of Trade brought from <placeName>Europe</placeName> constitute what
                            the <name>Africans</name> most value.
                        </p>
                        <p>But as Wealth, or any supposed Good that influences the Minds of Men, is undoubtedly comparative,
                            he therefore infers, that the inferior Manufactures of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, which it possessed previous
                            to its having any Commerce with the <name>Europeans</name> (which inferior Manufactures consisted of <ecda:commodity>Cotton</ecda:commodity>
                            and <ecda:commodity>Grass Cloth</ecda:commodity>, and <ecda:commodity>Ornaments of Gold</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>) at that remote Period when the <name>Africans</name>
                            could not have an Idea of any thing more perfect or desirable, were certainly as much an Incentive
                            to rouse them to War, as the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Commodities can possibly be now, when become common
                            and familiar among them.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are also native Slaves in this Country; Three Fourths of the Inhabitants are Slaves.
                            Domestic Slavery is very prevalent in this Country, as well in the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Towns as in the
                            Pagan. These domestic Slaves are never sold, except for Crimes. They are tried for their
                            Crimes; and the Number of Slaves is so great, that the Government would be afraid of 
                            committing any Act of Injustice for fear of a Revolt.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Crimes for which a Man becomes a Slave are Murder, Adultery, Witchcraft, and Theft,
                            and sometimes for Debt. For these Crimes they are tried by Eight or Ten of the old Men who are
                            most respected for their Age and Experience, and who are appointed by the Princes and Head
                            Men of the Town, <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not think in general that Delinquencies are imputed in

                            order to make the People Slaves; but there may be profligate wicked Men of Power, who, to
                            gratify their Avarice, may take that Method.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <name>Europeans</name> purchase the Slaves of the Black Traders, who are the Princes and Head Men
                            of those Countries. These Black Traders travel into the interior of Country to purchase them.
                            They obtain Passports from the intermediate States for that purpose. They go to Marts in the
                            interior Part of the Country where the Slaves are sold; and are gone sometimes for a Moon or more.
                            <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> can give no Account of these interior Countries from whence the Slaves are brought.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Number of Slaves annually exported from this Part of the Coast is about 2,500; Two
                            Thirds by the <name>English</name>, the Remainder by the <name>French</name>. Of these 2,500 Slaves, <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> apprehends
                            about Three Fourths come from the interior Country. The Age at which Slaves are generally
                            purchased is from Nine Years old to Thirty.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> Cannot say with Certainty what becomes of those Slaves who are rejected by the <name>Europeans</name>,
                            but has been repeatedly informed that they are destroyed (particularly at <placeName>Angola</placeName>) by
                            the Traders who reside in the interior Country. They Push them down from the Top of a
                            deep Cliff near to the Place where the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Factories are established at <placeName>Melimba</placeName>.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not know that there are any Countries, either upon the Coast, or in the 
                            interior Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, where Slaves are bred for Sale; but observed, that if we take a View of
                            the Whole of the Slave Coast, which runs from Sixteen Degrees North to Sixteen South, making
                            an extent of Coast of about 1,600 Leagues, and compare it with this Country, which is so small
                            in proportion, and consider the Number of Delinquents here, which amount to about 2,000 annually,
                            it is not to be wondered at, that in a Country of that Extent, where there is so little Civilization
                            and such Numbers of People, the Slaves made in consequence of Delinquency should form a large
                            Proportion of the Number annually exported from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, which is computed at 80,000.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, what he supposed in general to be the Population of the Countries he
                            had spoken of, and on what Grounds he formed his Conjecture? replied, It was impossible to
                            answer the Question with any tolerable Exactness, but gave the following Estimate of the Population
                            of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, observing that he gave it with great Diffidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Those who visit <placeName>Africa</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName> will discover, and perhaps be struck with the Appearance
                            of pretty nearly an equal Population in the state of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and those Countries of <placeName>Africa</placeName> which
                            lie upon the Sea Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p><placeName>Virginia</placeName> comprehends about 30,000 square Miles, and including the Negroes, is said to contain
                            about 800,000 Inhabitants; taking this for the Basis of the Calculation, it may reasonably be
                            presumed that <rs type="properAdjective">Negro</rs> Land, which extends from the River Senegal in 16° North to <placeName>Cape Negro</placeName> in
                            16° South Latitude, and from the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> Eastward to the <placeName>Indian Ocean</placeName>, and contains, exclusive
                            of <placeName>Nubia</placeName> and <placeName>Abissinia</placeName>, at least Four Millions of Square Miles, if it be equally populous throughout
                            as it is on the Sea Coast, may have One hundred and six millions of Inhabitants. Notwithstanding
                            the annual Drain of Slaves from this Country, we do not perceive any visible Decrease
                            of Population.

                        <p>A considerable Number of Slaves are procured on this Part of the Coast; and <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName>
                            made it his Object during his residence there, to inform himself how these Slaves were made so.
                            Of the Numbers which are taken from this Country, only a small Part are the Natives of the Sea
                            Coast, some of which are Prisoners made in the Wars which the petty States have with each other.
                            Others are sold for various Crimes, such as Witchcraft, Adultery, &amp;c. &amp;c but the greatest Part
                            are Prisoners made in the Wars of the interior Country, which the Foolahs, a People who profess
                            the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Religion, are perpetually waging against the surrounding Nations, (the Names of
                            which he does not immediately recollect), who refuse to embrace their Doctrine.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> does not apprehend that all the Slaves who are brought from the interior Country
                            are Prisoners made in the Wars carried on by the Foolahs, There are likewise some who are
                            sold for their Crimes, and in Times of Scarcity many Persons sell their Slaves for Salt.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> spoke the Language of the Sea Coast, but not that of those who came from a
                            Distance; and being asked, From whom he learnt the Accounts he had given of the Manner of
                            making Slaves? said, From the Natives of the Sea Coast who travel into the interior Country.
                            He does not believe that these Wars, either on the Sea Coast or in the interior Country, are made
                            for the Purpose of acquiring Slaves; because when he first arrived at <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> in April
                            <date when="1785">1785</date>, he found the Nations to the North and South of that River engaged in War. The War
                            to the Northward was occasioned by <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">a Man of One Tribe</ecda:anonPers> killing <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">a Man of another Tribe</ecda:anonPers>; be
                            fled from their Resentment for Shelter among his own Countrymen, who refused to deliver him
                            up to the Friends of the Deceased, according to the Laws of the Country, and this brought on a
                            general War between the Two nations, and involved others in their Dispute. The war to the
                            Southward of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, which was in <placeName>Sherbro</placeName>, originated from a Quarrel between <ecda:persGroup>Two
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            Headmen</ecda:persGroup>, who were Chiefs in the Village where they resided respectively; their Dispute engaged
                            the whole Country of <placeName>Sherbro</placeName> in Arms against each other.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> is of Opinion, that Wars would be as frequent in these Countries as they now
                            are, if the <name>Europeans</name> did not come to purchase Slaves, as the People are of a very vindictive
                            Disposition.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether he did not conceive that Crimes were very often imputed falsely to those
                            People for the Purpose of making Slaves? said, He did not conceive so from any Instance that
                            ever fell under his Observation.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> speaks from his own Knowledge of the Existence of domestic Slavery upon the
                            Coast, and has heard that it exists also in the interior Part of the Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>These Slaves make Three Fourths of the Inhabitants on this Part of the Coast. They are 
                            employed in Cultivating Lands, and are entirely subject to the Will of their Owners; but they
                            are not severely treated, except for Crimes, for which they are punished without any Form of
                            Trial, according to the Will of their Owners.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Domestic Slaves are born in a Man's Possession, or have been in his Possession for a
                            Twelvemonth, they cannot be sold without the Form of a Trial; but as the Master is both Judge
                            and Accuser, they are condemned of course. <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> has seen this Mode of Trial: There
                            is a Place in the Middle of each Town, (something like a Cockpit here), where the Master sits
                            with the Head Men, who are his Neighbours; the Slave is brought into the Middle and accused
                            of some Crime; Witnesses are examined, and the Master is the chief Judge, though the others
                            give their Opinion, and if the Slave is convicted he is immediately sold. They have certain Forms
                            and Laws handed down by Tradition. <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> cannot say whether all the Crimes for which 
                            a Slave may be sold are specified; but there are many for which it is notorious to every Body they
                            are liable to be sold. They do not punish with Death for any Crime except among the <name>Mundingos</name>.
                            There, in Cases of Poison or Murder, when a Man is condemned, they immediately cut
                            his Throat. The <name>Mundingos</name> are <name>Mahometans</name>. They for a small Part of the Inhabitants of
                            this Part of the Coast, but are propagating their Religion every where. Of the domestic Slaves
                            on this Part of the Coast, the larger Proportion are Natives there, but the Children of those who
                            are brought from the interior Country. The Slaves that are purchased before the rainy Season
                            commences are employed upon their Plantations, and are sold to the <name>Europeans</name>, and sometimes
                            among themselves, from One Master to another, after the Rice is planted. The Seller carries the
                            Manufactures he receives from the <name>Europeans</name>, as the Price of the Slaves, up into the Country in order
                            to purchase others. Some of the Persons in this domestic Slavery are therefor of the same Description
                            with those sold to <name>Europeans</name>. <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> has understood that the same Species of domestic
                            Slavery exists in the interior Country, and to a greater Extent. He does not know whether they are
                            brought into the interior Country from parts still more remote, but has every Reason to believe
                            that Slavery is a Trade carried on throughout the whole Continent. The <name>Europeans</name> purchase the
                            Slaves of Persons resident in the District upon the Coast, except at One Place, viz. the Rio Pongeos,
                            where the Black Merchants come down in Bodies. These Black Merchants are the same
                            who sometimes come down to the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>. It was by Means of these Black Merchants,
                            that the Defeat of the <name>Spaniards</name> before <placeName>Gibralter</placeName> was known upon the Coast within Forty Days
                            after it happened, which shews that they have a Communication with Barbary. The Slaves are
                            distinguished into Two Classes; the House Slave, and the Plantation Slave. The House Slave is
                            considered as Part of the Family, and is educated. The Plantation Slaves live in Towns separate
                            from their Masters, and whatever they have is considered as their master's Property, The Plantations
                            Slaves are employed in cultivating Rice, which they sell to the Ships, and Cotton for their
                            own Consumption.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Rice is cultivated with great Labour, according to their Manner, as they have new
                            Ground to clear every Season. The Slaves go into the Field at Sun-rise, and work till about
                            Ten; but they reckon Time only by the Sun; they have then their Meal, which consists of Rice
                            coked in the Fields; after they have finished their meal, they return to their Labour till Sun-set,
                            and then they get a Second Meal. <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> believes that they work willingly and industriously,
                            at least he never heard that any Compulsion was necessary. They have no Instruments of Husbandry
                            but a Hoe, made of an Irons Bar; and owing to this imperfect Manner of clearing the
                            Ground the Proportion of Produce is very small. Each Slave has Ground to cultivate sufficient for
                            the Subsistence of himself and Family. They marry and have Children, but they take only
                            One Wife; though Polygamy is allowed in the Country, it is practiced only by the Rich. The
                            Slaves never cultivated the same Spot oftener than once in Seven Year;s it lies fallow the other
                            Six. The Land is never taken from them whilst in Cultivation, present Possession being the only
                            Tenure in this Country, nor are their Wives and Children ever taken from them, except for the
                            Crimes before-mentioned.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> had Opportunities of conversing with the Slaves on Board the Ships, but never
                            heard of any other manner in which they became Slaves, than that of being made Prisoners of
                            War, or being sold for Crimes, which they call in general <distinct rend="italic">Palaver</distinct>. He has been told that it was
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            formerly their Practice to put to Death the Prisoners made in War; but they do not do so now,
                            since they have had an Opportunity of selling them to the <name>Europeans</name>; they also sell them among
                            themselves. The Persons resident upon the Coast, go up into the Country to purchase Slaves at
                            all Times of the Year indiscriminately; but the chief Time of selling them upon the Coast is
                            about August and September, which is the rainy season, when they have no Employment for 
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> being asked, if he knew of Persons being put to Death by the Kings, as a Display
                            of Power, or by Way of Sacrifice? replied; From the former Cause he never knew an
                            Instance upon the Sea Coast; he is not acquainted with the Power of the Kings in the interior
                            Country. He knew an Instance of a Man whom they wanted to send out of the Country without
                            selling him, upon Suspicion of Witchcraft: He was offered to <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName>, and upon his Refusal
                            to take the Man, they tied a Stone round his Neck, and threw him into the Sea.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> being asked if he could speak to the Numbers of Slaves annually purchased upon 
                            this Coast? replied; From <placeName>Cape St. Ann</placeName> to the <placeName>River Nunez</placeName> (an Extent of Sixty Leagues) the
                            Number is from 3,000 to 3,500 annually; of these, 3,000 are purchased by the <name>English</name>, The
                            <name>Europeans</name> pay for them entirely in the Manufactures of this Country and of the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>, and
                            in <ecda:commodity>Rum</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Tobacco</ecda:commodity>. The Residents pay for them to the Black Merchants partly in <ecda:commodity>Salt</ecda:commodity>, (an
                            Article which they will not permit the <name>Europeans</name> to import into their Country, and which they
                            make on the Sea Coast), and partly in the Manufactures we import. The Average Price of
                            Slaves is from 15l. to 18l. on the Invoice Price of the Goods. We buy none under the Size of
                            Three Feet Nine Inches; nor any that shew Signs of old Age, if we can avoid it, but that is not
                            always in our Power, as they sell them in Lots. The Bulk of our Cargo is from 15 to 40 Years
                            of Age; the Proportion of Males is about Two Thirds; Children of the Height of Three Feet
                            Nine Inches and Upwards, are sold from 5l. to 8l. or 9l. apiece, according to their Size and
                            Beauty.

                        <p>Some Part of these Slaves are Convicts, but the Greater Number are Captives made in War.
                            <persName>Mr. Newton</persName> has Reason to believe that a great many of them come many Hundred Miles from
                            the interior Part of the Country; has been told that some of them are kidnapped in their Passage
                            through the Woods. There are Slaves also in this Country whose Children are born Slaves.
                            The Slaves are very little employed in their own Country, but are generally kept till an Opportunity
                            offers of selling them.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Newton</persName> cannot exactly say, whether Wars are entered into for the Purpose of making
                            Slaves, but it is probably. The People are like <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Travellers, and tell such wonderful
                            Stories there is no depending on them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether he thought the Situation of Slaves in <placeName>Africa</placeName> preferable to that in our <placeName>West
                            India Islands</placeName>? replied; The Slaves in <placeName>Africa</placeName> are treated with great Contempt, but they have
                            not the hard Labour and ill Usage they meet with in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. They are but ill fed in
                            <placeName>Africa</placeName>; they have Bananas and other Plants, and sometimes Half a Pound of Rice a Day for
                            their Food.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether the Slaves shew a great Apprehension or Reluctance on being sold? replied;
                            They are often under great Apprehension at the Sign of the Sea; they imagine they are bought
                            to be eat. Of the Slaves purchased on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, the usual Proportion is about Two
                            Thirds Males.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Bulk of the Cargo is generally from Sixteen Years of Age to Thirty; the Standard for
                            Heigh is about Four Feet Six Inches and upwards. The Females and the Boys soon recover
                            their Spirits, the Men seldom do, they remain gloomy a great while; such of the Slaves as are
                            not purchased remain Slaves, and lead a Dog's Life, as <placeName>Mr. Newton</placeName> believes; he has heard that
                            some who have not been sold, have been knocked on the Head with the Paddles of the Boat that
                            brought them, and then thrown overboard.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Newton</persName> being asked whether the Condition of the Slaves that are not sold is worse than
                            that of the Slaves in our Islands? replied; he never was any Length of Time in our Islands;
                            but believes that the Situation of Slaves at home is bad; worse on Board the Ships; and worst
                            of all in our Islands. <persName>Mr. Newton</persName> was not in any of our Island above a Month at a Time, and
                            then generally slept on board of his Ship.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked how the Slaves are procured on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName>? replied, On
                            the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> the Country from <placeName>Cape Mount</placeName> to <placeName>Cape Palmas</placeName> is divided into small districts.
                            The old Men generally govern the Villages. As there is no Union or regular Government, they
                            are frequently in a State of Hostility with each other; and as they live in distinct Communities,
                            the Traveller is sometimes waylaid and seized and sold for a Slave; this is what is understood
                            by the Term Kidnapping.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether these little States make war on each other for the Purpose of making 
                            Slaves? he replied, they make War on many Occasions, and the Consequence of War is making 
                            Slaves; but he believes in general the Number of Slaves arises, as in other Parts of the Coast,
                            from Debts and Crimes, and some are brought from distant Parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether many People are kidnapped in the Manner he had mentioned, and whether
                            this Practice would prevail in the same Degree if they had not the Hopes of purchasing <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Commodities with Slaves? <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> replied, it does not exist in any considerable Degree, but
                            there are Instances of it. If they had not the Temptation of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Goods, a bad Man would
                            be tempted in some other Way.
                        </p>
                        <p>Before they ever saw <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Commodities, as the Value of an Article depends on the Estimation 
                            it hold in the Fancy of him that covets it, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> doubts not that the rude Manufactures
                            of the Country, such as their little Trinkets of <ecda:commodity>Gold</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>, &amp;c. were as much an Object
                            of Plunder, in the former Times, as the Acquisition of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Manufactures is at present. The
                            oldest Writers, <persName>Leo the African</persName> and others, have represented the <name>Africans</name> as living in a State of
                            Rapine before the Commerce with <name>Europeans</name> was introduced amongst them.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Two Districts on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName>, from <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> to <placeName>Cape Mount</placeName>, and from thence
                            to <placeName>Cape Palmas</placeName>, about 5,000 Slaves are sold annually, many of whom come from the interior
                            Parts of the Country, but how made Slaves <placeName>Mr. Norris</placeName> cannot tell. They speak different Languages,
                            and do not understand each other. <placeName>Mr. Norris</placeName> could not collect Information much to be depended
                            on, how they became Slaves, but has sometimes met with Persons who had been Men of some
                            Consideration in their Own Country. The general Account was, that they had been condemned for
                            Intrigues with Women; that they had been sold for the Crime of Adultery. They would readily
                            confess having been guilty of that, and wish to conceal other Delinquencies, which in many Instances
                            were the Occasion of their being sold. They seem to have a great Horror at falling into the Hands
                            of the <name>Europeans</name>, which, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> presumes, is impressed on their Minds to deter them from the
                            Commission of those Crimes which, being injurious to Society, are punished with Condemnation to
                            Slavery, and if that Expedient did not offer would be punished with Death.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether there are any Native Slaves in that Part of the Country?
                            replied, He could not say, from his own Knowledge, that there are. This is a Part of the Coast,
                            where the Whites seldom go on Shore. The Inhabitants appear to live in a State of great Poverty.
                            The small Communities into which they are divided, have but little social Intercourse or
                            Connection with each other; and their natural Distrusts and Jealousies occasion frequent Quarrels
                            among them.

                        <p>The Slaves taken on board from this Part of the Coast, were purchased of the Black Traders.
                            With respect to the Manner in which they were made Slaves, <persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> was told in
                            one Instance, by <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a Slave to whom he had taught <name>English</name></ecda:anonPers>, that he had been invited to Supper,
                            and when going away, was seized by a Dog, and taken and sold. The Man said this was a common
                            Practice.

                        <p><persName>Captain Thomas Deane</persName> commanded a <ecda:commodity>Wood</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity> Vessel in the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade,
                            for the Three last Years, in which Time he has made Two Voyages, and traded principally on the
                            <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName>, from the <placeName>Isles de Los</placeName> to <placeName>Cape Le Hou</placeName>. He did not trade on his own Account,
                            but was in the Employ, as Captain of a Vessel, of <persName>Mr. Bigges</persName>, a Merchant of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. Continued
                            on the Coast Seven Months on his First Voyage, viz. From October to March; and Elven
                            Months in the Second Voyage, viz. from October to September.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Deane</persName> being asked, Whether he could inform the Committee in what manner the
                            Slaves purchased on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> are made so? replied, In various Methods. In the First
                            Place, for Crimes, or supposed Crimes: First, Witchcraft; for which great Numbers are tried
                            and sold; and he believes this is often made a Pretence in order to get Slaves to sell. They are
                            likewise sold for Adultery; and the Women will often entice the Men to commit Adultery, in
                            order to accuse them afterwards. Some become Slaves by having been taken Prisoners in War; some
                            are made so by Force, and by private Acts of Violence; and some are kidnapped. Being asked,
                            Whether any Cases of this Sort had come within his own Knowledge? he replied, He had not 
                            seen any; but on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> had heard of many by Report. <persName>Captain Deane</persName> knew of one
                            Canoe that went out to catch Slaves, and returned with Two; the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="canoeman">Head man of the Canoe</ecda:anonPers> was
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            killed in the Fray. Being asked, If he knew of any other Instance of Slaves made so by Violence?
                            replied, He did not. He knew of public Wars, but no other Instance of private Violence.
                            Being asked, Whether the Government of those Countries authorized or connived at Transactions
                            of this Sort? <persName>Captain Deane</persName> replied, They do not publicly; whether or not privately he cannot
                            say: The Plunderers would be sold themselves, if discovered. Being asked, Whether the Natives 
                            of those Countries go armed, in order to prevent such Outrages? he said, They generally are
                            armed, those who can afford to purchase them with Muskets; the others with Side-arms. This
                            they do to defend themselves from Wild Beasts, which are very numerous on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName>
                            (of which only <persName>Captain Deane</persName> speaks), and it may be also to protect themselves from their 
                            Countrymen; but of this <persName>Captain Deane</persName> is not sure. Being asked, Whether there are not a great Number of
                            Slaves brought down from the Back Country to be sold? he replied, There was  a great Number;
                            and added, they make the greater Proportion of those sold. Being asked, Whether the Prince of
                            the Country has not some Duty upon, or some Interest in, the Slaves that are publicly sold?
                            <persName>Captain Deane</persName> replied, He has an Emolument upon every Slave publicly sold, and generally
                            attends the Sales to receive his Duty; and for this Reason he has an Interest in preventing Slaves
                            being made so by Kidnapping and Violence. <persName>Captain Deane</persName>, however, is of Opinion, that notwithstanding
                            this, the Princes of the Country sometimes privately encourage those Acts of Violence.

                        <p>In the Fantyn Nation, a considerable Portion of the Community are Persons born Slaves. <!-- Fantyn name or placeName? -->
                            These have peculiar Privileges, and under them enjoy many Advantages which the Slaves of the
                            neighbouring Countries do not;—for Example, a Slave born in the Household cannot be sold at
                            the Caprice of his Master. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked whether there are any Slaves in that Country
                            arising from Delinquency, and whether there are any bought out of other Countries? replied,
                            There are a few <name>Ashantees</name>, and others, domesticated in their Families. The <placeName>Fantyn Country</placeName> also
                            furnishes annually about 2,000 Slaves, who become so for Delinquencies and Debt.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked whether the Privileges stated by him to belong to the born Slaves in
                            the <placeName>Fantyn Country</placeName>, extended to the Slaves purchased or acquired? replied, The Distinction is
                            this; a Slave that has been purchased or acquired may be disposed of at Pleasure; but a Slave born
                            within the Walls cannot be sold at the Will of his Master, unless guilty of Crimes, in which Case
                            he may be sold.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> does not conceive that Crimes are often falsely imputed to them in order to make
                            them Slaves; in some Cases it may happen, but not frequently. Accusations may sometimes proceed
                            from Avarice or Resentment, but the Decision is always before a Magistrate. In Cases of
                            Adultery the Fine is always to the Advantage of the Husband; and if the Fine, which is fixed at
                            the Price of a man Slave, is not paid, the guilty Person is sold.

                        <p>The <name>British</name>, <name>Dutch</name>, and <name>Danes</name> are the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Nations who, in Consequence of having Forts
                            there, posses the Trade of the Gold Coast. The <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> purchase about 6,000 Slaves there
                            annually, perhaps some Years a few more. As <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName> is the great Mart of Trade, the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs>
                            Ships anchor in that Road, and send their Boads to the different Forts from <placeName>Appollonia</placeName> to <placeName>Pram-
                            pram</placeName> inclusive. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot enter with Precision into a Detail of the particular Forts so as
                            to specify the Trade of each, but referred himself to <persName>Governor Miles</persName>, who has resided long there,
                            and might perhaps be able to give the Information required on that Head.

                        <p>The <name>Dutch</name> procure about 2,500 Slaves annually on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, chiefly at <placeName>Elmina</placeName> and
                            <placeName>Accra</placeName>; the <rs type="properAdjective">Danish</rs> Ships usually lie at <placeName>Accra</placeName>, and carry off about 1,500 Slaves annually, which
                            are procured chiefly there, the Remainder at <placeName>Ningo</placeName> and their Settlements near the <placeName>River Volta</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs>, <rs type="properAdjective">Portuguese</rs>, and <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> Vessels sometimes visit this Part of the Coast; but having
                            to Settlements there, enjoy but a little of its Trade; but should the <name>French</name> accomplish their
                            Intention of establishing themselves in the Vicinity of <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName>, they may expect an equal Share
                            of this Trade with the <name>British</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Merchants purchase these Slaves of the Black Traders, all resident upon the Coast,
                            who come by them in several Ways. The Black Traders go to certain Marts or Fairs, where they 
                            meet other Traders, and purchase Slaves of them. In what Manner the Black Traders, who
                            bring the Slaves to the Frontiers, come by them, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> does not know. Being asked,
                            whether from Conversation or other Means he had reason to suppose that many of these Slaves
                            were Captives made in War? he replied, He does not think this applies to the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, but
                            in other less civilized Parts of the Country he has no doubt Outrages may be committed for
                            the Purpose of making Slaves. The Object of making Slaves as One Sort of Plunder, may be
                            a concurrent Cause of War; but they have the same Motives for War as the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> nations,
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            such as Ambition, Avarice, Resentment, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Inhabitants of the interior Parts are less
                            civilized; and among them there may be predatory Wars; but it is not so with the <name>Ashantees</name> or 
                            the <name>Fantees</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Countries <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> has been describing, he by no Means thinks there are People who
                            employ themselves in Kidnapping for the Purpose of making Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked in what manner the Slaves purchased are paid for? he gave the following
                            Account:
                        </p>
                        <p>At <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, the Slaves are partly paid for in Cowries, and partly in Goods; on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>,
                            partly in Gold Dust, and the Remainder in Goods. Nine Tenths of the Gold Dust we receive for
                            Goods is paid back again for Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked what Proportion of the Price paid for Slaves is paid in Gold Dust, and what in
                            Goods? he said, About One Sixth Part is paid in Gold Dust, and the rest in Goods. At <placeName>Whydah</placeName>
                            One fourth in Shells or Cowries, and the Rest in Goods. Our Goods are carried up the Country
                            to pay for the Slaves. The Gold Dust, which is not produced on the Spot, comes from the
                            Ashantee Country, which is Five Days Journey at least, perhaps Ten. There is a greater
                            Demand for Gold at Annamaboe than the Country produces. The Quantity of Gold has diminished
                            from the Practice of burying it with the Dead, and from the additional personal Ornaments which
                            the Progress of Civilization has introduced among the Inhabitants.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked what is the Proportion of Slaves which the different Nations of <placeName>Europe</placeName>
                            annually export from the several Parts of the Coast? replied, the Whole of the very extensive
                            Coast of Negro Land supplies the following Numbers yearly.

                            Negroes annually from <placeName>Loango St. Paul's</placeName>; and it is a Fact that they have interrupted

                        <p><persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> being asked what are the different Modes, according to the best Information
                            he had been able to procure, in which Slaves are made in the Countries with which he was
                            acquainted? replied, In <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> and <placeName>Eyo</placeName>, they are Delinquents, Prisoners made in War, and
                            People sold at the Will of the Prince.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <placeName>Mahee</placeName> Country, some become Slaves from Delinquency, but he believes a great Number
                            from being kidnapped.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether the Government permits the latter? said, He believes the Country is not
                            well enough governed to prevent it.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <placeName>Fantyn Country</placeName>, Slaves become so for Debt and Delinquency. The Crimes for which
                            they are most frequently punished in this Manner are Theft, Adultery, and Witchcraft. <persName>Mr.
                            Devaynes</persName> has known an Instance of a Man Gaming himself away in that Country, and has Heard
                            that it now and then happens, but not often. Few are kidnapped; Kidnapping prevails in a
                            Degree in all those Countries in Proportion to the good and bad Government respectively. In
                            well governed Countries very little, in others more. During the Time he was in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, there
                            were very few Robberies or Murders in the Kingdom of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>, so well was it governed. In
                            the interior Parts there is hardly a Lock on the Doors, and yet Property is safe.
                        </p>
                        <p>The greater Part of the Slaves sold in the Countries he speaks of, are brought from the interior
                            Countries; they are sold from Hand to Hand, and many of them come from a great Distance;
                            <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> supposes from 800 to 900 Miles. The Language of the Slaves is very various,
                            and many of them do not understand each other. <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> supposes that wars are
                            sometimes entered into in these Countries for the Purpose of making Slaves; but said, the
                            Sovereigns of <placeName>Africa</placeName> are influenced in making War by the same Motives that influence <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Sovereigns. In a War that happened while he was there between the Kings of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> and <placeName>Eyo</placeName>, and
                            which arose from a Dispute about a Tribute, 60,000 People lost their Lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Age at which Slaves are usually sold to <name>Europeans</name>, is from Twelve to Thirty.</p>
                        <p>In those Parts of the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, where the Government is limited, there are domestic, or born
                            Slaves; the Children of Slaves are born Slaves, and follow the Condition of the Mother. <persName>Mr.
                            Devaynes</persName> does not know that the Masters of these born Slaves are restrained from selling them
                            among themselves, or to <name>Europeans</name>. The Labour of these domestic Slaves is not very
                            heavy, and they perform it chearfully enough. They are kindly treated, and sufficiently
                            maintained, sometimes by their Masters, and sometimes by their own Labour on Lands assigned
                            them for that Purpose; they are married, and have One or more Wives, and the Children are
                            Slaves if the Mother is so.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> is not sufficiently acquainted with the Country to say whether the Number of 
                            these slaves encreases by Birth.

                        <byline><persName>Mr. Miles</persName>.</byline>
                        <p>The Number of Slaves annually exported by the <name>English</name>, is from 7,000 to 8,000. The <name>Dutch</name>
                            and <name>Danes</name> export some, but he cannot say the Number. Each of these Nations have Forts on the
                            <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>. The <name>French</name> had formerly no Fort there, but are now erecting one. Their Trade has
                            hitherto been inconsiderable, and they have had no Intercourse with the Natives, but through
                            Interlopers. Lately indeed, since the French Government have given such extraordinary Bounties on
                            the Equipment of their <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Ships, as well as on the Importation of the Slaves into their <placeName>West India
                            Colonies</placeName>, the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Merchants have been induced to give the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Trader a very high Price
                            for Slaves on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>; but these they receive from the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Shipping, and not from the
                            Native Trader. The <name>English</name>, <name>Dutch</name>, and <name>Danes</name> have claimed an exclusive Right to the Trade
                            on this Part of the Coast; and <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> has know instances of the King's Ships driving <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs>
                            Vessels from it; particularly one, when <persName>Captain Cotton</persName> of the <ecda:shipName>Pallas</ecda:shipName>, at his Request, in the Year
                            <date when="1777">1777</date>, obliged a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Trader to quit the Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Miles</persName> being asked, Whether the Slaves on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> are not the most valuable? replied,
                            The Slaves on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> are the most robust and healthy. Of the Number abovementioned,
                            which this Part of the Coast affords, One Fourth, or nearly that Proportion, are <name>Fantees</name>
                            (either so born or naturalized), who beyond a Doubt become Slaves, and are sold for Debts
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            and Crimes of different Descriptions. <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> could speak the Language of the <name>Fantees</name>, and
                            therefore could in general ascertain for what they were sold. The Chief of these Crimes are Debt,
                            Theft, Adultery, and Witchcraft. The other Three Fourths of the Slaves are brought from the
                            interior Parts of the Country to the Borders of <placeName>Fantee</placeName>, or other Nations near the Water-side;
                            there they are sold to the Black Brokers, who sell them to the <name>Europeans</name>. He never could learn
                            from the Brokers how these Slaves became so, as they pass from the Interior of <placeName>Africa</placeName> from
                            Hand to Hand, by a Succession of Markets. It is however very natural to suppose, and <persName>Mr.
                            Miles</persName> thinks it equally fair to infer, from the Account he has just given of the <name>Fantees</name>, that a
                            considerable Proportion of these Slaves, brought down from the interior Parts, have in like Manner
                            forfeited their Liberty to the Laws of the Country they came from. The Language of these
                            Slaves differs so much, that a Lot of Slaves purchased one Day, will not understand the Language
                            of a Lot purchased the next, which proves, that the Countries  they are brought from are at a
                            considerable Distance from each other. They probably come from a great Distance inland, as
                            they have generally Sores from travelling through the Woods, by Paths which admit but one
                            at a Time, and are much emaciated. The Men are brought down with a Sort of Log on their
                            Arms; the Women and Children are at Liberty.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Miles</persName> does not know that any of the Slaves Purchased on this Part of the Coast become so
                            by being made Prisoners of War. It is possible some of the Slaves from the interior Parts may be
                            of this Description; but as to what relates to the People near the Water-side, if there are any
                            Skirmishes between the Villages, they are generally soon made up by the Interference of a Third, and
                            the Prisoners in such Case are always returned. The Fantee Nation was in perfect Peace during <!-- fantee nation as place or group? or rs? -->
                            Sixteen or Seventeen Years of <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> Residence there. He never heard of any Slaves being
                            kidnapped, either by our People or by each other. The Police observed among the Petty States
                            on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, is as regular and exact, or more so, than in any <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Nation. Every 
                            Traveller is obliged, on passing through a Village, to give an Account of himself and the Persons with
                            him, to the Magistrate or Sovereign. This invariable Custom, and the Practice of Kidnapping
                            cannot therefore exist. What he has said of the manner of making Slaves does not relate to
                            <placeName>Appollonia</placeName>, where the King is despotic, and Master of the Lives of his Subjects, whom, <persName>Mr. Miles</persName>
                            believes, he either puts to death or sells, at his Caprice directs. When he sells them he has the
                            Profit; and he presumes he may sell them at his Pleasure. <persName>Mr. Miles</persName>. was personally acquainted
                            with the late <persName>King of <placeName>Appollonia</placeName></persName>, and has more than once purchased Slaves of him, merely to save
                            their Lives. This King was a great Warrior, but he apprehends his Rights and his Power are the
                            same. At <placeName>Appollonia</placeName> there is a Sort of Council called Pynims, or Elders, which is occasionally
                            consulted by the King, but which is obliged to coincide with his Wishes.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are some born Slaves in this Country, but not in great Numbers; these are employed in
                            Cultivation of different Sorts, and Household Offices. Each Possessor of Slaves may, during his
                            Life, sell those he purchases, but those which belong to him by Succession cannot dispose of but
                            for Crimes, and after Trial by the Rest of the Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Miles</persName> being asked, What becomes of the Slaves that the Black Traders bring down to the
                            Coast, and which the <name>Europeans</name> do not purchase? replied, he had before observed, that we see
                            but few human Sacrifices; the Natives know we disapprove of them; but <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> has no
                            Doubt many of the refuse slaves are reserved for this Purpose. He has reason to believe this from
                            Observations he has bade, and Conversations he has sometimes overheard. When a Slave has been
                            refused, the Blacks have said in his Hearing, <said rend="quotes">If we can't sell him, such a Man is going to be buried,
                            and he will do for that.</said> In One Instance <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> remembers, upon the Death of a Chief, that
                            a great many Slaves were sacrificed; he used all the Influence he had acquired with the Natives
                            to prevent it; but his successor told <persName>Mr. Miles</persName>, that was impossible; but that he Ceremony
                            should be performed out of his Sight. He however saw several Bodies, and took care to have
                            them buried. On Occasion of the Funerals of great Men, the neighbouring Chiefs, among other
                            Presents, send a Slave or Two in Proportion to their Abilities, and the Rank of the Deceased, for
                            this Purpose. <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> has now and then, but rarely met with an Instance of a Slave shewing
                            Signs of Terror on being sold. Nine out of Ten rejoice at falling into our Hands. They seem
                            to be aware that they are bought for Labour, and by their Gestures wish to convince the Purchasers
                            that they are fit for it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves are purchased with almost ever Article of <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Manufacture; with <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity>,
                            <ecda:commodity>Rum</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Powder</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Arms</ecda:commodity>, <rs type="properAdjective">Manchester</rs> Goods, &amp;c. &amp;c. which Goods are carried to the next Market,
                            and so on into the interior Country from Market to Market.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Miles</persName> being asked, whether they are not Slaves belonging to the Company's Forts, and in 
                            what manner they are employed? replied, The Company have about 400 Slaves, of which there
                            are Ten or a Dozen at each of the Out Forts, and the Rest at <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName>. They consist of
                            Bricklayers, Carpenters, and Other Artificers. They work for the Benefit of the Company, and
                            to keep the Forts in Repair. We are obliged to be very strict with them; and <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> is
                            persuaded they would not work but from Compulsion. They are however very useful to us on Occasions <!-- possibly missing page??? -->

                        <p><persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> was on Shore constantly during the whole Time he was at <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName>,
                            which was Seven Months; and when he commanded the annual Ship, was frequently on Shore at
                            the Forts, as his Duty required.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being deried to give the Committee any Information he had to offer, respecting the Manner in
                            which the Slaves purchased on the Gold Coast, became so? he gave the following Account:—There
                            are very few Wars on the Gold Coast, though they are frequent to the Northward, and in the <persName>King of
                            <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>'s</persName> Country. The Slaves upon the Gold Coast are made so in consequence of their Crimes.
                            Adultery is the Crime for which they are most usually sold. In this Case, the Person offended has
                            a Claim, not only to the Man and Woman offending, but to all their Property, all their Family and
                            Slaves. <persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> saw the Heads of Seven of the Wives of a Chief at <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName>, upon 
                            a Drum, which he had ordered to be cut off for Adultery. The Pynims or Elders likewise condemn
                            to be sold as Slaves, Persons accused of other Crimes, such as Theft, and other Injuries.

                        <p>Fathers pawn their Children, for they rely on the Descendants of the Female Branches of the
                            Family for Heirs, as in that Case they are sure of the Blood; and they have much less 
                            Consideration for their own Children.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> being asked, Whether he conceived that the <name>Europeans</name>, to whom Children
                            are so pawned, are guilty of Fraud and Abuses in this Respect, and sell them before the
                            Time for which they are pawned for a certain Number of Months, and were formerly kept during that
                            Time in what was called the Floating Factory, but now they are kept in the Forts.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> remembers a Story of Two Princes, who had been Pawned by their Parents,
                            and were supposed to have been kidnapped, and carried away by Force. They were called <persName>Prince
                            Frederick</persName> and <persName>Prince William</persName>, and the Admiral knows that they were regularly sold. They
                            were carried first to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, where they were taken from the Merchants who brought them there,
                            by <persName>Governor Trelawney</persName>, upon a Supposition that they had been kidnapped: They were then 
                            brought to <placeName>England</placeName> as oppressed Princes, and were Treated with great Distinction. They returned
                            afterwards to their own Country, where they had an Allowance from the Factories of £80 per
                            Annum, which war for the Advantage of their respective Fathers, who were principal Men upon
                            the Coast, and sold for Slaves themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> does not think that many of the Slaves sold on the Gold Coast are brought
                            from the interior Parts of the Country: The <name>Fantees</name> prevent their coming, and will not, as they
                            term it, open the Paths, as they have an Horror of the Sea.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the manner in which Slaves are made on other Parts of the Coast,
                            <persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> cannot give any Account, not being so well acquainted with other Parts
                            of the Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Admiral Edwards</persName> being asked, Whether he could for any Judgment what would become of
                            these Slaves, if the <name>Europeans</name> did not purchase them? replied, He hardly knew what Opinion to
                            give, but he verily believes many of them would be destroyed. A Boy was once offered to be sold
                            in his Ship, and on being refused, the Person who had him to sell, dashed him with the greatest
                            Violence into the Canoe.—Being asked, Whether, if this Country were to relinquish the Trade in
                            Slaves, the Number sold to <name>Europeans</name>, would, in his Opinion be much diminished? replied,
                            Most certainly it would not be diminished: The <name>French</name> and <name>Dutch</name> would immediately get 
                            Possession of this Trade. He does not believe that the Natives of <placeName>Africa</placeName> would be much pleased with
                            such a Resolution, as they would be equally Slaves in their own Country; and when once they
                            have quitted it, they do not shew any Desire to return it.

                            went out first as Surgeon, and after a few Voyages became Master of a Ship.

                            upon either of these Parts of the Coast, because his Business was confined to the Ship; and he
                            observed in the Course of his Evidence, that he could not speak precisely with respect to the

                        <p>With respect to the Manner in which the Slaves carried from these two Parts of the Coast become
                            so, <persName>Mr. Anderson</persName> says there are very few of them Prisoners of War, because when a War
                            exists in the Country, all Trade is put a stop to.
                        </p>
                        <p>From the Year <date from="1764" to="1766">1764 to 1766</date>, there was a War in that Country; by Reason of which, <persName>Mr. Anderson</persName>
                            knows that a <rs type="properAdjective">Bristol</rs> Ship, which went there to purchase Slaves, was out Two Years upon
                            her Voyage, because she could not purchase her Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Anderson</persName> being asked, whether, when a War is at an End, there is not a Glut of Slaves at
                            Market, in consequence of such War? replied, he believed not.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked if he knew what becomes of the Prisoners of War upon this Part of the Coast?
                            he replied, He has heard that they are often put to Death?
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, by what other Methods these People become Slaves? <persName>Mr. Anderson</persName> says, that for
                            all Crimes which they commit, the Punishment is to be sold for a Slave. He conceives this makes
                            a considerable Part of the Numbers of Slaves, but the largest Part are those bought in the Inland
                            Countries, at regular Markets, to which they are brought by those who have them as their Property.
                            They are born Slaves, and are inherited by their Owners from Father to Son.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Anderson</persName> being asked, whether he had any Reason to suppose that any of them are made 
                            Slaves by being kidnapped? replied, He believes very seldom.
                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking of the Proportion of Male and Female Slaves, and Children in general, taken on
                            board the Ships he belonged to; he said, the Proportion varied in almost every Voyage, because
                            it is not in the Power of the Captain to have an Option in his Purchase, as the Slaves do not come
                            in that Abundance to Market upon the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, and they must take them as they come.
                            The general Proportion is Two Thirds male, to One Third Females:—They take as few Children
                            as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Of whom the Slaves are purchased on this Part of the Coast? <persName>Mr. Anderson</persName> replied,
                            On the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> there are Trading Men who are stiled Gold Takers, and who bring
                            them off to the Ships.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, whether he purchased all the Slaves that were offered to him? <persName>Mr. Anderson</persName>
                            said, he rejected a great many for various Infirmities. These were taken on shore again, and he
                            believes were chiefly purchased by the <name>Dutch</name>, who buy Slaves of an inferior Quality; but he has
                            always observed, that those who were rejected seemed to be much disappointed at going on shore
                            again.

                            He was a master of a Ship when he was on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, which was in the Year <date when="1776">1776</date>, but

                            <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>? replied, He knew nothing of the Manner in which they were made Slaves in the
                            Country. Some of them have told him that they were made Slaves for Debts and Crimes, such 
                            as Adultery. And <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">a Boy</ecda:anonPers> whom he had, told him, he was taken by Surprise, while he was in a
                            Garden. <persName>Mr. Bowen</persName> has heard from the Traders on the Coast, that the <name>Caboceers</name> breed Slaves
                            for the Purpose of Trading, whom they sell occasionally, as they may be in Want of <name>European</name>
                            Commodities. He has seen the Slaves brought down into the Slave Yards, from whence they were
                            carried in Canoes on board the Ships, and there offered for Sale by the Black Traders.

                        <p>The Country of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> is populous, but not so much so as it was. <placeName>Whydah</placeName> also is not so 
                            populous as it was. Since these Countries have been governed by a warlike Prince, who does not
                            understand Trade, they are not resorted to so much as formerly.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> supposes that the Number of Slaves exported from the Dominions of the <persName>King of
                            <placeName>Dahomey</placeName></persName> amounts to 10,000 or 12,000 in a Year. Of these, the <name>English</name> may export from 700
                            to 800, the <name>Portuguese</name> about 3,000, and the <name>French</name> the Remainder. Being asked, whether the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Trade to these Parts is carried on by themselves, for their own Account, or by <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
                            Traders for them? <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> replied, By themselves, as far as he knows. They may carry it
                            on by Means of <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Factors at other Ports, but here, and at <placeName>Angola</placeName>, they are competent to
                            carry it on by themselves, and are gaining ground on us daily.
                        </p>
                        <p>Slaves are purchased on this Part of the Coast, of the Black Merchants, appointed to trade 
                            by the King, for nobody trades there but by his Permission. With respect to the Manner of
                            their becoming Slaves, <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> says, there are Slaves of every Sort, some of them born in the
                            Country. The King orders any body to be sold whom he or his Ministers think proper to be sent
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            out of the Country. Others are Prisoners of War; others becomes Slaves for their Crimes. The
                            procuring Slaves may sometimes be a Motive for making war; but <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> believes not commonly.
                            He has heard from Tradition, that Wars were as frequent before they had any Knowledge
                            of the <name>Europeans</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Part of the Prisoners made in War, if not sold, are incorporated among the Slaves belonging to
                            the King, and Part are put to Death. The Crimes for which they are condemned to be sold, are
                            principally Adultery (for which they condemn to be sold, sometimes the offending Party only, and
                            sometimes the whole Family), Theft, and Witchcraft, by Means of which latter, People are supposed
                            to be put to Death. In these Cases there is no Form of Trial that <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> knows of,
                            but every thing is done by the Command of the King. If a Theft is committed upon an <name>European</name>,
                            the Thief is punished with Death; for which Reason we seldom make Complaint of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some of the Slaves are brought from the interior Country, beyond the Kingdom of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>,
                            and from very distant Parts: There are Markets to which the Traders go. The Slaves are known
                            to be of different Countries by the Marks on their Bodies, and by the Difference of their Language. <!-- i really think we should set up anonPersonographies in the hyperdiv! This guy has a langKnown! There's so munch information to be captured about these people. -->
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> once bought <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a Slave</ecda:anonPers> who could talk and write <name>Arabick</name>; he called himself a
                            <name>Malaye</name>, but they did not understand his Language sufficiently to collect from what Country he
                            came, but understood that he had been passed from Hand to Hand from a distant Country.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> being asked, whether he had ever heard of Persons being made Slaves in those
                            Parts of the Country by kidnapping?—replied, if the Question related to White People, the
                            Thing is impossible. With respect to the Black, he knows of no such Thing, and in this Part of the
                            Country it must be detected: Every one that sells a Slave pays a Duty to the King, whose Officers
                            would soon detect any thing of this Sort, and the Man would be punished, possibly by being sold
                            for a Slave himself.

                        <p>From <placeName>Bonny</placeName> to <placeName>New Calabar</placeName> about 14,000 Slaves are exported annually; 3,000 are purchased
                            by the <name>French</name>, the Remainder by the <name>English</name>. No other Country trades there. Much the
                            greatest Part of the Slaves are of the interior Country, and a few of <placeName>Andomey</placeName>, and the <placeName>Creek</placeName> and
                            <placeName>Brasban</placeName> Country; and a very few indeed Natives of <placeName>Bonny</placeName> and <placeName>New Calabar</placeName>. The <name>Europeans</name>
                            are very little acquainted with the interior Part of the Country; but from the best Information <persName>Mr.
                            Penny</persName> has been able to procure from the Traders, and from the Slaves themselves, the greatest
                            part of the Slaves become so by Delinquency; the rest are Prisoners of War.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> believes that some of the Slaves are brought from Countries still more distant in the
                            interior Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. They sometimes find from the Slaves that they have travelled Two
                            Moons (or Months) before they arrived at the Sea Coast. They may travel at the Rate of From
                            Twenty to Twenty-five Miles a Day.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to Wars being made in these Countries for the Purpose of obtaining Slaves, <persName>Mr.
                            Penny</persName> does not in general believe they are. The States are small, independent, and numerous, and
                            the People of a vindictive Nature. There are traditional Accounts of Wars, and very bloody
                            ones, before the <name>Europeans</name> traded there. The Memory of <name>Africans</name> is wonderful. He could
                            mention the most surprising Instances of it. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not believe in general that many
                            Delinquencies are imputed for the Purpose of making Slaves. With respect to their being
                            kidnapped, he can say nothing as to this Part of the Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are domestic Slaves in <placeName>Bonny</placeName> and <placeName>New Calaber</placeName>, who are never sold by their Masters except
                            for Crimes, for which they are tried by the Twelve old Men mentioned in his Evidence
                            respecting the Government of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>At <placeName>Bonny</placeName> the Slaves are purchased of the King, who is the principal Trader, and of other
                            Traders; at <placeName>New Calabar</placeName>, of the before-mentioned Amachree, and of other Traders. These
                            Traders go up into the Country to purchase Slaves. They go up the Rivers to the Distance of
                            about Eighty Miles from <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, and the same from <placeName>New Calabar</placeName>, in large Canoes, with Two or
                            Three principal Persons, and about Forty Men in each. The Canoes go in a Body all together to
                            defend themselves if attacked. At the Head of these Two Rivers there is a Mart for Trade, where
                            the Black Traders purchase these Slaves of other Black Traders, who bring them from the interior
                            Country. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, if he had ever observed that these Slaves had Marks of any
                            fresh Wounds? replied, Not often; but he has sometimes observed such Marks.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves are purchased with the Manufactures of this Country, <rs type="properAdjective">India</rs> Goods, <ecda:commodity>Spirits</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Brass Pans</ecda:commodity>,
                            <ecda:commodity>Arms</ecda:commodity>, &amp;c. &amp;c. and with a Sort of Copper Wreath or Bandage, which are called Manilles, and are
                            considered as the Money of that Country. The People hoard them in great Quantities against 
                            Times of Distress. They always carry the Goods up the Country, and a few of the Manilles.

                        <byline><persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName>.</byline>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName>, in his First Voyage to <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, got 380 Slaves, in the last 420. The
                            Slaves taken on board at Bonny were procured of the Black Traders, who go up to Fairs in the
                            Country to purchase and bring them down to the Coast. They pass through several Hands and
                            come from a great Distance. They bring them in a miserable Condition from the Fairs, half
                            starved, and exposed to the Wet, in Boats, with hardly any Covering. He does not know whether
                            the Slave Traders pay for the Slaves they purchase, in Manufactures, or in Gold Dust; but we pay
                            for them in Manufactures and in Gold Dust. We purchase the Gold Dust first in order to pay for the
                            Slaves therewith. <persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> believes that none of the Slaves they had on board were
                            Inhabitants of the Coast. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-status="enslaved">A Woman, big with Child</ecda:anonPers>, told him, that she was caught as she was
                            returning from a Neighbour's House, and passed through many hands before she came to them.
                            And <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">an old Man</ecda:anonPers> and <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">his Son</ecda:anonPers> told him, that they were kidnapped as they were planting Yams.
                            <persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> saw himself a Man who was invited to come and look at the Ship, and was
                            seized, brought on board and sold. Being asked, whether in addition to what he had before
                            said, he had any other Facts to prove that Kidnapping was a common Practice? He replied, On
                            the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> they are afraid of stirring out at Night; and <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a slave in <placeName>Grenada</placeName></ecda:anonPers> said to
                            <ecda:anonPers>another Person</ecda:anonPers>, in the Hearing of <persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName>, that he had been employed in kidnapping
                            others, and was afterwards kidnapped himself. <persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> has often seen Slaves go
                            mad.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked how he accounted in his own Mind for the Number of People he imagines to have
                            been kidnapped, and whether this Practice could possibly go to such Extent as he states in his
                            Pamphlet, wherein he says, that Slaves are sometimes brought down to the Amount of Fifteen
                            hundred together? He replied, it was his Opinion, from several Circumstances, that this Practice
                            prevails.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves brought down from the interior Parts of the Country speak different Languages.
                            They had <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-status="enslaved">one Woman</ecda:anonPers> whom none of the other Slaves could understand. There is much Difference
                            in the Appearance of these Slaves; they have different Marks, and some are much blacker 
                            than others. The <rs type="properAdjective">Ebo</rs> Negroes have their Teeth filed like a Saw.
                        </p>
                        <p>It often happens that the Slaves offered for Sale are refused. <persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> cannot say what
                            they do with such as are refused; but he has seen them cruelly beaten. He made particular Enquiry
                            whether the People breed Slaves for Sale, and could not find the least Reason to believe it.
                            In the Enquiries he made, he never received any other Account than what he has given of the
                            Mode in which Slaves are made, and never heard of any Wars made for that Purpose.

                            and a few Alterations were made in it upon Questions put to this

                        <p><persName>Mr. James</persName> was Three Voyages to the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> for Slaves; the first in the <ecda:shipName>Juno</ecda:shipName>, Captain
                            <persName>Pinnell</persName>, in or about the Year <date when="1764">1764</date>; the second in the <ecda:shipName>King George</ecda:shipName>, <persName>Captain Knight</persName>, in or

                            All these were from the Port of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, and were either to <placeName>Bonny</placeName> or <placeName>Calabar</placeName>. Whatever <persName>Mr.
                            James</persName> can clearly recollect of the first Two Voyages he will mention, though he wishes to confine
                            himself to the last, from which he returned as Third Mate to <placeName>Lucie Harbour in Jamaica</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 1. Some of the Slaves sold to the <name>Europeans</name> are such as are termed Prisoners of War.
                            When the <ecda:shipName>Juno</ecda:shipName> was lying, in the Year <date when="1764">1764</date>, in <placeName>Bonny River</placeName>, several of the large War Canoes
                            came from the inland Country with Captives. Some Heads, which had been cut off from the
                            slain, were stuck upon Poles as Trophies. They came in Triumph by the Side of the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
                            Vessels, and afterwards landed their Prisoners, to prepare them for Sale. Whether the People
                            that returned with Slaves had gone out for the sake of revenging an Injury, or on purpose
                            to rob, <persName>Mr. James</persName> is not able to say; he has heard from the Negroes, that at Times the Way of
                            procuring Slaves by the poorer Traders at Bonny and Calabar, was to go into the inland Country,
                            and take of private Families by Surprise.
                        </p>
                        <p>That Fraud and Treachery constitute one of the Means of obtaining Slaves, is a Fact which
                            <persName>Mr. James</persName> can testify of his own Knowledge. The White Traders give the Kings, in whose
                            Territories they intend to slave, what is called a Dash, (i. e.) a Present, for Permission to break
                            Trade. The Black Traders, on the other Hand, pay for every Slave they ship on board, a certain
                            Tax. It so happened, while the <ecda:shipName>Britannia</ecda:shipName> was on the Coast, that <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="trader">a trading Man at <placeName>Calabar</placeName></ecda:anonPers>
                            had brought from the inland Country Two Slaves. These he wanted to sell, but was desirous
                            of avoiding, if possible, to pay the before-mentioned Duty to the King. Another Trader
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            who became acquainted with his Wishes, undertook to manage the Business for him. He desired
                            him to bring his Two Slaves down to the Water-side at Night, that he might get them
                            on board unseen, and to attend them himself to the Vessel, that he might receive their Value.
                            His Advice was embraced and followed; they were all conveyed to the <ecda:shipName>Britannia</ecda:shipName>, when the
                            Trader, who undertook to smuggle the Two Slaves on board, pulled off the Mask, and not only
                            sold them, but their Master also. These, and other Frauds of a similar nature, are constantly
                            practised to make Slaves; and <persName>Mr. James</persName> has heard from the <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> Captains, that the <name>Europeans</name>
                            make no Scruple to receive such as they know to have been trepanned in this Manner.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. James</persName> is the more confirmed in his Opinion, that Fraud and Surprise are the Foundation
                            of Slavery, because he has repeatedly conversed with the Negroes in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, who
                            have told him that they were taken away from their Country in this Manner. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-status="enslaved">One Girl</ecda:anonPers> in
                            particular, when he was in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the Year <date when="1778">1778</date> or <date when="1779">1779</date>, informed him, that she, and <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">her
                            Father</ecda:anonPers> and <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="female">Mother</ecda:anonPers>, had been thieved by the Inland Traders; and that her Father had been
                            sold on board a Ship different from that to which she and her Mother had been consigned.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 2. <persName>Mr James</persName> has heard from the Traders and Canoe Boys of <placeName>Bonny</placeName> and <placeName>Calabar</placeName>, that
                            some of the Slaves sold to the <name>Europeans</name> are such as have become so in consequence of Debt and
                            others in consequence of Crimes. The great Bulk of them, however, by the Confession of the
                            same People, were such as had been taken in piratical Excursions, or by Treachery and Surprise;
                            and from what he knows of the Trade, he believes their Assertions to be true.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 3. Though <persName>Mr. James</persName> is not able of his own Knowledge to say that the Whites are
                            guilty of similar Depredations, yet he believes it to be true; for he has repeatedly heard the
                            Officers of <name>Guineamen</name> boast of having been exterous in performing such Exploits while running
                            down the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 4. The Black Traders of <placeName>Bonny</placeName> and <placeName>Calabar</placeName>, who are very expert at reconing and talking
                            the different Languages of their own Country and those of the <name>Europeans</name>, come down about once
                            a Fortnight with Slaves; Thursday or Friday is generally their trading Day. Twenty or Thirty
                            Canoes, sometimes more and sometimes less, come down at a Time. in each Canoe may be
                            Canes, Grass Rope, or other Ligaments of the Country; and if they happen to be stronger than
                            common, they are pinioned above the knee also. In this Situation they are thrown into the
                            Bottom of the Canoe, where they lie in great Pain, and often almost covered with Water. On
                            their landing, they are taken to the Traders Houses, where they are oiled, fed, and made up for Sale.
                        </p>
                        <p>When they have been sufficiently prepared, the Captain and Doctor generally go together to
                            examine them, and to make their Purchases there. No sickly Slave is ever purchased; at least
                            in the Three Voyages which <persName>Mr. James</persName> made it was never done. When the Bargain is made
                            they are brought away. This is generally in the Close of the Evening. Forty or Fifty of them
                            are brought away at a Time; sometimes in the Canoes of the Traders, and at other Times in
                            the Ships Boats. They appear to be very dejected when brought on board. The Men are put
                            into Irons, in which Situation they remain during the whole of the Middle Passage, unless when
                            they are sick; but not the Boys and Women.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. James</persName> was asked the following Questions.</p>

                        <p>To the best of my Recollection, about Fourteen the first, Sixteen the second, and Eighteen
                            the third.
                        </p>
                        <p>Was you ever on shore on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>?</p>

                        <p><persName>Captain Hall</persName> purchased 280 Slaves in each Voyage, which were bought of the Black
                            Traders, Natives of the Country. He believes these Slaves to have been Captives made in War, and
                            some of them kidnapped, having heard this from some of the Slave Brokers who speak broken <name>English</name>,
                            but does not believe the Number of Slaves who had been kidnapped was near so many as
                            those taken in War. The Kings and their Relations at each Place were the greatest Traders, but
                            there were a Number of others. Being asked, whether he imagined that these Slaves were Prisoners
                            of War made by the Kings, or People kidnapped by them? he replied, None of them were made
                            Prisoners by the Kings, or other Merchants. <persName>Captain Hall</persName> imagines they were procured by then
                            from other Traders who live higher up the Country, and were probably People of the same 
                            Description. <persName>Captain Hall</persName> supposes that he Food on which the Negroes live in their own Country
                            is Rice, Yams, and Poultry, and now and then a salted Tyger or Elephant.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Hall</persName> believes the <name>Africans</name> to be as capable of Attachments, and as virtuous in all
                            Respects as <name>Europeans</name>; and imputes their Despondency on being sold, to their being taken from
                            their Friends, Relations, and Country.
                        </p>

                        <p><persName>Captain Hall</persName> has seen Canoes, in which Sixty or Seventy Persons were paddling, come down the
                            River with Thirty or Forty Slaves, who were generally with their Hands tied behind them, and
                            some of them in Irons. Captain Hall believes that none of the Slaves he bought were People of
                            the Coast. And being asked, What Age the Slaves were who were offered to him? replied, From
                            Children up to Thirty. Sometimes they offered an old Man or Woman; but they were so invariably
                            rejected, that they seldom brought them.

                                        including the Captain, Men, and Boys, amounted to Nineteen. On the <date when="1787-09-25">25th of September</date>
                                        following we arrived at the Island of Bimbe, the Place of our Destination. This Island, which is
                                        a very small one, is situated opposite to that Part of the Continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName> which is 
                                        distinguished by the Name of the High Lands of the <name>Cameroons</name>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The first Person who was purchased at this Island for the Ship was <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-status="enslaved">a young girl of about <!-- i feel as though we should give this anonPers, since "Eve" is functioning more like a title -->
                                        Fifteen Years of Age</ecda:anonPers>, whom we called <persName>Eve</persName>; for it is usual on board the Slave Ships to give the                               <!-- he later says that the first woman and man purchased were called "Adam" and "Eve" so this is obviously not her actual name, although she is *named* -->

                                        who was extremely clever and intelligent, told <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> the following Tale: <said rend="quotes">That a Goat had
                                        been found in <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">her Father's</ecda:anonPers> Garden, which she said, had been purposely put there: That one
                                        of the Traders and great Men of the Place came in the Morning, and finding the Goat there,
                                        charged her Father with having stolen it, and said, moreover, that nothing less would satisfy him
                                        for the Offence than One of his Daughters as a Slave. In consequence of this, he was obliged
                                        to produce them, or abide by the Consequences himself. They were Three in Number, and
                                        the great man, liking her the best whom we called Eve, took her and sold her to those Traders,
                                        who afterwards brought her to the Vessel.</said> She came from a Place called <placeName>Bunje</placeName>, which is
                                        on the opposite Continent of the <name>Cameroons</name>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>About Three Months afterwards, <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-status="enslaved">a young Girl of about Eight Years</ecda:anonPers> old was brought on
                                        board. On being placed on the Quarter-deck, she either saw, or attracted the Notice of the other
                                        young Girl just mentioned. They very soon embraced each other, and went below. Their Features
                                        were much alike, and it appeared, upon Inquiry, that they were Sisters. <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> had
                                        never the Curiosity to inquire how she came into the Situation of a Slave.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>It repeatedly happens, that Relations are brought on board, such as Brothers and Sisters, Wives
                                        and Husbands, and these at separate Times. The Scenes exhibited between them are often
                                        very affecting.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>To proceed with this Narrative: About Three Weeks after the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> had arrived at <placeName>Bimbe</placeName>, a
                                        black Trader brought another on board. They drank together, and were sociable in the Vessel;
                                        when, on a Signal being given by the Captain to some of the Ship's Company, the Person
                                        brought on board was immediately seized and put in Irons. He was afterwards carried to the
                                        <placeName>West Indies</placeName>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In this Manner Five others were taken. They were brought to the Vessel at Five Separate
                                        Times by the Traders. They were conducted to the Cabin, where they refreshed themselves and
                                        appeared merry, but on their coming out, were seized by the Sailors, who had received Orders from the
                                        Captain for that Purpose. For <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> had heard the Captain say, in all these Instances, to the
                                        Sailors, <said rend="quotes">Mind, such an one is intended for us; stand by and seize him;</said> or Words to that
                                        Meaning.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><ecda:persGroup a-gender="mixed" a-status="enslaved">Three Males and One Female</ecda:persGroup> were also on board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>, who were said to have been sold
                                        for Debt. One of these was a Trader: he had borrowed a Gun of another Trader to complete
                                        his Assortment; he was unable, however, to return it on Demand: In consequence of this,
                                        he was seized and sold. The History of this Man <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> learned from the Person who
                                        brought him on board the Vessel.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>There were also among the Slaves, as far as <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> could learn from his Inquiry, some who had
                                        been sold for Adultery; One of these confessed that he had been guilty, but others that they were
                                        innocent, this Crime having been purposely laid to their Charge that they might be taken and sold.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>On board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> were also <ecda:persGroup>Five or Six who had received Wounds</ecda:persGroup>, which wounds had
                                        been seemingly made either by a Cutlass or a Knife; for they appeared, except One, to be clean
                                        cut. One Man had a Wound on his right Ancle, and another had a Wound on one Side of the
                                        Head: the Fore-finger of a Third was nearly cut off. These Wounds, which Wounds had
                                        been seemingly made either by a Cutlass or a Knife; for they appeared, except One, to be clean
                                        cut. One Man had a Wound on his right Ancle, and another had a Wound on one Side of the
                                        Head: The Fore-finger of a Third was nearly cut off. These Wounds must have been given
                                        them while the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> lay at Bimbe; for they came under <persName>Mr. Arnold's</persName> Care, and did not appear
                                        to have been more than of a Week's Date.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> did not inquire of these how they became Slaves, but set them down in his own
                                        Mind as having been taken either by Stratagem or Force; that they had been resisting the Efforts
                                        of their Captors, and that during their Resistance they had met with the above Wounds.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> was the more confirmed in this Opinion, because there were several Boys on board
                                        from the Age of Seven to Twelve. who had no Relations on board. These Boys could never 
                                        have come to the Ship either for Adultery or Debt; but must, <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> thinks, have been stolen
                                        or taken by Fraud or by Force; which Custom he believes to be much in force.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>If there is any other Circumstance to strengthen his Opinion more, it is, that he has heard
                                        <persName>Captain Williams</persName> often say, who had been long in the Slave Trade, that People watch in
                                        the long Grass at <placeName>Angola</placeName>, and make Slaves of all those who chance to be passing that Way.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>By these Means, viz. by means of Charges (either feigned or real) of Adultery or Debt, by
                                        enticing People on board and detaining them forcibly, and by means of Treachery of other
                                        Kings (as <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> verily believes), many of these Slaves who were on board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>
                                        were obtained.

                                        attended Fairs that were held at <placeName>Bunje</placeName>; and it is worthy of Remark that more were universally
                                        brought down at the full Moon than at any other Time.

                                    <p>When the Traders had bargained for their Slaves on the Continent, they led or drove then
                                        down to their Canoes. This was done in the following Manner: The Arms of some of the
                                        Slaves were tied behind them, and made fast with a Kind of Ivy, which is used there as a Rope;
                                        round their Necks was a Collar made of Roots or Twigs, and to this was fastened a Pole of about
                                        Three Inches in Diameter, and Three Yards long, of the Following Form:

                                        <figDesc>Depicting the collar and pole with which enslaved persons were carried on to the boat. Consists of a ring
                                            off to the left, and a long pole extending off to the right, with labels "A" "B" and "<hi rend="italic">c</hi>" 
                                            labelling the collar, connecting portion, and pole, respectively.

                                        along. This was the Situation of some, while others were secured in a different Manner. The
                                        Arms of those to whom <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> alludes were not tied behind their Backs, as in the former 
                                        Case, but were confined by means of a Board,

                                    <p>Confined in this Manner, they were placed in the Bottom of the Canoes; generally about Five
                                        in each, and conveyed to <placeName>Bimbe</placeName>. The Traders, having first prepared them there for Sale,
                                        brought them on board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>; many of them were in a shocking Situation, but particularly
                                        those whose Arms were tied behind them; for the twisted Ropes before mentioned had been
                                        drawn so tight across the Wrist and other Parts, that their Arms were much swelled, and the deep
                                        Marks occasioned by them were not erased for some Time.

                                        Continent, are not al of them Natives of those Parts; for <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-status="enslaved">a Female on board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName></ecda:anonPers> had
                                        come a considerable Way from the interior Country; no one on board could understand her
                                        Language. Having learnt a little <name>English</name> in the course of her Voyage, she gave them to understand 
                                        that she had been purchased for a few Beads: That in travelling down, she was sold to a
                                        Trader for some Beads and Manilloes; who conducting her still farther, sold her for Beads,
                                        Manilloes, and some Cloth. In this Way she travelled on, increasing her Value, and came at
                                        last to the Vessel; she was much frightened on the Firing of a Gun, and said that she had seen o
                                        such Instrument in her Country; she said also, that she had travelled Six Moons.

                                    <p>In the manner then before mentioned the Slaves were received on board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>. It was
                                        <persName>Mr. Arnold's</persName> Business to examine them before they were purchased for the Vessel. If a Man was 
                                        ruptured, or a Woman had a fallen Breast, they never bought them. If they did not exceed
                                        Four Feet, they were refused; much also depended on the Goodness of their Eyes and Teeth.
                                        <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> believes that they refused full as many as they bought.

                                    <p>It was usual in those Parts where the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> lay (<persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> observed), to trust such of the principal
                                        Traders as were People of Character with Goods from the Ship. Those to whom we were particularly
                                        known, were, <persName>King George</persName>, <persName>King Peter</persName>, and <persName>Quon</persName>, a very capital Trader, all from the
                                        <name>Cameroons</name>; <persName>King Mason</persName>, his Son <persName>Captain Dick</persName>, <persName>Peter</persName>, <persName>Bimbe Tom</persName>, <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, and <persName>Great and

                                    <p>But though, as observed before, we intrust the Traders with Goods with which they go to
                                        the Fairs, yet we expect that they should leave us something as a Pledge for their Return. To
                                        satisfy us in this Particular, they leave their Children and Relations in our Custody, whom we
                                        distinguish by the name of Pawns. As the Traders bring us Slaves, or, in other Words, as
                                        they pay their Debts, so these are released. But if they are unable to discharge them at an
                                        appointed Day (which day is fixed for the sailing of the Ship), they are taken to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>
                                        and sold.

                                    <p>The following is an Instance of what <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> has been now relating: While they were lying at
                                        the Island of <placeName>Bimbe</placeName><anchor xml:id="a08ish" corresp="#n08ish"/>, captain <persName>Bibby</persName> of the <ecda:shipName>Moly</ecda:shipName> of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, came out of the <placeName>River Cameroons</placeName>
                                        to the Cape of the same Name, having several Pawns on board belonging to Three of the Traders
                                        before Mentioned, viz. <persName>King George</persName>, <persName>King Peter</persName>, and <persName>Quon</persName>; <persName>Captain Bibby</persName> had given them
                                        notice that he should sail to the Cape, and that he would wait there Three Days before he went
                                        to Sea, and that if the Pawns were not redeemed by that Time, he should carry them to the
                                        <placeName>West Indies</placeName> and sell them there. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In consequence of this Declaration, the Three <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> Traders before mentioned came to
                                        the Island of <placeName>Bimbe</placeName>, and begged of <persName>Captain Williams</persName> of the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> to spare them some Slaves and
                                        Ivory, that they might redeem those Pawns which the before-mentioned <persName>Captain Bibby</persName> had
                                        threatened to take away.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><persName>Captain Williams</persName> did not wholly comply with their Request; however, he spared them Eleven
                                        Slaves and Five Teeth, which they immediately carried on board the <ecda:shipName>Molly</ecda:shipName>; in consequence of
                                        which, Six or Seven of their Pawns were released. All these were brought to the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>, and were
                                        there kept as Pawns for those Goods which <persName>Captain Williams</persName> had advanced to the Traders 
                                        before mentioned.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This happened on the <date when="1788-02-05">Fifth of February 1788</date>, and on the next Day the <ecda:shipName>Molly</ecda:shipName> sailed for the
                                        <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, having on board, by the best Information <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> could collect, about Thirty
                                        Pawns.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The Transaction of which <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> has now been speaking was attended with bad Consequences;
                                        for the Traders, when they found that <persName>Bibby</persName> had actually sailed, were so incensed, that they
                                        immediately left us, and returned to the <name>Cameroons</name>, with a Determination to seize and stop all the
                                        Captains of every Description, whether in the Ivory or Slave Trade, who might be there; Five of them
                                        (as <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> was afterwards repeatedly informed) were accordingly taken, carried into the Country to
                                        the different Towns of the Three Traders before mentioned, and chained down to Trees. In this
                                        Situation the Traders insisted upon it, that a Schooner should be dispatched after <persName>Bibby</persName> to bring 
                                        
                                        <pb/>
                                        
                                        back the Pawns, and that they should remain in Confinement till her Return. A Schooner was
                                        accordingly dispatched, with Slaves on board to give in Exchange for the said Pawns. In the
                                        Interim, however, before the Return of the said Schooner, the Officers of the different Vessels,
                                        aided by the Seamen, who were armed, went to release the above Captains from their Confinement.
                                        One Sailor was wounded and One Black Man was killed, and others wounded in the
                                        Scuffle. By these Means Four of the Captains were released, but the Fifth, named <persName>Bean</persName>, Captain of
                                        a large Ship belonging to <placeName>London</placeName>, being farther inland, could not be rescued, and he was still in
                                        Confinement when the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> left the Coast.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>By means then of these Pawns, which <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> has now sufficiently described, the Trade of
                                        <placeName>Bimbe</placeName> and the <placeName>Cameroons</placeName> is carried on. The Medium of Exchange at these Places is called a
                                        Bar; this Bar is worth about Four Shillings in our Money. A Gun is, generally speaking, sold
                                        to the Natives for Three Bars, and a prime Slave in these Parts does not, <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> believes,
                                        cost us more than Ten or Twelve Pounds per Head.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> added, he was sorry to be obliged to confess that the Slave Trade at <placeName>Bimbe</placeName> and the
                                        <placeName>Cameroons</placeName>, as far as his Observations went, was conducted on the Principle of Force.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Of this he gave some Instances which had fallen under his own Knowledge.</p>
                                    <p>A Day or Two before we arrived at <placeName>Bimbe</placeName>, he observes, the <ecda:shipName>Comet</ecda:shipName>, <persName>Captain Wilding</persName>, of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>,
                                        was lying there. It is to be observed that the Natives of <placeName>Bimbe</placeName> subsist principally upon Fish. It so 
                                        happened that they were employed in this Occupation at this Time; Captain Wilding, considering that
                                        the more there were employed in this Way, the less there would be to go for Slaves, and the longer
                                        he would be in completing his Cargo, determined to force them to be employed in the Slave Trade.
                                        He accordingly fired among them, while they were attending their Fish Pots in their Canoes, and
                                        endeavoured by these Means to strike Terror into them, as to make them leave their
                                        Employment. This <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> heard from <persName>Captain Wilding's</persName> own Mouth, when he visited on
                                        board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>: The <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> fired upon them also.

                                    <p><persName>Captain Williams</persName> was also equally well known for forcing Trade, and for forcing the Natives
                                        to trade upon his own Terms; <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> has seen different Black Traders come on board to
                                        dispose of their <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>, and has seen them repeatedly beaten by the Captain and put into Irons, 
                                        because they would not comply with his Terms in taking inferior Goods in Exchange for their
                                        Commodities. Of this he will give the following Instance, as it will shew the bad Effects which may
                                        result from such bad Proceedings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>On the Island of <placeName>Bimbe</placeName> the most considerable Trader, and a man of the greatest Consequence, was
                                        called <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>. One Morning he came on board with <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity> to trade. The Captain having 
                                        reserved his best guns for the Purchase of Slaves, offered him others of an inferior Sort: These he
                                        refused to take, saying, that he should never be able to dispose of them to the other Traders; upon
                                        this the Captain immediately seized him, and with some Assistance confined him. He put a Collar
                                        round his neck, to which was fastened a large Chain; the End of this Chain was put through Two
                                        ring Bolts on the Deck, and locked to the farthermost Bold with a Key, which Key was afterwards
                                        kept in the Captain's Cabin. The Captain however pretended, that he did not stop him for
                                        refusing the Guns, but for the Debts contracted by the Three <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> Traders before mentioned,
                                        whose Pawns he had released from <persName>Bibby</persName>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, astonished at this Treatment, asked him how he could possibly stop him for another
                                        Man's Debts; that he was not a <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> Man; that the <name>Cameroons</name> were not <name>Bimbe</name>, nor <name>Bimbe</name>
                                        the <name>Cameroons</name>; that if he had had any Share in the Transaction, or if he had ever passed his Word
                                        for the <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> Traders, the Case would have been quite altered, but that he had never done so,
                                        and that he had therefore been very unjustly seized and detained.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>At this Juncture, and while this Act of Violence was taking place, <persName>Bimbe Jack's</persName> Canoe was
                                        along-side of the Vessel, and <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="canoeboys">some of his Canoe-boys</ecda:persGroup> in it. <persName>Little Tim</persName>, however, a Black Trader
                                        who had come with them, was on board the Brig, and, seeing the Transaction, jumped immediately
                                        into the Cane, and pulled away for the Island. The Captain immediately upon this ordered the
                                        Two Top-sails to be bent, and went over the Bar with the Schooner <ecda:shipName>Saint Andrew</ecda:shipName>, <persName>Captain
                                        Martin</persName> (belonging to <persName>Mr. Teast</persName> of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, in the <ecda:commodity>Wood</ecda:commodity> and <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity> Trade); fearing lest his Vessel.
                                        in consequence of seizing and confining <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, who was a Man of the first Consequence in
                                        the Island, might be cut off.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> continued over the Bar for about Three or Four Days; when, on account of the
                                        very heavy Tornadoes, and Inclemency of the Weather, as well as Want of Water for the Middle
                                        Passage, she came in again with the Schooner <ecda:shipName>St. Andrew</ecda:shipName>, <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName> having been all this Time
                                        in Confinement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>When the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName> had crossed the Bar again, her Boat was sent for Water in company with the <ecda:shipName>St.
                                        Andrew's</ecda:shipName> Boat, and the Men were armed. They completed the <ecda:shipName>Ruby's</ecda:shipName> Water, but, during the
                                        Time of watering, several Canoes were seen hovering about from different Parts, which gave the
                                        Captain reason to suppose that they intended to take the Boats; but they were deterred at that Time
                                        on account of the Ship's Guns.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <pb/>
                                    
                                    <p>About Three days afterwards <persName>Captain Williams</persName>, having now completed his own Water, hailed
                                        <persName>Captain Martin</persName> to know if he had gotten Water enough for his own Vessel, and that if he had not
                                        completed it, he had better do it now, and that he would assist him. <persName>Captain Martin</persName> made
                                        a Reply, in consequence of which the <ecda:shipName>Ruby's</ecda:shipName> Boat with the Second Mate and Four Men well
                                        armed, was sent off, and was joined by that of the <ecda:shipName>St. Andrew</ecda:shipName>, whose People were armed in the
                                        same Manner. In consequence of the Mate and Four Seamen having gone off in the Boat (as
                                        now described), and Four others having died before, there were left on board the <ecda:shipName>Ruby</ecda:shipName>, 
                                        including the Captain, himself, Men and Boys, but Ten White Persons.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Such was the Situation of Affairs on board the Ruby, when the Natives made an Attempt
                                        to retaliate upon us for our Conduct to <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, the whole Process and Success of which
                                        will be found in the following Description:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A Trader from <placeName>Bimbe</placeName> came on board us, and demanded a Debt of Salt. One or Two
                                        People came with him into the Ship, but his Canoe-men remained in his Canoe, which was
                                        lying by the Bows of the Vessel. In a little Time the Chief Mate and some of the Crew
                                        were employed in measuring and keeping a Reckoning of the Salt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>While they were so employed, a second Canoe was discovered to be coming to the Ship with a
                                        Slave on board, and a third with Two; upon which <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="chiefMate">the Chief Mate</ecda:anonPers> went to the Captain, and
                                        expressed his Alarm on the Occasion. But the Captain desiring him to mind his own Business, and
                                        measure out the Salt, the Two Traders, with their Slaves, were accordingly admitted on board the
                                        Vessel.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Being now on board, they proceeded to the Captain's Cabin, with whom they were bargaining
                                        for their Slaves, when a fourth Canoe coming along-side, the Captain left them, to purchase
                                        Fish. They immediately took advantage of his Absence, and got Possession of the Key, that was
                                        hanging up in the Cabin, and that belonged to the Chain which confined their Countryman,
                                        <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>. This was immediately conveyed to him, and while the Captain was busy in 
                                        purchasing his Fish, he endeavoured to unlock his Chain.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><ecda:anonPers>The Carpenter</ecda:anonPers>, however, perceiving the Attempt that was now making, informed the Captain,
                                        when he was instantly seized by <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, and by the Assistance of <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-arc="black">another black Man</ecda:anonPers>, was
                                        confined. At the same Instant the Two Traders before mentioned seized the Captain, while those
                                        who overlooked the measuring of the Salt, pushed the Chief mate, Cooper, and others, overboard
                                        into the Canoe that was then lying at the Bows of the Vessel. By this Time some of the
                                        Canoe-men had jumped into the Brig, and the Canoes that were fishing at no great Distance from
                                        the Vessel joined them immediately, and great Numbers of the Natives were soon on board.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>They took care as speedily as possible to secure us, and to put us into their Canoes: When this
                                        was done, they released Bimbe jack, and Three <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> Traders who had been detained in
                                        the same Manner. They released also the <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">Bimbe</rs> Pawns, together with <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">Eight
                                        Men-boy Slaves</ecda:persGroup>, who were then upon the Deck. This being effected, they left the Vessel,
                                        carrying their Prisoners, Pawns, Slaves, and every Thing, on shore.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The black People, on our landing, were very riotous, but particularly the Women, who began
                                        to pelt us with Stones, Fish, Sand, and whatever they could collect, as well as to tear by main Force
                                        the very Clothes from our Backs. The Captain was stripped stark naked, and the same Collar
                                        (<persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> believes) was put upon his Neck which he had put upon <persName>Bimbe Jack's</persName>. He was
                                        chained with the same Chain to a Tree; and at the same Tree were confined the Carpenter and the
                                        Chief mate, in the same Manner, where they remained during the whole of the Night, several
                                        of the Natives walking round them with their Lances and Muskets, and guarding them. The 
                                        rest of us were disposed of at the different Traders Houses, and treated well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, however, though he had been so ill used, took compassion on his Oppressor, the
                                        Captain, and brought him a Coat to shelter him, and gave him some Rum and Water to
                                        drink. The next Morning he was released from the Tree, though he still walked about in the
                                        Chain and Collar, and was properly guarded and secured. As for the mate and Carpenter, they
                                        still remained at the Tree. The captain was detained in the Island from <date when="1788-05-07">May 7th, 1788</date> to <date when="1788-05-10">May
                                        the 10th</date>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>During this Time, it had been settled at a Palaver or Council of the Island, that the Captain,
                                        on account of his violent Behaviour, should give up to the Natives <emph>all the Articles of Trade that
                                        then remained<anchor xml:id="a09ish" corresp="#n09ish"/> in his Vessel</emph>; that the Pawns and Slaves that had been released should be forfeited
                                        to them; and that every Debt then due to the Ship should be cancelled; and that upon no other
                                        Terms should he and his People be released. In consequence of this, all the Articles of Trade 
                                        that <mcr xml:id="a10ish" corresp="#n10ish">remained</mcr>, which were sufficient for the Purchase of Thirty-six Slaves, were brought on shore,
                                        and we were all happily released.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Such were the Consequences of the Captain's rash Conduct to <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, and of his Endeavours
                                        to force a Trade; and such, <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> believes, have ever been, and will be, the Effects
                                        of such Treatment. A Boat belonging to the <ecda:shipName>Comet</ecda:shipName>, of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, was cut off by the Natives of
                                        <placeName>Fernandipo</placeName>, while on Trade for Yams, and but One Person was saved. Another Boat, belonging
                                        
                                        <pb/>
                                                <!-- ????? -->
                                        to the <name>John</name> of <placeName>London</placeName>, on her Passage from the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> to the <placeName>Cameroons</placeName>, shared
                                        the same Fate, and the whole Crew, amounting to Five, were killed. All this happened while we
                                        were at <placeName>Bimbe</placeName>; and so long as we continue to trade as we do, so long (<persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> believes)
                                        similar Instances will be found.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>To proceed: Besides the Instance of Captain Wilding's firing among the People of Bimbe,
                                        to make them pursue the Slave Trade, and Captain William' Conduct to Bimbe Jack, to make

                                    <p>Three <rs type="properAdjective">Cameroon</rs> Traders came one Night on board of us with their <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>, to trade; the Captain,
                                        for the same Reason as he had confined <persName>Bimbe Jack</persName>, seized them, and put them in Irons,
                                        and exactly on the same Pretence. They happened to be in Confinement when the Natives
                                        of <placeName>Bimbe</placeName> took the ship, as before related; and <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName> verily believes, that if they had not been
                                        released at that Time, we should have taken them to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and sold them for Slaves.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>At another Time <persName>Captain Williams</persName> had intrusted a <rs type="properAdjective">Bimbe</rs> Trader with as many Goods as
                                        were equivalent to the Purchase of a Slave; the Trader, having been at <placeName>Bunje</placeName> and other Places,
                                        returned with Two, One of which he sold to <persName>Captain Williams</persName>, and the other to <persName>Captain Wilding</persName>
                                        of the <ecda:shipName>Comet</ecda:shipName>, before mentioned. One Day afterwards he came on board of us with his
                                        <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">Two Brothers</ecda:persGroup>, when all the Three were seized and put in Irons by the Order of <persName>Captain
                                        Williams</persName>, because he had dared to sell a Slave to <persName>Captain Wilding</persName>; nor was One of them
                                        released till the King (whose Sons they were) had brought some Slave or Slaves to the Ship,
                                        and by these Means given him the Preference to the other. In this Manner did <persName>Captain
                                        Williams</persName> force a Trade, doing many arbitrary Things, nor did he ever consider in what Way a
                                        Slave was taken, so long as he could get him into his Possession; having often said, that if he had
                                        had a Ship of sufficient Force, he would have laid siege to the Island and have taken away all
                                        he could; which even now he threatens to do if he can get another Ship.

                                        <ecda:anonPers>a Child in her Arms</ecda:anonPers>. The Captain refused to purchase her on that Account, not wishing to be
                                        plagued with a Child on board; in consequence of this she was taken back to the Shore On
                                        the following Morning, however, she was again brought to us, but without the Child, and she
                                        was apparently in great Sorrow. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="trader" a-arc="black">Black Trader</ecda:anonPers> who brought her on board informed <persName>Mr. Arnold</persName>
                                        that the Child had been killed in the Night to accommodate us in the Sale.

                                <p>Art. 1. <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName> is of opinion, that many of the Negroes who are sold as Slaves
                                    become so by means of Treachery and Force. His Opinion in this respect is founded upon the
                                    following Circumstances; he never was on shore during the Time he was in the Slave Trade.
                                </p>
                                <p>When <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName> was up the <placeName>River Gaboon</placeName>, about Twenty-five Miles above <placeName>Parrot
                                    Island</placeName>, he has seen <name>King Abraham's People</name>, with their War Dresses on, go out in Bodies of
                                    Eight, Ten, and Fourteen at a Time, for the Purpose, as he was then informed, and as every
                                    body understood, to waylay and take the Negroes in another Quarter. These People were
                                    accustomed to go out with Muskets and Lances; but they had no Goods by which they could 
                                    purchase Slaves. They were often absent for Ten Days or a Fortnight at a Time; sometimes
                                    they would bring in Five or Six Captives, at other Times more, and at others less. The People
                                    so brought down shewed Marks of the greatest Grief.
                                </p>
                                <p>All this he has seen, and he has moreover been informed by the Traders themselves that
                                    the Natives were made Slaves of in this Manner.
                                </p>
                                <p>When <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName> sailed from <placeName>New York</placeName> to <placeName>Gaboon</placeName>, there was on board <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">the Son of one
                                    of the Kings</ecda:anonPers> of a District on that River. This young Man had been Twelve Months at <placeName>New
                                    York</placeName> for Education, and was then returning home. He was constantly saying how they obtained
                                    the Negroes for Slaves in his Part of the Country; and that if he should be so fortunate as to find
                                    a Vessel in that River trading for Slaves, he would become a great man, for he would arm his
                                    Father's People, and send them on such an Errand.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Henderson</persName> has also heard from the Slaves on board, that they were taken by Surprise in
                                    the Night, and brought down to the Ship.
                                </p>
                                <p>As a farther Proof of the Truth of <persName>Mr. Henderson's</persName> Assertion, he says, that in a former
                                    Voyage on board the <ecda:shipName>Trial</ecda:shipName>, was a young Lad of the Name <persName>Coffee</persName>, who had been put on
                                    board as a Pawn. This young Lad spoke the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Language, so as easily to be understood.
                                    He informed <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName>, that the People of the Shore were accustomed to go to the inland
                                    Country with Muskets and Lances, and catch all they could, and bring them afterwards down for Sale.
                                </p>
                                <p>Art. 2. <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName> has reason to believe, from the following Fact, that the White People put
                                    the same Practices in force upon the Blacks, as the Blacks do upon one another. While he was
                                    lying in <placeName>Gaboon River</placeName>, a <rs type="properAdjective">Liverpool</rs> Snow came in; Three Canoes immediately went on board
                                    her to trade; but as <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-arc="white">the Captain</ecda:anonPers> was not going to slave there, but further Leeward, he <!-- this ¶ is about white traders, so i'm taking from context that he's white, but feel free to delete if you think it's too much of a stretch. -->
                                    confined the People who came in them, to the Number of Twenty-five, and sailed off with them.
                                    Their Canoes he afterwards turned adrift; One of these came on shore where <persName>Mr. Henderson</persName>
                                    and a Party were cutting Wood, and they broke it up, at the Captain's Request, for Firewood.
                                    There happened to be at this Time in <placeName>Gaboon River</placeName> a large <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> Frigate-built Vessel, trading 
                                    for Slaves; this Vessel, in consequence of the Interruption of the Trade by means of the Act of
                                    Treachery mentioned, went in Pursuit of the <rs type="properAdjective">Liverpool</rs> Snow, but without Success.

                                <p>In the Trial, <persName>Captain Price</persName> took from the Coast Four Hostages or Pawns, who had not been
                                    redeemed, and sold them in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.

                        <p>The Number of Slaves that, on Average, are annually exported from these Three Kingdoms,
                            may be from 13,000 to 14,000. They are all exported by the <name>French</name> at present, except
                            at <placeName>Aberiss</placeName>, which is to the Southward of <placeName>Cabenda</placeName>, where <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> trades with Two small
                            Vessels, and gets about 400 Slaves per Annum. He believes there are no other <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Vessels
                            which trade there. He excepts also that Part of <placeName>Angola</placeName> which is in Possession of the <name>Portuguese</name>,

                            the Southward from <placeName>Loango St. Paul's</placeName> to <placeName>Fort St. Philip</placeName>, being an Extent of Coast of about
                            100 Leagues, from whence they annually export, according to the best Information he can collect,
                            to the Number of about 8000 Slaves.

                        <p>The <name>French</name> have been in the sole Possession of this Trade only Two Years. They have not
                            acquired it by Force, but by giving superior Prices for the Slaves, and by greater Encouragement
                            to the Trade in other Respects; namely, a Bounty to the Ships that trade in Slaves, and a Bounty
                            per Head upon Slaves imported into their Colonies in their own Bottoms.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, Whether the English or any other <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> nation had any Share
                            in this Trade formerly? replied, Only in Time of War, when we had almost the sole Possession
                            of it. During the Peace before the last War, the French drove us out of it in the same Manner
                            as they have done now. Being asked, From what Causes it had happened that the <name>French</name> have
                            succeeded by their Encouragement in turning us out of the Trade on this Part of the Coast of
                            <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and not on the other Part of it? he said, He believes it proceeds from the greater Facility
                            with which the Trade on this Part of the Coast is carried on, from the Manners of the Inhabitants,
                            which more resemble those of <name>Asiatics</name>, from the Beauty and better Accommodation of the
                            Country, and the superior Healthiness of the Climate. In Places where the Trade is carried on
                            with more Difficulty, and under greater Hardships, the <name>French</name> have not equal Spirit in meeting
                            us; besides, this Part of the Coast being nearest to the Isles of <placeName>Maritius</placeName> and <placeName>Bourbon</placeName>, the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> Ships chartered by Government to carry out Sotres to these Islands, return from thence to
                            this Part of the Coast with <rs type="properAdjective">India</rs> Goods for the Purpose of this Trade, and bring with them the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Goods with which they were laden in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, in order to complete their Assortment.
                            The <rs type="properAdjective">Angola</rs> Slaves are preferred in the Island of <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>, as they are of a milder Disposition,
                            and make the best House Slaves and Mechanics. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> observed, that the <name>French</name> 
                            by means of their Bounties are making a great Progress in this Trade in other Parts, particularly
                            at <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, <placeName>Lagos</placeName>, <placeName>Benin</placeName>, <placeName>New Calabar</placeName>, and <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, &amp;c, and have raised the Price
                            of Slaves, though our Trade has not yet greatly suffered by it, except in the Course of last
                            Year, in some Degree, at <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, <placeName>Lagos</placeName>, and <placeName>Bony</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves procured on this Part of the Coast, are either Delinquents, or Captives made in
                            War. many of them are brought from a Distance in the interior Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName>; <persName>Mr. Penny</persName>
                            believes from the very Centre of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, for he remembers when he was on this Coat in the
                            Year <date when="1783">1783</date>, he was told by One of the Princes, who was a considerable Trader, that he had been
                            up the Country, where he had met with other Traders, who said they had been at the opposite Sea,
                            where they had seen White Men. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> conceives this must have meant <placeName>Mozambique</placeName>.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not conceive that their Wars are made principally for the Purpose of acquiring
                            Slaves; but that they arise from Ambition and Resentment, as in other Countries. He speaks
                            only as Matter of Opinion, but believes there would not be fewer Wars if the Trade did not exist.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, whether he did not believe that Crimes were imputed for the Purpose of bringing
                            the People into a State of Slavery? he replied, That from the Experience he had had, he could
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            not charge his Memory with any Thing of that Sort; but there may be bad and wicked Men in
                            these Countries who may charge People with Crimes with this View.
                        </p>
                        <p>About Three Fourths of the Natives of these Kingdoms are in a State of Slavery, but the Masters
                            sell these Native Slaves to <name>Europeans</name>, <emph>only</emph> when they are guilty of Crimes; nor do they sell
                            them to one another, as he believes, when they have not been guilty of Crimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, who is the Judge of the Crime when they are sold to <name>Europeans</name> on account of
                            Delinquencies? <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> replied, That he could speak only of what passed on the Sea Coast.
                            There the Judicature consists of a Prince of the Blood, and of other Counsellors, who examine
                            Witnesses, and after Evidence taken, decide on the Fate of the Delinquent. He believes the
                            Prince, or the chief Governor of the Town, appoints these Judges. He has been present at Two
                            or Three of these Trials, and has seen the Persons accused acquitted, and great Demonstrations of
                            Joy expressed on such Occasions.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Crimes they are in such Cases accused of, are Murder, Adultery, Witchcraft, and Theft.</p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not know, that either upon this Coast, or any other Part of the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
                            the Natives breed Slaves for the Purpose of selling them; but the Head Men of this Country are
                            accounted more or less rich in proportion to the Number of Slaves they possess.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, if there is any Period of the Year in which it is more easy to purchase Slaves in
                            greater Numbers that at others? <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> said, that on this Coast they may be equally purchased
                            at any Time of the Year, except when there are Wars in the interior Part of the Country,
                            which put a Stop to the Trade for some Time, but afterwards they come in greater Numbers.
                            The greatest Traders from whom the Slaves are purchased on this Part of the Coast are the Princes,
                            but there are other inferior Traders besides, who either go themselves, or send up into the Country
                            for them, and are sometimes absent from Three to Six Weeks. Sometimes the Traders of 
                            the interior Part of the Country, who come from a great Distance, come down to the Sea Coast,
                            and bringing their Slaves; and in such Cases, the Traders resident on the Coast act as Brokers.
                            The Slaves that come from a Distance do not speak the same Language.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Slaves are purchased with <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Manufactures and <rs type="properAdjective">India</rs> Goods, principally Cotton and
                            Linen Cloths, and are never paid for with Money. With respect to the Manner of purchasing the
                            Slaves, <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not think that any Regulations could be made for their Benefit.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, whether he conceives this trade to be a profitable one in general to the
                            Merchant? replied, He thinks it, upon the whole, an advantageous Trade; and added, he
                            would beg leave to observe, that should this Trade be abolished, it would not only greatly affect the
                            Commercial Interest, but also the Landed Property of the County of <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>, and more particularly
                            the Town of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>; whose Fall, in that Case, would be as rapid as its Rise has been astonishing.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, if this Trade is profitable to the Captains employed therein? he said, Several of the
                            present Merchants were originally Captains in the Trade. They reckon at <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, that the
                            Profits of the Captains, the Mates, and the Surgeons, amount to about 55,000l. per Annum.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> got 150 Slaves in his Voyage to <placeName>Angola</placeName>, who were brought a great

                            say how those that were brought from a distant Part of the Country were got, but the Manner in
                            which the Inhabitant of the Coast was got was thus:—<ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="magistrate">One of the Magistrates of the Place</ecda:anonPers> wanted

                            condemned him, and ordered him to be sold immediately.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName> being asked, whether the French have a great Trade at <placeName>Angola</placeName> and <placeName>Bonny</placeName>?
                            replied, Since the Peace, they have driven us entirely out of the Trade at <placeName>Angola</placeName>; and at <placeName>Bonny</placeName>
                            they have almost as great a Trade as we have. Being asked, what was the Effect of the Suspension
                            of the Trade in Slaves during the War, and whether the Country appeared more cultivated in
                            consequences of the Suspension of the Trade? he replied, He believed the Effect of the Suspension
                            was only to make the Inhabitants more industrious, and oblige them to cultivate their Lands, as
                            he stated in his Pamphlet.
                        </p>
                        <p>This he has Reason to believe was not the Case at <placeName>Angola</placeName>, where, when they first arrived, they found

                            while the Report was preparing, and a few alterations were made 
                            in it upon Questions put to this Witness with his Consent.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> was with <persName>Commodore Thomson</persName> Two Voyages in the Years <date when="1783">1783</date> and <date when="1785">1785</date> on
                            board the <ecda:shipName>Grampus</ecda:shipName> to the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, as his Chaplain, Companion, and Friend. It was an
                            Object with the Commodore to land whenever he could, and to inquire of the Black People into
                            the Mode of obtaining Slaves: He never consulted the Whites on the Subject, as not thinking
                            them on that Continent worthy of any Credit. <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> always attended him on Shore, and was
                            always present at these Conferences with the Natives: It was impossible for <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> to put
                            down the several Instances and Relations then and there heard: He cannot therefore, from this
                            Circumstance, as well as that of a Want of Recollection, relate the Particulars; but as the Mind,
                            when impressed by numerous Facts, imperceptibly discerns and comes to some general Decision,
                            so what he has to offer with respect to the mode of obtaining Slaves, as well as the History of the
                            Seamen in the Slave Trade, is the Result of those particular Scenes and Narrative which were
                            laid before <persName>Commodore Thompson</persName> and himself in the Course of the Two Voyages above mentioned;
                            and this Result may be looked upon as true as if he was in Possession of all the particular
                            Transaction that gradually co-operated in producing it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 7. Upon examining into the various Ways by which the Natives of <placeName>Africa</placeName> were reduced
                            to a State of Slavery, <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> was almost universally informed by the Black Brokers, that
                            Crimes constituted One of the Ways by which they were doomed to Servitude; that the Revenue
                            of the Kings of the Country depended on the Sale of Slaves, and that they therefore
                            strained every Nerve to accuse to condemn. In consequence of which it was, that their
                            Codes of Law were made wholly subservient to the Slave Trade; that every Offence, however
                            trivial, was punished with Slavery, and that great Distinctions were made in Crimes, in order that
                            more might suffer; for there were some of such a Description, such as capital Crimes, or Crimes
                            of State, that not only perpetrator of them was forced into Slavery, but his innocent Family
                            and Relations.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 8. A second Source, from whence the Slave Trade derived its Continuance and Support,
                            was universally said to be War, which War appeared to be neither more or less than public Pillage
                            or Robbery. These Wars were made without any Provocation, and for no other
                            Purpose than that of getting Slaves. The Inhabitants of the different Villages were perpetually
                            making Inroads into the Territories of each other, and carrying off all they could meet with;
                            and they were induced to this, because there were generally Ships upon the Coast to take off
                            their Hands as many as they could catch and bring. This is all that <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> knows upon this
                            Subject. He has mentioned Crimes, and War or public Robbery, as the Two grand sources of
                            supplying the <name>Europeans</name> with Slaves; and this was the whole Result of his and <persName>Commodore
                            Thompson's</persName> Inquiries during the Two Voyages that they made to the Coast together.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 9 It appeared during the Examination of the different Black Traders by <persName>Commodore Thompson</persName>
                            and <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName>, that it has happened that when the marauding Parties have come down with
                            their Booty to the Water-side, there has been no Ship to take them away, and that they have on
                            such an Occasion killed their Captives. The reason given for such a Procedure was, that they
                            would not be at the Expence of maintaining them, and that they were unwilling to send them
                            back. These Murders, in the Opinion of <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName>, are all chargeable to the Slave Trade; for
                            if that Trade had not existed, the unhappy Sufferers would have been unmolested in their several
                            Habitations; they would never have been brought down the Coast; and the Circumstance of
                            Inability, or a Dislike to support and maintain them, and of Unwillingness to send them back,
                            would never have occurred.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 10. It was formerly a Custom with the <name>English</name> to prevail on the Natives to come on board
                            under Pretence of Traffice, and then to weigh Anchor, and take them off. This Custom has however
                            become less frequent than formerly. <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> remembers but One Instance of it while the
                            <ecda:shipName>Grampus</ecda:shipName> was upon the Coast.

                            Question put to them; but being desirous to testify their Readiness to obey their Lordships Commands,
                            upon this and every other Occasion, they were proceeding with every Degree of Attention
                            and Assiduity to collect the most correct Information on the Question of Reference they were able
                            by Application to such of their Servants, now in <placeName>England</placeName>, as have resided any considerable Time in
                            <placeName>Africa</placeName>. But understanding that the Question had also been referred to those Gentlemen individually,
                            by the Committee of the Company of Merchants trading to <placeName>Africa</placeName> did not Proceed further
                            in their Investigation, apprehending the Information they could have so collected would be laid
                            before this Committee by the Parties (from whom it must have been obtained) with more Advantage 
                            than by them and therefore begging to refer thereto; especially as any Thing they could offer
                            on the Subject must be the Effect of Inquiries rather than of local official Knowledge they can
                            possibly possess of the Matter of Reference.

                        <note><persName>Mr. Barnes</persName></note>
                        <p>In obedience to the Directions of the <orgName>Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade</orgName>, I
                            have considered the Question accompanying the Letter to me of the <date when="--05-19">19th May</date>, and for the More
                            perfect Satisfaction of their Lordships, I shall first examine the general Question, as it is stated
                            therein, and which I apprehend, if well answered, will leave very little to be said to the subsequent
                            branches of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The general Question is, To what Causes is the Difference of Male and Female Slaves exported
                            from the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> to be imputed.
                        </p>
                        <p>To which I answer, that this Difference appears to me to be imputable to the Three following
                            Causes, First, to the Practice of Polygamy which prevails throughout <placeName>Africa</placeName>. In all Countries
                            where there is a partial Appropriation of one Sex, there must be a proportional Redundancy of
                            the other. In the Popish Countries of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, the Celibacy of the different religious Orders of
                            Males must produce such a Redundancy of Females, for whom the only Provision is a Convent,
                            In all the different Nations of Polygamists, the unequal Distribution of the Females must on the
                            Contrary produce a still greater Redundancy of Males; a part of which may be disposed of in the
                            Levant, and in Barbary by the Plague, War, Castration, or a worse Prostitution. But the great
                            and universal Remedy in all such Countries is a Commerce in Slaves, which appears so indispensably
                            necessary, that I must question whether Polygamy could exist without it. Now in the
                            Negro Countries of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, where they have no Women but of their own Stock, where the
                            Plague is never felt, War but little destructive, Castration never practiced, and unnatural Passions
                            unknown, and where all the surrounding Nations resort for Slaves, it is very natural to conclude,
                            that the Redundancy of males must necessarily fall into this Channel.
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, To some of the very Causes of Slavery itself: Men are more exposed to the Dangers
                            of War than Women: They are more apt to commit civil Offenses, and in all such Cases, where
                            Males and Females are involved in the same Calamity, the first Cause still has its Operation, the 
                            young Females are kept for Wives, and the Males are sold for Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>And thirdly, To the Unfitness of Females for the Slave market at a much earlier Age than the Males.</p>
                        <p>A Woman, through Child-bearing, may appear a very exceptionable Slave at Twenty-two or
                            Twenty-three Years of Age; whereas a healthy well-made Man will not be objected to at Four or
                            Five and Thirty; consequently, if an equal Number of Females of like Ages were affixed
                            for Sale, a much greater Proportion of the Females would be rejected, not for sake of Assortment,
                            but on account of Quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to the first Division of their Lordships Question, viz. Whether the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> 
                            Traders prefer purchasing Males rather than Females, I have to observe, That though it is
                            impossible to conduct the Business either of a House or of a Plantation, without a Number of
                            Females, yet as the Nature of Slave Service in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, being chiefly Field Labour, 
                            requires, for the immediate Interest of the Planter, a greater Number of Males, the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Trader would of course wish to purchase his Assortment according to the Proportion wanted; but
                            the Fact is, he has not an Option, for the Reasons already mentioned; and in most Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
                            it is with great Difficulty he can get as many saleable Females as will form any tolerable
                            Assortment, which ought to consist of about One-third Part.
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the latter Division of the Question, it is so fully answered in what I have already said,
                            that I do not think it necessary to trouble their Lordships with any Thing further upon it.
                        </p>
                        <note><persName>Mr. Poplett</persName>.</note>
                        <p>Male Slaves are more hardy, easier obtained, and of less Value in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and more Value in
                            the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> than Females, who are more serviceable to their Owners in <placeName>Africa</placeName> than Men, from
                            their Labour in the Field, domestic Use, Subordination, and breeding Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Prime Male Slaves are generally sold in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> for 36 l. per Head; Women from 25 l.
                            to 30 l. and are more subject to Disease and Death at Sea than Men, and therefore less valuable to
                            the Traders.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pb/>
                        
                        <note><persName>Captain Heatley</persName>.</note>
                        <p>I can only assign Two Reasons for the Preference of Male to Female Slaves: First, the Male
                            is better able to stand the Fatigue of Passage: Secondly, the Male at particular Markets may
                            fetch from 5l. to 10l. Sterling per Head more than a Female. This is no general Rule, for a 
                            good <rs type="properAdjective">Angola</rs> or <rs type="properAdjective">Ebo</rs> Female Slave will fetch as much Price as a Male.
                        </p>
                        <p>The above are my Reasons, had I my Choice; but I never knew and Instance in the Course of
                            my Trade, where a good Female Slave, or Boy or Girl, was refused by the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Trader. I
                            have known many Instances, and have often been under the Necessity of purchasing very ordinary
                            Female Slaves, and have exchanged prime Males for such, in order to obtain a sufficient Number
                            of Females, to prepare the Provision for the Cargo. In the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName> the Corn is all pounded
                            and reduced to Flour in wooden Mortars.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Reasons I assign for the Disproportion of Female to Male Slaves, are, First, that Women
                            in <placeName>Africa</placeName> are fully employed in domestic Cares, nay mare, she works in the Field while the Male
                            is smoaking his Pipe, consequently she is not so much in the Way of Temptation, nor has she
                            the Opportunity for the Commission of Crimes as the Male.
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Natives, whose Riches consist in Slaves, prefer purchasing Females to Males for
                            very substantial Reasons; the Females (who are the labouring Part of the Community) are much
                            more tractable than the Male; nor are they so subject to elope from their Masters. It is customary
                            for the Natives to bring prime Males to a Ship or Factory to exchange for an indifferent or 
                            ordinary Female, or for small Boys and Girls, from Five to Ten Years of Age.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in the Wars few Women and Children are made Prisoners, If apprised of an Attack,
                            they remove the Women to Places of Security.
                        </p>
                        <note><persName>Mr. Eldrid</persName>.</note>
                        <p>The Difference in the Number of Male and Female Slaves, exported from the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, is
                            occasioned by the Demand in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName> being greater for the former than the latter.
                        </p>
                        <p>Female Slaves can be procured on the Coast with more Facility than Male Slaves.</p>
                        <note><persName>Mr Mathews</persName>, <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName>, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>.</note>
                        <p>The chief Causes, in our Opinion, that occasion a greater Number of Male than Female 
                            Slaves being brought to Market, are,
                        </p>
                        <p>First, Polygamy universally prevails in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and the Men of all Ranks, as often as their
                            Circumstances permit, increase the Number of their Women; the Fantees in particular seldom
                            part with a handsome Female Slave.
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, The retaining and incorporating Male Captives taken in War is deemed dangerous
                            and impolitic; they are therefore generally sold or put to Death, whilst the Females are reserved
                            for domestic Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, We believe that, except in the Article of Gallantry, Men are oftener guilty of Crimes,
                            by which they forfeit their Liberty, than Women.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Traders Find a greater Demand for Males in the newly settled Islands,
                            yet they take their Chance, and generally purchase every saleable Slave that offers of either Sex.
                            At <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName> and <placeName>Angola</placeName> they sometimes give even a superior Price for Women to Assort their
                            Cargoes, although Women sell in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> for Forty Shillings less than Men.
                        </p>
                        <note><persName>Rev. Mr. Newton</persName>.</note>
                        <p>On the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> of <placeName>Africa</placeName> (the only Part I am acquainted with), and at the Time I
                            was there, the Number of Male Slaves purchased usually exceed that of the Females in the
                            Proportion of about Four to Three, and sometimes of Three to Two, This Difference was not
                            owing to any Preference given by the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Purchasers for though the Males were in fact
                            preferred to Females, because they yielded a better Price in our Islands, yet all the Slaves that were
                            offered (if judged saleable) were brought without a Discrimination, and the same Price given upon
                            the Coast for a Woman, and even for a Girl, if taller than Four Feet Four Inches, as for a stout
                            full grown young Man. I cannot with Certainty assign the Reasons why fewer Females than
                            Males are brought to the Ships and Boats for Sale; and it would be impertinent to take up Time
                            with mere Conjectures; I shall therefore only observe, upon this Part of the Question, that some
                            Persons think (and it seems not improbable) that a very considerable Part of the Slaves sold
                            to the Ships and Boats are kidnapped or stolen. If so, it may be supposed that Females, who
                            abide chiefly in their Towns, are less exposed to this Danger than the Males, whom the Purposes
                            of Hunting or Traffic may lead further and more frequently from Home: And as Polygamy
                            generally prevails in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, it is possible that some Female Captives may be reserved in their
                            Families, who would otherwise be sold.
                        </p>
                        <note><persName>Mr. Falconbridge</persName>.</note>
                        <p>On the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, the Captains of Slave Ships never wish to purchase more than One-
                            third Females. The Planters in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> in most Cases prefer Males, because they lose
                            the Labour of a Female in the latter End of Pregnancy, and for a little Time afterwards; the
                            Child is some Years before it can be put to Labour. In my Opinion, if the <name>Europeans</name> were so
                            disposed, they could purchase in <placeName>Africa</placeName> (at least) as many Females as Males.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pb/>
                        
                        <p>The Difference in the Number of Male and Female Slaves exported from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, arises from
                            various Causes: As far as respects the Exportation from the Gold Coast, the following Reasons
                            may be assigned.
                        </p>
                        <p>First, That almost every Man in <placeName>Africa</placeName> keeps Two Wives, some Three, and many People of
                            Consequence from Twenty to Thirty; indeed we now and then hear of a King, or other great
                            Men, having One hundred or more in their Seraglio.
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, That the Crimes which chiefly subject the People of that Country to Slavery, are
                            such as the Men are most subject to: they are great Gamesters; Gaming begets Debt, and Debt
                            often tempts them to Theft. Again, Adultery is sometimes pardoned in the Women, but never
                            in the Men; the latter must pay the Forfeit, or be sold; indeed, where the Connection has been
                            with the Wives of great Men, no Ransom is admitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is the Custom of the Country to employ Women in all domestic Stations, scarce
                            such a Thing being known except on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> as a Man Servant (One Bosum, or confidential
                            Slave, in great Families, excepted) but such as serve <name>Europeans</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p>To the above may be added the prevailing Opinion, that many of the Slaves sent from <placeName>Africa</placeName>
                            have been Captives taken in War: If this Opinion be well founded, (and I believe it may apply 
                            to certain Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName>), it accounts also in some Measure or the Number of Males exceeding
                            the Females, as it may reasonably be supposed few of the latter take the Field.
                        </p>
                        <p><rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Traders generally prefer Two Thirds Males and One Third Females, if they can so
                            assort them; but Women are sometimes so scarce, that it is difficult to obtain even that Proportion.
                            This Preference of Males to Females arises from the former being more eagerly sought for
                            by the Purchaser in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>.

                        <p>In Conformity with the Desire of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade, communicated to
                            me by Letter of <date when="--05-19">19th of May</date>, I have to answer, that the Women are much more difficult to be
                            procured in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, from the Following Causes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Every Man in the Country (be he ever so poor) never keeps less than Two or Three Wives;
                            those in middling Circumstances from Ten to Fifteen or Twenty. These Women are generally
                            employed, and act in every Respect as Servants, which Men in that Country (unless amongs the
                            <name>Europeans</name>) are never suffered to do; hence the Usefulness of the Women renders them scarce;
                            ad to which, very few of them are sold for any other Crime than Adultery, and that is very
                            often forgiven them; whereas the Men being liable to Slavery from Theft, Adultery, Gambling,
                            &amp;c. their number sold must of Course bear no Proportion to the Women.
                        </p>
                        <p>From the above Cause it being evident, that there is no Proportion between the Numbers of the
                            former and the latter sold, that must account for the present Mode of making <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Purchases,
                            which is often Two Males to One Female, and even this Proportion it is very often hard to
                            obtain.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Reason why there are fewer Female than Male Slaves exported in Ships from the Gold
                            Coast is the Difficulty of procuring them on that Part of the Coast, the young Women being kept
                            in the Country by the rich and powerful Natives. The same Reason operates in the <rs type="properAdjective">Eboe</rs> Country;
                            but a still stronger Motive induces the Natives not to dispose of them, which is, that it is the
                            Custom of the Country for the Women to work in the Field, and do other laborious Offices:
                            Of course Captains of Ships have it not in their Power to purchase more young Female Slaves
                            than are offered for Sale; and it certainly would be an Act of Inhumanity, as well as bad Policy,
                            to bring off aged Women.

                        <p>The <placeName>West India</placeName> Islands being the great Mart for Slaves to the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Traders from the
                            Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and the Culture of the Sugar cane, and Management through all its laborious
                            Stages, for which the Male Slaves are chiefly purchased more peculiarly adapted, is evidently
                            the Reason why the Preference is given to that Sex. A Boy of Twelve Years of Age will in
                            general sell for more than a Woman of Twenty, but full grown young Men are in highest
                            Estimation; Health, Strength, and Bone having every Preference, and exactly in the same
                            Proportion with a Planter at <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> or the <placeName>Windward Islands</placeName>, as it would in a Dray Hourse to a
                            Garman in <placeName>London</placeName>: All Handicrafts of seasoned Negroes excepted.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Females are mostly purchased for domestic Uses, and consequently (in Plantations) are
                            not required in a Proportion of more than One to Four or Five. I estimate this Proportion, and
                            at this Distance of Time, by Guess; but to the best of my Judgement, Experience, and Recollection,
                            I never heard of any Difficulty in procuring Female Slaves on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>; on
                            the contrary, they are frequently pressed, if not forced on the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Trader, by the Black
                            Merchant, who will not part with a Lot of Males alone, although at the same Time fewer in
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            Proportion are brought down to the Sea Side, deterred do doubt by the difficulty of selling
                            them, for many of these come by Water down the Rivers, or in Droves, from Seven to Eight
                            hundred Miles Inland on the Coast of <placeName>Gambia</placeName>, far beyond the Source of that River, which
                            exceeds this Distance from the Sea.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <rs type="properAdjective">West India</rs> Sea Ports, and Inland Towns, the domestic Slaves cannot well be prevented
                            from increasing; but in the Plantations, Experience will convince every impartial Enquirer and
                            Observer, it is quite the Reverse, as much the larger Proportion of Planters would, and certainly
                            do, yearly replace their Slaves at the Expence of from 40l to 60l. a Head, as the Markets
                            fluctuate, with what they term Healthy new Negroes, rather than breed them, and look forward
                            form Sixteen to Eighteen Years for their full and actual Service.

                        <p>From <placeName>Cape Blanco</placeName> down almost to <placeName>Senegal</placeName>, the Soil is nothing but Sand; from <placeName>Senegal</placeName>
                            to <placeName>Cape Verd</placeName>, the Country begins to be in some Places hilly and woody; and from <placeName>Cape
                            Verd</placeName> down almost to Gambia, there are Woods and Mountains, some of the latter very high.
                            The Valleys between are sandy, but mixed with a great Number of Shells. <persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> has
                            observed that the Sugar Cane, Tobacco, and particularly Cotton and Indico of a good Quality,
                            grow there.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked if any of these Articles are made use of in the Country by way of Merchandize?
                            he replied, The first Trial of this Sort was made last Year by a <name>Frenchman</name>, who carried from
                            thence to <placeName>France</placeName>, some Dye Woods, Cotton, and Indico, to see whether they would answer.
                            The Indico was not made into Cakes, but only boiled down a little for the Convenience of 
                            Carriage.

                        <p>The Nature of the Soil is Sand, and a little Clay and Marle, but it is very fruitful; it produces
                            in great Plenty Two Sorts of Millet, some Sorts of Pulse, and Fruits of various Kinds, Cotton
                            and Indico wild. He never Saw any Tobacco there; there are Canes of a great Height, and of
                            a sugary Taste, which might produce Sugar; none of these Articles are cultivated for Exportation
                            except Millet, which is sold the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Traders, for Food for the Slaves.

                        <p>The Question being put to <persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> and to <persName>Dr. Spaarman</persName>, whether they thought that
                            by any and what Encouragement, the Natives of this Country might be induced to cultivate the
                            above Articles, so as to make them Objects of Commerce? <persName>Mr. Wadstrom</persName> gave it as his
                            Opinion that the only Encouragement would be by settling a Colony of <name>Europeans</name> there, and 
                            though they would proceed by very slow Degrees, yet they would gradually reconcile the Princes
                            and the Natives of the Country to it; and he added, that he should himself be glad to be One of
                            the First to engage in such an Undertaking.

                            paying them for their Labour, They have at present some Sort of Industry, which by Example
                            might be increased. They would not at once be brought to regular and diurnal Labour, but by
                            little and little they might be reconciled to it.

                        <p>The Part of the Country <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has had Occasion to see, was well inhabited. The
                            Soil, which is a Mixture of Sand and Black Earth, is remarkably fertile, producing, with very little
                            Labour, Two Species of the Millet, the large and the small, in great Abundance. It produces
                            also without Cultivation, the Sugar Cane, Indico, Tobacco, (which he believes to be a Plant
                            indigenous to the Country, but cannot positively say), and Two Species of Cotton; the Tree
                            which is Fifteen Feet in Height, and the Shrub never rising above Two Feet. The last produces
                            a Cotton of a very fine Staple, of which their Pagnes are made; a Plant which bears a Cotton
                            of a Nankeen Colour, is cultivated in several Places near the Cape, but <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has
                            Reason to think that this Plant has been imported from the <placeName>East Indies</placeName> by the <name>French</name>.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> does not know that the Negroes cultivate the Sugar Cane, they are ignorant of
                            the Art of extracting Sugar from it; but from the great Quantity they consume, it would seem
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            that at particular Seasons of the Year it constituted some Part of their Food. They have no Rice
                            in this Part of the Country, but a great deal grows in Senegal, and on the River Gambia. All the 
                            Tobacco that grows here is the Effect of Cultivation. They prefer ours as stronger. It does not
                            consist with his own Knowledge that they prefer our Tobacco to their own, but <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName>
                            has been told it by some Captains in the Trade of that Country. Indigo grows without Cultivation
                            in most Parts of this Coast, is superior in Quality to the best produced in our <placeName>West India
                            Islands</placeName>, and is scarcely inferior to that which grows in the Province of <placeName>Guatimala</placeName>. The Negroes
                            use it to dye their Pagnes, or Cotton Cloths, which are commonly striped blue and white.
                            They gather the Leaves at all Seasons indifferently, which they pound into wooden Trays, and make
                            up in Balls; these Balls, when used are infused in cold Water, in which Wood Ashes have been
                            dissolved. <persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> does not know whether any of this Indigo has been exported.
                        </p>
                        <p>Tobacco grows in considerable Quantities on this part of the Coast, but the Negroes are ignorant
                            of the Mode of curing it. He cannot speak as to the Quality of it, but remembers that for 
                            smoaking our Soldiers preferred it to that of <placeName>America</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides the above mentioned Plants, this Country produces some Ginger, and a considerable Quantity
                            of that Species of Pepper known by the Name of Malaguetta, or Grains of Paradise,
                            much used by Distillers of Spirits in this Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here also are found Groves of Ebony, the Tree called Koss by the Natives, several Species 
                            of the Acasia, and on the high Lands about the Cape, the Gum Dragon, besides many other
                            Trees, all of which would answer for Cabinet Work.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Country produces some slaves, though not in great Numbers, some Ivory, and a 
                            considerable Quantity of Wax.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Trade in Ivory and Wax is not carried on to any great Amount. There is a great deal of
                            Cabinet Wood, but it is not exported.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has heard that this Country extends inwards about 200 Miles, but believes no

                            Country.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has seen a Town containing near 3,000 Inhabitants. The Houses are made with
                            Reeds, and Finished in the inside with a considerable Degree of Taste and Neatness, and are kept
                            extremely clean. The usual Food of the People is Millet, which is produced with little Labour.
                            They have Pease, Beans, Cucumbers, and Melons. They sometimes eat Meat, but seldom.
                            They have great Herds of Cattle, Cows, Goats, and Horses; but the latter not in great
                            Numbers.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> has heard that the Country is less populous since the Introduction of the Slave
                            Trade, though he never saw any ruined Villages. The Villages are entirely built with Reeds; so
                            that a whole Town, in case of being destroyed by Fire, can be rebuilt in a few Days; but if it
                            should not be rebuilt, Vegetation is so vigorous, that the Spot where the Town stood, is in the 
                            course of a few Weeks covered with long Grass and Bushes.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalrymple</persName> being asked, what Encouragement would, in his Opinion, contribute to extend
                            the Trade in the above Articles of Produce? replied, He did not pretend to give any Answer to 
                            that Question.

                        <p>The People in these Countries have an Idea of Property in Land, beyond that which arises from
                            immediate Occupancy. The Property of all Land is supposed to be in the King, which e distributes
                            out to the Village, and takes away again at his Pleasure. The Alcaide of the village distributes
                            it among the several Inhabitants thereof, in proportion to their Wealth, and in conformity
                            to his, the Alcaide's, Pleasure. On this Land they raise Two Species of Guinea Corn, and the 
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> Corn, the Manyoc, which is a Species of Yam, and great Abundance of the large
                            Water Melon; as also great Quantities of Rice, which is very cheap there, and with which they
                            feed themselves and the Slaves they breed there. There are <name>Europeans</name>, <name>English</name> and <name>French</name>,
                            settled on the Side of the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>, and also in the Kingdom of <placeName>Demel</placeName>, who have
                            purchased Land for very inconsiderable Quantities of Brandy and other Articles of Traffic, on which
                            they raise, in Addition to the abovementioned Articles, Bananas, Plantains, Oranges, (which also
                            grow wild) Indigo, Cotton, and the Palmetto Tree, from whence they draw the Palm Oil and
                            Wine; from the Root of this Tree, they Draw Oil, and from the upper Part, under the 
                            Branches, they draw the Wine, my Means of Incisions made in the Bark. The Cotton is the
                            finest in the World: There are Three Sorts of it, fine White, coarse White, and Cotton Rouge;
                            there is also another Species of a Pink Colour, but this is very little used. The French live in
                            greater Familiarity and have considerably greater Interest with the People than we have.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Natives cultivate a great Number of these last Mentioned Articles; but neither the 
                            <name>Europeans</name> nor the Natives grow any of them for Exportation; they grow them merely for their own
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            Consumption; they do not export any; there is no Encouragement given, for there are none to
                            purchase them. If Encouragement was given, <persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> is of Opinion they might be brought
                            to cultivate a great deal of them, by which the Country would be much benefited. The People
                            of these Countries have very little Personal Property, for they have no Security for it, but are
                            forced to hide in the Earth what they have: It is not that the Government takes away their
                            Property, but they would steal it from one another.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Natives make use of their Cotton in spinning Pagnes, which are their Covering both by
                            Day and Night, The Men wear One Pagne, which they fling over their Shoulders. The Women
                            Two. This applies only to People of superior Ranks; the inferior Ranks wear only a Clout.
                            They tear the Cotton from the Seed, either with Cards they buy from the <name>Europeans</name>, or with
                            Fish Teeth in Imitation of them. Their Art of weaving does not extend to a Cloth of more than
                            Five Inches in Breadth, and the Operation is very tedious, for it will take a Man and a Woman
                            near a Twelvemonth to make a Pair of Pagnes, that is, what a Woman wears.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Question being asked, Whether there are great Quantities of unappropriated and uncultivated
                            Land in these Countries? <persName>Mr. Poplet</persName> replied, There are vast Quantities. Taking these
                            Four Kingdoms together, not one Fiftieth Part is appropriated or cultivated. Being asked,
                            Whether <name>Europeans</name> live in Security there? he said, They live in great Security there. The King
                            protects them, because it is his Interest. There are Two <name>Englishmen</name>, of the Name <persName>Sewel</persName>
                            and <persName>Perkins</persName>, who have lived in this Country about Sixteen or Seventeen Years. One of them
                            lives at <placeName>Vintagn</placeName>, which is in the upper Part of the Dominions of the King of <placeName>Barra</placeName>: The other at
                            <placeName>Barrachonda</placeName> and <placeName>Yanamaroo</placeName>, the Two uppermost Settlements that the <name>English</name> visit on the <placeName>Gambia</placeName>,
                            about 400 Miles from the Sea. These Two Men are Merchants, and trade in Slaves, Ivory,
                            Gold and Wax, and they bring these Commodities to our Factories, down the River. They
                            secure their Property from Theft by keeping it on board their Vessels. If <name>Europeans</name> travel in
                            this Country, they are secured in their Journey, from one Village to another, as being Strangers,
                            each Village taking them, as such, under their Protection. These People are very hospitable, but
                            at the same Time they are Thieves.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> being asked, Whether he conceived the People of these Countries could, by any
                            Encouragement, be rendered industrious, so as to raise or produce Articles of Trade for Exportation?
                            replied, This Country is rich and capable of producing any Thing. The Men have Strength
                            and Ability to work, but their natural Indolence, and their Love of Intoxication, is such, that it
                            would be very difficult and a Work of Time to render them industrious. Some however of the
                            King's Slaves, purchased for the Use of the Garrison, were as industrious, as zealous, and as faithful
                            as any Men <persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> ever met with, and when the Garrison was attacked fought with as
                            much Bravery.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> being asked, Whether he thought it possible to establish a Colony of <name>Europeans</name> in
                            these Countries, and what Security such Colony would have from the Natives? replied, He
                            thought it very possible. That they must first build a Town, with a Ditch round it, as a Security;
                            for, if they had not some Security in the Beginning, they would be put to Death by the Natives
                            for the Sake of their Tools; but by afterwards forming Connexions with the Natives, they
                            might extend themselves, and at length obtain Security, by teaching the Natives the Arts, and
                            convincing them of the Benefit of Civilization. The Place he should recommend for forming
                            such a Colony is <placeName>Bunyon Point</placeName>, on the Southern Side of the Mouth of the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>, in the
                            Dominions of the <persName>Emperor of <placeName>Phonio</placeName></persName>, who is a great Friend to the <name>English</name>, and whose Country
                            is the most fertile of any <persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> ever saw on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. <placeName>Bunyon Point</placeName> is almost
                            an Island, or at least a Peninsula, which gives it great Advantage in point of Situation. It has
                            an Eminence also in the Centre, which commands, in a great Degree, the Entrance into the
                            <placeName>Gambia</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether the Principles of the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Religion would not prevent the Settlement
                            of a <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Colony in that Country? He gave it as his Opinion, that it would not: and being
                            asked, Whether the Climate is such that <name>Europeans</name> could exist there? he replied, The Climate
                            is the same as in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and he thinks they might be able to labour early in the Morning;
                            but Cotton and Indigo might be manufactured any Hour of the Day, because the Work is
                            carried on under Cover. <persName>Mr. Poplett</persName> has seen Cane Slips brought from <placeName>St. Jago</placeName> planted on the
                            <placeName>Gambia</placeName> and grow very luxuriantly, but the People are ignorant of the Art of making Sugar.

                        <p><persName>Captain Wilson</persName> being asked if he had observed any Thing of the Produce of the Country?
                            replied, They are very ingenious People. They cultivate Cotton, weave it, and make very fine
                            Manufactures for their own use. They grow Rice, <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> Corn, and Tobacco, sufficient for their
                            own Consumption, but not for Exportation. The Climate is fit for all Tropical Articles. They
                            have some Implements of Husbandry; he cannot say that they are industrious, they have no Spur
                            to Industry. <persName>Captain Wilson</persName> has no Doubt if we had a Demand for their Articles of Produce, they
                            would increase the Cultivation of their Lands. They are very handy in whatever they attempt.

                            Their Household Utensils and Instruments of War are neatly made. They import Iron from us,
                            which they manufacture themselves, and they import some Instruments ready made. <persName>Captain
                            Wilson</persName> does not suppose One fiftieth Part of the Land is in Cultivation.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> produces Cotton in great Abundance, some Tobacco, and a little Indigo,
                            with the common Corn of the Country, which the Natives eat. They have likewise great Quantities
                            of Cattle, and Poultry of all Sorts, and some Deer. <persName>Captain Hills</persName> thinks that the Cotton,
                            Tobacco, and Indigo, grow spontaneously, but not the Corn. Being asked, Whether the Natives
                            understand how to manage or spin their Cotton, or make their Indigo? he replied, They manufacture
                            the Cotton and make Cloths of it, which they wear, but they do not prepare it in a
                            Manner to make it fit for an Object of Exportation. The Indigo they do not manufacture at all;
                            and it was only here and there that Captain Hills saw the Plant growing.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether, in his Opinion, the Natives could be induced by any Encouragement
                            to manufacture these Articles in such a Way as to become Articles of Commerce? <persName>Captain Hills</persName>
                            gave it as his Opinion they could not; and added, They are in general exceedingly indolent.

                        <p>The Country on the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName> is not well cultivated. It is fertile, but more woody, and
                            less cultivated than <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>. There are Towns that contain 2,000 or 3,000 Inhabitants.
                            They are a gentle and humane People, indolent, and mind nothing but getting enough to eat, and
                            Slaves to sell. <persName>Mr. Gandy</persName> has been perhaps further than any <name>European</name> ever went up the Country
                            in search of some of his Crew, and was every where treated with the greatest Kindness and
                            Hospitality. They have Millet in Abundance, and Cattle and Poultry.

                        <p>The Country on the River <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> is very rich, but thinly inhabited, and not more cultivated
                            than to produce Subsistence for the Inhabitants. Their Food is chiefly Rice. The Climate is not 
                            hotter than in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. They have Indigo and Cotton, but he does not know that they
                            cultivate these Articles. They cultivate them more to the Leeward, and he has seen Cotton Cloths
                            that have been manufactured there, and dyed in other Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName>.

                            might be from Five to Ten Tons. Gold is rated so high by the Natives that it is not an 
                            advantageous Object of Commerce to us. They have Indigo and Cotton, and Rice enough for their
                            own Consumption; but none of these Articles in Quantity sufficient for Exportation. <persName>Captain
                            Heatley</persName> does not think the Natives, by any Encouragement, could be induced to cultivate these
                            Articles in Quantity sufficient for Exportation; their Indolence would prevent it; for even for
                            their own Consumption they never cultivate more than is absolutely wanted for the Year. They
                            have no Property in Land beyond that which arises from immediate Occupancy.

                            On the Banks of the <placeName>Gambia</placeName> for the Purpose of cultivating Plantations there? replied, The Country
                            is extremely fit for it, but the Climate is very unhealthy, and the Settlers would be exposed to
                            Danger from the Natives. In some Islands they might be secure. <persName>Captain Heatley's</persName> Health in

                        <p><persName>Sir George Yonge</persName> has observed very little Cultivation indeed on any Parts of the Coast,
                            except near <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, a few Acres (perhaps One hundred) cleared by setting Fire to the
                            Woods, and sown with Rice and Millet, up the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>. He has seen great Quantities of Cotton of
                            Two Sorts growing, viz. The White and Nankeen Colour. At <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> there is a great
                            Quantity of Iron Ore. Indigo and the Sugar Cane grow wild there. The Indigo he takes to be of a
                            superior Quality. In point of Fertility this Part of the Coast is equal, if not superior to any Part
                            of the World, and, if cultivated, would produce all the tropical Commodities in the greatest 
                            Perfection and Abundance. The Field Labours are usually performed by Women. The Men hunt,
                            and we never can get them to work for us. The Country abounds in beautiful and valuable
                            Woods that are full of Gum and Honey. There are also great Quantities of Game.

                            what Inducements he thought should be held out to them for that Purpose? replied, It could only

                            Attention, and clearing the Country, the Unhealthiness wold be much diminished, He does not
                            believe that the Climate is more unhealthy than in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; on the contrary, he believes
                            some Parts of the hilly Country, near <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, are as healthy as any Part of the World.

                        <p>Rice is the staple Commodity of this Part of the Coast; there is Ivory in small Quantity, some
                            Gum Copal, Indigo (which grows spontaneously), Cotton, Tobacco (but very little of it), the
                            Sugar Cane, and all the Tropical Fruits.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, Whether he thought that Commerce in any of these Articles could
                            be carried on to a greater Extent than at present? replied, He apprehends not, from the
                            Indolence of the Inhabitants. They make some small Quantity of coarse Cotton Cloth, but the
                            Process is so tedious, that we can supply them cheaper than they can make it. Their Dye of
                            Blue is singularly fine; the Process of dying it is very simple, but our Manufacturers could not
                            afford to dye it in that Way.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, if the Disposition of the Natives is so indolent that no Encouragement could induce
                            them to labour more than they do at present, either in cultivating Lands, or in any Article
                            of Commerce? <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> gave it as his Opinion, that it would be difficult, if not impossible.
                            They are certainly more industrious on this Part of the Coast than on the other; in consequence
                            of which, they supply a certain Quantity of Rice for the Use of the Ships.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not know that any of the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Settlements ever endeavoured to make the

                        <p>Rice is the principal Article of Produce on this Part of the Coast, and Camwood and some
                            Ivory. The Trade in Camwood and Ivory is carried at present as far as it can be, till the Natives
                            are possessed of more Industry. The Quality of the Rice is very Good, and particularly that
                            which grows on the Hills and sloping Ground. The Quantity purchased annually for the Consumption
                            of the Ships and Factories may be from 700 to 1,000 Tons; the Average Price he takes
                            to be from 6l. 10s. to 7l. per Ton, and it is sometimes as hight as 10l.; but <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> has
                            bought it so low as 2l. but then he paid for it in Tobacco <emph>only</emph>, and it was an extraordinary
                            Year of Plenty. Their Seasons vary much in the different Years. The Cotton is cultivated with less
                            Labour than the Rice, not more than in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. It grows very abundantly, but
                            they cannot be tempted, by any Rewards that have been offered, to cultivate it to greater Extent
                            than what is sufficient for their own Use. There are Three Sorts of Cotton; White, Brown, and
                            Pale Pink; the First is of a good Staple, the Two others very Indifferent.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> being asked, What Rewards had been offered to tempt the Natives to cultivate
                            Cotton to a greater Extent? replied, He had offered them as much as he thought the Cloth to
                            be produced from a given Quantity of Cotton would be worth when made, and it would have
                            stood him in about 9d. per lb. uncleaned, and with the Seeds in; he has made this Offer
                            frequently, but never could get any; and knows <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="trader" a-gender="male">a very intelligent Man</ecda:anonPers>, a Trader, who resides on
                            the Coast, who has made the same Offer, (and <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> believes something higher), but
                            could only get a few Pounds.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Soil on this Coast does not produce any other Articles of Trade at present, but for Food
                            a great Variety. Indigo grows there wild, in great Perfection and large Quantity. The Portuguese
                            had formerly Two Indigo Works established there; One at the <placeName>Rio Pongeos</placeName>, and the other
                            upon the <placeName>Island of Jaffa</placeName>, in the River <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>. The Natives use the Indigo in dying. <persName>Mr.
                            Mathews</persName> does not know how the Indigo is prepared, but it gives their Cloths a bright indelible
                            Blue.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is Timber fit for every Purpose; It does not bear any Affinity to ours, but would make
                            beautiful Furniture; it odes not grow in great Abundance, especially near the Sea Coast, where
                            the <name>Europeans</name> have cut it mostly down for their own Use: They have always had Permission to
                            cut it without paying any Thing but a Present of a Jar of Liquor, or some such trifling Thing,
                            as an Acknowledgement for the Liberty given them. The Natives are very tenacious of their
                            Rights, but the Timber is of no Use to them, who have no Instruments to work it, nor would
                            they be at the Trouble if they had.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pepper grows there, and of the same Sort as in the <placeName>West-Indies</placeName>; and there are also some 
                            Aromatics. Tobacco grows in some Parts, but for Want of proper Cultivation, the Quality is so
                            bad, that the Natives themselves never use it unless in Times of Scarcity, or when they cannot
                            get it from us. <persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> believes this may be owing to the Want of proper Cultivation, and
                            to their Ignorance of the Mode of drying it.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Mathews</persName> does not know of any Drugs; but there is some Gum Copal, though not in great 
                            Abundance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Palm Oil is purchased for the Use of the Slaves, but not for Exportation to <placeName>England</placeName>; further
                            to <placeName>Leeward</placeName>, Three Gallons of Palm Oil might be purchased for the Price of One at <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>.
                            There are some Skins of Tygers and Leopards, but not sufficient to become an object of Trade;
                            they are generally disposed of as Presents.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Natives are very fond of our manufactures; and having now been used to them so long,
                            they would certainly find it very uncomfortable to be deprived of them.

                        <p>The Country is a fine Soil, generally woody, but some Savannahs. They have little Cattle
                            except Goats; but they have Poultry. They grow Rice, and have Bees-wax, and a dying Wood,
                            called Camwood. They might cultivate Rice to some Extent, if they had the Means of selling 
                            it. They have Pepper; also a Sort of Cardamum. They have also Tobacco in small Quantities,
                            which they grow merely for their own Use.
                        </p>
                        <p>They have Cotton in Plenty, and might have more if they had a Vent for it. They make
                            Cotton Cloths, which are rather coarse, but costly. Their Cloths are generally Nine Inches in
                            Width, and Two Yards and a Half in Length. Six of the best of these sewed together sell from
                            2l. to 6l. or 7l.; they dye them of a beautiful Blue, which <persName>Mr. Newton</persName> concludes is produced
                            from Indigo.
                        </p>
                        <p>The People are gentle, when they have no Communication with the <name>Europeans</name>; they are

                            at Heart; but the Slave Trade naturally has a Tendency to make both the Natives and the People
                            employed in it ferocious.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, What other Branches of Commerce besides Slaves are carried on
                            from the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>? replied, Gold and Ivory, but to no great Amount. Being asked, Whether
                            he conceived the Trade in Gold, Ivory, and other Articles of Produce in these Countries, could
                            be augmented. Gold is purchased so dear on the Coast that it is not worth buying, but
                            as a Medium for the Purchase of Slaves; an Ounce of Gold is worth For Pounds Sterling on
                            the Invoice Price of our Goods.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether there are any other Commodities to be purchased there? he replied,
                            The <name>Dutch</name> have obliged the Slaves in their Settlements to cultivate Cotton, but the Natives do
                            not cultivate it on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> much. At <placeName>Whydah</placeName> and <placeName>Eyo</placeName> the cultivate it more and
                            many Cloths are made from it for the Use of the Inhabitants of the Country
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Cultivation of Cotton to Advantage in any Part of these Countries, <persName>Mr.
                            Norris</persName> cannot pretend to say what might be done; but at present a Bag of Cotton could not be
                            procured for any Consideration.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether he conceived that any Encouragement would induce the Inhabitants to
                            employ themselves in the Cultivation of Cotton? <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> replied, He has do doubt, that if
                            encouraged, they would cultivate it, for they will naturally endeavour to procure Articles with 
                            which to purchase these Commodities they want. The Soil at <placeName>Whydah</placeName> is as good as any in the
                            World, and would certainly produce Cotton. On the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> the Soil is rocky.—<persName>Mr. Norris</persName>
                            has seen a little Cotton on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName>, and has no Doubt it will grow on any Part of
                            the Coast. He is not particularly enough acquainted with the Nature of the Cultivation of Cotton
                            to say what Soil produces it best. The <placeName>Bahamas</placeName>, which produce the best Cotton in his
                            Majesty's Dominions, are of a Rocky Soil. Therefore from Analogy <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> concludes the
                            <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> might produce it too. He has heard it said in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, by Persons who understand 
                            Cotton better than himself, that they had not the best Sort of Plants. The long Staple is coarse,
                            the finer Quality is of a short Staple; but if better Plants were introduced, there is no Doubt but
                            they would grow. He supposes all Tropical Commodities would grow there. Indico grows every
                            where near <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, but the Natives have neither Art nor Disposition to prepare it for Market.
                            Tobacco grows in many Places. The interior Part of the Country  where he has been is as
                            capable of producing these Articles as the Sea Coast. From the Country of <placeName>Eyo</placeName> they send down a
                            Quantity of Cotton and Grass Manufactures. Being asked, Whether he supposes, that if Orders
                            were given to the Captains of <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Vessels to take these Articles in Return for Manufactures, and
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            the Natives were apprized thereof, great Quantities of them would be produced? he replied, Of
                            Cotton, the Natives might certainly produce great Quantities; but Tobacco and Indigo would require the
                            Management of <name>Europeans</name> to put them in a State fit for Sale. Rice they might cultivate to a
                            much greater Extent; but they could hardly be able to fit if for an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Market; it would
                            do for the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. The <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Rice is of the best Quality in the World. The Sale of
                            <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Dying Woods cannot be much extended, because the few Ships now employed in the
                            Wood Trade, already have overstocked the Market, particularly with <rs type="properAdjective">Angola</rs> Bar Wood or Red
                            Wood. The Sale of Cabinet Woods might be extended. He cannot judge how far the Market
                            would take off a greater Quantity of Gums, but more might certainly be supplied. He never
                            saw Mahogany on the Coast, but there is a Tree called a Doom Tree, which is an inferior Sort
                            of it. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> thinks that in so extensive a Country, there must be many Articles with which
                            we are unacquainted. He once saw a Quantity of Pepper of the Quality of that brought from the
                            <placeName>East Indies</placeName>; it was so good that the <orgName>East India Company</orgName> objected to its Importation. He has
                            seen a Variety of Spices and Plants of which he does not know the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Names; he has met
                            with a little Berry that serves the Natives of <placeName>Whydah</placeName> as a Substitute for Sugar; it has no Taste in
                            itself, but every thing that is taken after it, receives a Sweetness from it. Palm Oil, which is an
                            Article brought Home for the Wool-combers in <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>, and Soap-boilers, is at present
                            imported in large Quantities, and might probably be had in greater Abundance. Some Peltry
                            is at present procured, such as Tyger and Leopard Skins &amp;c. &amp;c. The People in general are
                            extremely indolent. The Men sleep and smoak, and the Women Once a Year put a little Corn
                            in the Ground, the Task of Agriculture being chiefly consigned to them.

                        <p>There is no Property in Land in these Countries, but what arises from immediate Occupancy.
                            <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> never heard of Land being sold there.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Produce on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> Corn, Millet of several Sorts, Yams, Potatoes, Tropical
                            Fruits, and Rice, which on the Grain Coast is of an excellent Quality, and might be procured
                            very cheap. They have remarkably fine Indigo, and dye blue well; and from a Crimson Colour 
                            they dye, <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> concludes they have Cochineal. Tobacco grows wild. The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>
                            and <placeName>Whydah</placeName> is the finest Country in the World; he never saw a finer in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. It would produce
                            all these Articles in the greatest Quantity, and of the best Kinds. Cotton grows there, but
                            it is at present of so little Value that the small Quantity that grows is to be bought for almost
                            nothing. It is of an excellent Quality, and never subject to Blight or Worm. Sugar might be
                            cultivated there of a very good Quality.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> being asked, Whether he thought that by proper Encouragement a Quantity of
                            these Articles might be supplied for Exportation? replied, He imagined they certainly might.
                            The King values himself on the Number of his Subjects, and if he could procure <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Commodities by their Labour, he would certainly prefer employing them in that Way to selling
                            them. They might be brought to Labour; they have Capacity and natural Parts enough to
                            learn whatever might be taught them, and would become industrious if properly encouraged.
                            They have many Virtues, and great Courage and Attachment to their Masters and Benefactors.
                            They are healthy and robust People. It has been an Object of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Policy to prevent the
                            <name>Africans</name> from arriving at Perfection in these Articles, form a Fear of interfering with established
                            Branches of Commerce elsewhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked if he could suggest what Encouragement it might be proper to give, in order to
                            induce the Natives to cultivate all the above Articles of Produce in sufficient Quantities for
                            an export Trade? he replied, It must be by the <name>Europeans</name> setting them the Example. At
                            present the <name>Africans</name> could not do it of themselves, as they have no Knowledge of the Methods
                            of preparing Cotton, Tobacco, Sugar, Indigo, and other dying Plants, so as to make them fit
                            for Exportation. If the <orgName>African Company</orgName> were to give Directions to their Servants there, and
                            give them a little Encouragement, they might certainly induce them to undertake the 
                            preparing some of these Articles for Exportation, particularly Cotton and Indigo.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> being asked, what he conceived to be the Reason why, if this Plan was likely 
                            to succeed in the Manner he has suggested, no <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Government has hitherto attempted to
                            settle a Colony there? he replied, He believed the Reason to be, that the Climate is very prejudicial
                            to the Health of the <name>Europeans</name>, and that they would not be induced to remain there; besides,
                            as he had said before, <name>Europeans</name> may have been averse to open new Branches of Commerce,
                            that might interfere with an established Commerce elsewhere.

                            Proportion of Deaths might be had from the <orgName>African Company</orgName>.

                        <p>Being asked, whether the Unhealthiness of the Climate would not prevent a sufficient Number
                            of <name>Europeans</name> from residing amongst them to set the Natives the Example, and teach them to 
                            cultivate the Articles above mentioned? <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> gave it as his Opinion, that the Number of
                            <name>Europeans</name> now there is sufficient.

                        <p>Gold and Ivory in small Quantities are the only Articles this Country produces for Exportation.
                            A Trade solely confined to Gold and Ivory would probably be a losing One; at least <persName>Mr. Miles</persName>
                            has found it so: A sufficient Cargo would not be produces in any reasonable Time. There are no
                            Dyeing Woods in this Part. No Rice, and by very little Tobacco. <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> never saw more
                            than a Plant or Two as a Curiosity. Indigo grows wild about <placeName>Accra</placeName>, with which the Inhabitants
                            dye their own Cloths. Between <placeName>Accra</placeName> and the <placeName>River Volta</placeName> it is a fine low, level, rich, Country,
                            the Rest is mountainous. They cultivate as much <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> Corn and Grain as will supply their own
                            Wants and the Demand of the Shipping. They cut likewise great Quantities of Firewood for the

                        <p>With respect to the Possibility of inducing the People of this Part of the Coast by any Encouragement 
                            we could give them to cultivate any Article of Exportation, <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> said, He thought
                            it could not be done, because you could not excite Habits of Industry in them.

                        <p>There is a little Trade for Ivory and Gold upon this Coast, but it is very inconsiderable, so that
                            it would not be worth any Man's while to engage in that alone. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> does not apprehend
                            it could be possible to encrease the Trade in Ivory and Gold; believes there have been
                            Endeavours to extend it; but it has been found that the Vessels already employed in it are too
                            numerous. Being asked, Whether the People upon the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> are honest and fair in their Dealings?
                            he replied, As Negroes he thought them in general fair Dealers. With respect to the <name>Europeans</name>
                            dealing fairly with them, he said he never knew an Instance to the contrary, nor would the
                            Natives suffer it. They are sharp in their Dealings; and he has known them to impose base Gold, 
                            particularly in the Instance of <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="captain">the Captain of a <rs type="properAdjective">Bristol</rs> Ship</ecda:anonPers>, who was induced to take the Value of
                            about 1,500l. of it to his Ruin.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> being asked, whether it would be possible to induce the Natives to grow other Articles
                            of Commerce for the Purpose of Exportation? replied, Sugar, Indigo, Cotton and Dyeing
                            Woods grow there already spontaneously. they have also Rice; but he does not think that the Natives
                            have any Idea of cultivating or preparing these Articles for Exportation. Example has been
                            set them by the <name>Dutch</name> at <placeName>Axim</placeName> in the Article of Cotton, but they have not been able to induce
                            the Natives to work or to follow the Example. The <name>Dutch</name> cultivate the Cotton by their own
                            Slaves, but not in great Quantity; but the Governor is obliged to send home to the <orgName>Dutch West
                            India Company</orgName> a certain Quantity of Cotton every Year, or to pay a Fine.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> being asked, Whether they among themselves have any Property in Land? replied,
                            We pay a Ground Rent to the King of the Country for our Settlement; but among themselves,
                            the sole Right to any Piece of Land is the present Occupancy. If there is a vacant Piece of Land
                            any Man may occupy it, and it is considered so much his own, that if any Negro steals an Ear of
                            Corn growing upon it he is liable to be tried and sold. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> never heard of any Land being
                            sold from Negro to Negro. This Country is very populous.

                        <p>The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> produces, as Objects of Commerce, besides Slaves, Gold and Ivory: Gold
                            sells for £.4 per Ounce, and is therefore seldom carried off, except by the <name>Dutch</name>. The Quantity
                            of Ivory obtained here is not considerable.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Country would produce Sugar, Cotton, Tobacco, Indigo, Dying Woods, and other valuable
                            Articles of Produce, but very little of any of these Articles is actually raised. <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> has
                            heard that <persName>Governor Melville</persName> planted Cotton at <placeName>Cape Coast</placeName>, which succeeded; but the abandoned
                            his Project, and <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> has understood it was discouraged, in Consequence of the Opinion of
                            the late <orgName>Board of Trade</orgName>.

                        <p><placeName>Mr. Dalzell</placeName> being asked, Whether he thought that by proper Encouragement any of these
                            Articles would become Objects of Exportation? replied, The Soil is very prolific, and the Natives
                            might be induced to work for Hire; but Property and Plantations would be no where secure, except
                            under the guns of our Forts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, whether he conceived that an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Colony could be established on the Coast
                            of <placeName>Africa</placeName>? he replied, By no Means; it would be a wild Project. Free White Traders, of which he
                            has known several at a Distance from the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Forts, are often so harrassed with Disputes with
                            the Natives, and Depredations on their Property, that they have been obliged to abandon their
                            Settlements.

                        <p>Being asked, Whether he thought an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Colony could not protect itself? he replied, By

                        <p>The Produce of this Part of the Country is Calavancies, <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> Corn, Potatoes, and
                            Yams; the Sugar Cane, which generally grows wild; Cotton, of which they manufacture a great 
                            deal for their own Use; and Indigo, or a Plant that dyes a very good Blue like it. There is little
                            or no Tobacco, for there is a great Consumption of Portugues Tobacco; some few Dying Woods,
                            but not sufficient to be an Object of Commerce; a small Quantity of Ivory, some Spices, Cayenne
                            Pepper, and as <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> believes, the real black Pepper. There are no Gums, that he knows
                            of, in any Quantity for trade.

                            Object of Exportation; and being desired to state the Grounds of his Opinion? replied, No. He 
                            looks upon the Obstacles to be insuperable. Ivory, which is one of the primary Objects, cannot be
                            increased in Quantity. Cotton might be raised in any Quantity, provided the Planter's Property
                            could be secured; but <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> thinks that not only in the Kingdom of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>, but all over
                            the Coast, this Object is not to be attained, on account of the frequent Revolutions in their 
                            Governments.—Being asked, Whether he believes there is Industry enough in the Natives, supposing other
                            Obstacles were removed and proper Encouragement given, to induce them to cultivate these
                            Articles for the Purpose of Commerce? <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> replied, No.—He thought they would revolt
                            at any Thing that required great Labour or Ingenuity. As a Proof, during his Stay at <placeName>Whydah</placeName>,
                            there happened to be a very scarce Season of Corn, which induced the Natives to plant more
                            than the ordinary Quantity the ensuing Year, which reduce the Price to One Fifth Part; but
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> believes, if this Scarcity had not spurred them on, they would have never undertaken
                            the Labour of Cultivation to that Extent; and the Proof is, the Necessity ceasing, they ceased the
                            extraordinary Cultivation. A further Proof of their Want of Exertion is, that though we introduce,
                            in the Business of the Forts, <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Tools and Arts. and oblige the Natives employed
                            by us there to make Use of them, yet, out of the Fort, the Natives practice only their Own Arts
                            and Methods which are much slower than ours: They will, nevertheless, sometimes produce Specimens
                            of considerable Ingenuity:—He does not think the Defect is in their Understanding, but it
                            consists in their Want of Exertion when not forced to work.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> believes they have not any Idea of private Property in Land, beyond immediate
                            Occupancy: Every Person possesses quietly whatever he has once cleared and cultivated. There
                            is, however, more than Half the Country remaining uncleared and uncultivated.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> being asked, Whether he supposes it possible that an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Colony could be
                            Established in this Country; and being desired to state the Grounds of this Opinion? replied, It
                            would be exceedingly difficult to establish a Colony there, from the Insecurity, which could only be
                            removed by Conquest of the Country; and though all the high Lands, such as the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>,
                            and Parts about <placeName>Angola</placeName>, are as healthy as the <placeName>West-India Islands</placeName>, all the low Lands, and the Banks
                            of the Rivers are exceedingly fatal to <name>Europeans</name>.

                        <byline><persName>Mr. Penny</persName>.</byline>
                        <p>At <placeName>Bonny</placeName> the Country produces a few Yams, &amp;c. but not sufficient for their Subsistence. A
                            great Quantity of Yams are produced at <placeName>Andomey</placeName> and <placeName>Creek</placeName>, which supply the Town of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>,
                            and are brought in Canoes for the Supply of the Ships in the Trade. At <placeName>New Calabar</placeName> the Produce
                            is much the same, and the Inhabitants are obliged to be supplied with their provisions from the 
                            neighbouring Countries.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yams are not the sole, but the principal Provision of these People: They have likewise a few
                            Plantains, great Quantities of Fish, and a few Goats and Fowls. In the interior Part of the
                            Country they grow some Tobacco, but no Rice. We do not import Tobacco there for Sale, the
                            Natives get if from the interior Country, but do not use much of it.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no Gold Dust, but some Ivory: About Two or Three Tons of Ivory are exported
                            Annually. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> is of Opinion, that the Export Trade, in Ivory and other Articles, could not
                            be increased, and that the Inhabitants of this Country could not be induced to cultivate any Object
                            of Commerce, by any Encouragement we could give them.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has never seen any Cotton grow in this Country:—He has seen some Cotton Cloths
                            of a remarkable coarse Quality, but never any Cotton in the Wool.
                        </p>
                        <p>They have no Dying Woods in this Part, but Palm Oil in great Plenty, and some few Skins of
                            Leopards and Tygers, which they get as Presents.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has been told, that the interior Country is a fine one; but the Coast, for above Thirty
                            Leagues inland, is all swampy. The Country, at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> and <placeName>New Calabar</placeName>, is not so populous as
                            the interior Country, owing to the Swampiness of the Ground.

                        <p>The Country was well inhabited as far as Captain hall went up the Rivers, which was Fifteen
                            Leagues up the <placeName>River Del Rey</placeName>, and Ten Leagues up the <placeName>River Calabar</placeName>. The Banks of the
                            Rivers, till you come near the Towns, are covered with Mangrove Woods: Near the Towns, the
                            Land is cultivated. None of these were Objects of Commerce:—But <persName>Captain Hall</persName> is of the Opinion, that
                            if their Attention was not so much engaged on the Slave Trade, the People would employ themselves
                            more in Agriculture.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Hall</persName> paid coarse Cotton Cloths in Exchanged for the Rice he bought on the <placeName>Windward
                            Coast</placeName>, and for the Slaves. The Rice he purchased was of a good Quality, and bough it very
                            cheap: It is much better and cheaper than the <rs type="properAdjective">Carolina</rs> Rice, and <persName>Captain Hall</persName> supposes, might
                            be afforded here cheaper than the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> Rice: It is in greater Abundance on the <placeName>Grain Coast</placeName>.
                            In <placeName>Africa</placeName>, Rice grows in a dry Soil; in <placeName>America</placeName>, in a Soil that is wet, and therefore we think the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Rice the more hearty. On the <placeName>River Calabar</placeName> they have neither Gum nor Woods, but on
                            the <placeName>River Gaboon</placeName>, which is near it, they have Woods. In the Bight, <persName>Captain Hall</persName> observed they 
                            smoaked Tobacco, which was chiefly their own Growth. He never heard they had any Cotton;
                            has seen them bright fine fresh Sugar Canes alongside the Ship, but never saw any Canes growing in
                            the Country.

                        <p>In the norther Part of the Coast, that is, <placeName>Majumba</placeName>, the Country produces a Dying Wood,
                            called Bar Wood, and a small Quantity of Ivory; in which Two or three Ships of about 600
                            Tons Burthen are employed by us annually. All along this Part of the Coast, the Country
                            produces Pulse, Cassada, a few Yams, Cayenne Pepper, a little Ginger, some Cassia, of an inferior Sort,
                            and some Tobacco in the interior Part of the Country, and the common Tropical Fruits. <persName>Mr.
                            Penny</persName> saw no Indigo nor Cotton, but the Sugar Cane grows in Place spontaneously.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, Whether he conceived the Inhabitants on this Part of the Coast could
                            be induced, by any proper Encouragement, to cultivate the Sugar Cane, or any other Species of
                            Produce abovementioned, so as to make them Articles of Commerce? replied, He did not, and for
                            this Reason: Though the Country is beautiful and prolific, beyond any other Part of the Coast he
                            had visited, yet the Natives are so indolent that they will not cultivate it. They do not produce
                            even Provisions for Sustenance for the Slaves we purchase of them in the Voyage to the <placeName>West-
                            Indies</placeName>; and it is the established Custom, both of the <name>French</name> and <name>English</name>, to bring to this Part of
                            the Coast, from <placeName>Europe</placeName>, all the Provision that they may want in the Voyage. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> added, that
                            he observed, all along the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, that, in Proportion as the Country is fruitful, the
                            Inhabitants are naturally more indolent.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being asked, Whether he imagined the Commerce between this Country and this Part
                            of the Coast could be increased in any of these Articles? he answered, No: For, as to the Bar
                            Wood, which constitutes the principal Commerce, we already import as much as we can consume:
                            There is now a great Quantity of it lying at Liverpool: And as the Inhabitants are so indolent,
                            that they do not even cultivate Provisions beyond what Necessity requires, it is not likely they
                            would labour to produce Articles merely commercial.

                        <head>The following Evidence of the <persName>Reverend Isham Baggs</persName> of <placeName>Yarlington</placeName>,
                            near <placeName>Wincanton</placeName>, <placeName>Somerset</placeName>, was delivered by them to the Committee;
                            <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> being brought to the Committee by <persName>Mr. Clarkson</persName> while the
                            Report was preparing; and a few Alterations were made in it upon
                            Questions put to this Witness, with his consent.
                        </head>
                        <p>Par. 1. The Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, if the Value of it should be drawn from its many and various
                            Productions, would be most inestimable. The very Woods of the Country are sufficient of
                            themselves to render it of Importance; but its many other valuable Commodities taken into the
                            Account, that Continent will stand unrivalled by any other on the Globe.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Woods that are most common, or rather the most known, are Camwood, Barwood,
                            Lignum Vitæ, and Ebony; when <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> was at the Island of <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName> under the Line, a
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Portuguese</rs> Officer shewed him a small Collection of Woods which he had made from the different
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            <name>Guineamen</name> that touched there. He had taken some Pains to polish, and afterwards to arrange
                            them in a small cabinet. There were several different Shades of the Sattin Wood, and as many
                            from a pale Pink to a Crimson, which in several Sorts of ornamental Work would have been
                            considered as inestimable in this Country. <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> has also seen some beautiful Mahogany upon the
                            Coast; but the Gentlemen at the Island of <placeName>St. Thomas</placeName>, now alluded to, assured him that he had
                            frequently seen very fine and large Pieces of that valuable Wood in the Ships before mentioned.
                            <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> brought home some Cassia or wild Cinnamon from the Coast, which he gave to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="apothecary">an
                            Apothecary</ecda:anonPers> for Trial. The Apothecary used it in his Practice, and pronounced it to be as good
                            as any he had ever in his Shop. <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> says, that there are various other Woods of medicinal
                            Virtue, and no Doubt but that a Botanist might make a very valuable Acquisition for the Materia
                            Medica, by a Collection of Barks and Plants.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 2. The Coasts to Windward produce various Sorts of valuable Gums, of the great Advantage
                            of which Merchandize the <name>French</name> are so sensible, that a Company of Merchants had in it Contemplation
                            to build Storehouses at <placeName>Goree</placeName> (for so the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="governor">Governor of that Place</ecda:anonPers> informed <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName>), and
                            that they might avoid the Bar of the <placeName>River Senegal</placeName>, to bring it over Land from <placeName>Senegal</placeName> to the
                            former Place, though the Distance is estimated at One hundred and fifty Miles; a positive Proof
                            of the immense Value of that Article, which would bear the Expence upon it of so considerable an
                            inland Carriage.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 3. The Land up the <placeName>Rivers Gambia</placeName> and <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName> is particularly fertile in Rice, Corn,
                            and Cotton, especially the Silk Cotton Tree, which grows very large, and produces Pods of Nine
                            Inches long, and Three round. This Cotton is uncommonly fine, and, if properly managed,
                            would be little inferior to the Production of the Silk Worm. <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> saw also another Species
                            of Cotton, which was of a pale Pink. He brought home with him a Pod of it. The Staple was
                            sufficiently long for the Manufacturer, and the Cotton was of a beautiful Colour.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 4. The Indigo Plant is another of the Productions of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, that deserves Mention. The
                            Blue of it much exceeds that of the same Plant in other Parts. It is of so lively a Colour, that
                            <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> can compare it to nothing else but the beautiful Blue which is found in the real
                            China.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 5. The Country to <placeName>Cape Three Points</placeName> and <placeName>Apollonia</placeName> has been but little explored,
                            though it produces Ivory and some Gold. <placeName>Cape Appollonia</placeName> is wonderfully rich, and productive
                            in Gold Dust, Ivory, a Variety of Grains, Rice, Millet, <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> Corn, Spices, and Peppers of
                            various Sorts (of which latter <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> brought home the Black), and Fruits and Vegetables,
                            and is equally so, as far as <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> has seen, to <placeName>cape Lopez de Gonsalves</placeName>. In this Description
                            he cannot omit to mention the Country about <placeName>Accra</placeName>, it being so fine and open, like the large
                            Corn Fields in <placeName>Wilts</placeName> and <placeName>Dorset</placeName>, and is particularly fertile. The same in point of Fertility may
                            be said of <placeName>Whidah</placeName>, the Cloths of which are interwoven with such Colours, as shew the Excellency
                            of the various Dyes that must undoubtedly be there.
                        </p>
                        <p>Par. 6. <persName>Mr. Baggs</persName> is of opinion, that on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> there must be ample Field for
                            the Naturalist in the Fossil World. He has seen Spars that were perfectly transparent, and that
                            would bear the engraving Tool as well as the best Cornelian. This short Account of the Productions
                            of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, not as founded upon Hearsay, but as having come under his own Knowledge;
                            to mention every Article, and do descant upon the Properties and Value of each, would take a
                            considerable Time, and it would require a Volume to contain them. Of the Natives it may
                            be sufficient to say, that many of them are inclined to be industrious; that they are excellent
                            Workmen, particularly those of <placeName>Whidah</placeName>, and have some Taste; as a Proof of which <persName>Mr.
                            Baggs</persName> would refer to their Cloths, which, for their Neatness of Texture, and the fanciful
                            Manner of introducing and working different Animals in them, would not discredit any civilized

                        <p>With respect to Culture on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, the Lands about <placeName>Accra</placeName> were in as high a State

                        <p><persName>Sydenham Teaste</persName>, Esq. Merchant of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, trading to <placeName>Africa</placeName>, but not in the Article
                            of Slaves, gives the following Account of the Articles of Produce imported from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, in the
                            Course of his Trade there.
                        </p>
                        <p>The principal Article is Ivory, which is the most valuable Return they have; but the Country
                            is at present nearly exhausted of that Commodity, but may mend.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next in Value is Camwood, which was worth from 28 l to 30 l. per Ton, when <persName>Mr.
                            Teaste's</persName> last Ships sailed, and is now fallen to 24l.—The Market is over.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pb/>
                        
                        <p>The next is Gum Copal. The greatest Quantity <persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> ever imported o this Article, is
                            24 Cwt.—Uncleaned, it is worth from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per lb. when of good Quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next Article is Red Wood, which comes from <placeName>Gaboon</placeName>; and Bar Wood, which comes from
                            <placeName>Angola</placeName>.—Bar Wood sells from 6l. 10s to 7l. per Ton; the other at 5l per Ton. Neither of
                            these Articles will bear a Freight at this Price.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another Article, Palm Oil, which <persName>Mr. Teaste's</persName> House has not yet imported; but
                            means, in the next Voyage to purchase some of it.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> having given in a List of Vessels, which their Tonnage, employed from the Port of
                            <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, in the Ivory and Wood Trade, to <placeName>Africa</placeName>, was asked, Whether these Ships are employed
                            to Profit in this Trade? and replied, That with respect to his own Ships, he did not make more
                            than 5 per Cent beyond legal Interest. His House is in the Trade, and therefore goes on with it;
                            but if his Capital was out of it, he would not now go into it. With respect to the other People, they
                            may have done better but it has been owing to their having small Wages to pay, in consequence
                            of the Mortality on board their Ships. Being asked, Whether this Trade has ever been more
                            profitable, and when? <persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> said, The Trade has not been tried more than Five Years
                            and a Half; and during that Time, as far as he has been concerned in it, has been much
                            upon the present Footing, How it may turn out this Year, he cannot say, but fears not
                            well.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> being asked, whether from his Knowledge of the Trade, he conceived that a greater
                            Quantity of these Articles might be imported to his Advantage? replied, he thinks a greater
                            Quantity cannot be imported to Advantage, as there is already as much imported as there is a
                            Demand for. About half the Quantity of Ivory now imported is brought home in the Slave Ships,
                            and could not be imported in any other Way to Profit, as there is no Demand for the bulky
                            Articles which must make up the Cargo.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> being desired to inform the Committee whether any other Articles besides those
                            he had mentioned, could by proper Encouragement be procured from <placeName>Africa</placeName>? replied, A Quantity
                            of Bees Wax is already imported, as much as can be procured. Ebony may be had in any
                            Quantity, but there is no Demand for it in this Market. Gold in greater Quantities may be had,
                            but it cannot be bought to Profit.
                        </p>
                        <p>Large Quantities of Cotton grow in the Country; <persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> never imported any, but has
                            heard, that One Pack has been imported. It is difficult to know at what Price it may be god,
                            as the Experiment has not yet been much tried. <persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> has directed the Captains employed
                            by him, to bring home all the Information they can on the Subject of new Articles for
                            Trade. 
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Teaste</persName> being asked, Whether, from Information he has received, he imagines that the
                            Natives could by proper Encouragement be induced to cultivate Cotton, or any other Article for
                            Exportation? replied, The Climate is much against Labour. The Land newly turned up produces
                            noxious Exhalations, as he has been told. The natives are generally indolent, but towards
                            the <placeName>Rio Pongeos</placeName> near the <rs type="properAdjective">Arab</rs> Country they are more industrious.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Clarkson</persName> cannot exactly say from what Part of the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> these Articles were
                            brought. The Black Pepper was brought from <placeName>Whydah</placeName>.—The Cotton from the <placeName>River Gambia</placeName>.
                            They were in general given to him by the Importers. The Indigo and Musk were given to
                            him by <persName>Dr. Turner</persName> of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, who received them from <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">a Gentleman</ecda:anonPers> who brought them

                            delivered in further Specimens of <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Productions, viz. A Specimen of Cotton-Wool, the

                        <p>A Specimen of Yellow dying Wood, which was sent to <persName>Mr. Chamberlayne Goodwin</persName>, for his
                            Opinion, whether a good Dye can be extracted therefrom.
                        </p>
                        <p>And Specimens of other Sorts of Wood (the Growth of <placeName>Africa</placeName>) which were sent by their Lordships

                            thereupon in the following Words.

                            <p>The Sample of Cotton from <placeName>Senegal</placeName> is very good and fine, as your Lordships will see by
                                the Specimen inclosed, which is spun after the Rate of One hundred and forty Hanks, Twist
                                Cotton Yarn, to the Pound, and it is thought superior in quality to <emph>any</emph> of the <rs type="properAdjective">Brazil</rs> Cotton,
                                and <emph>nearly equal</emph> to <placeName>East India</placeName>.

                            <p>The Sample of Cotton from <placeName>Bermuda</placeName> is by no Means equal to that from <placeName>Senegal</placeName>, but from
                                the good Properties of its Staple, silky Appearance, even in its Colour, and clean, promises
                                to be a very useful Cotton in the <rs type="properAdjective">Fustian</rs> Manufactory, which comprises the strong Goods dyed
                                for Exportation, and in which there is <emph>always</emph> a great Consumption, and has hitherto been

                                <rs type="properAdjective">Fustian</rs> dyed Trade for Exportation, which is very great from Cotton of this Staple.

                                Trade wished me to make some Trial of, appearing to me to bear the greatest Resemblance to that
                                Kind of Wood called <distinct rend="italic">Old Fustic</distinct> is the dying a yellow on Woollen, I took
                                four Pieces of that Kind of Woolen Goods, known by the Name of Long Ells, and that
                                they might all be equally prepared, I boiled them together in a strong Solution of Alum and
                                Argol, as is practiced by the Woollen Dyers; then taking an Ounce of the Chips of Old Fustic,
                                such as you now receive a Specimen of, I boiled them 15 Minutes in a Pint and half of clean 
                                Water, in a Tin Vessel; at the end of 15 Minutes, I put into the Liquor the Two Pieces
                                marked A. and continued the Boiling Twenty Minutes, then washed the Pieces in cold Water,
                                and the Colour produced is as you see by the Samples.
                            </p>
                            <p>Having procured a Part of the Wood sent to be cut into Chips, I boiled One Once of
                                those Chips in a Pint and half of Water 15 Minutes; at the End of that Time, I put into the
                                Liquor the Two remaining Pieces of Long Ell, prepared as aforesaid, by boiling with Alum
                                and Argol; they were kept boiling with the Chips 20 Minutes, then taken out, rinced in cold
                                Water, and marked B. B.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Colour produced on Woollen by boiling this Wood, is so different from what might
                                be expected from its Appearance, that I thought it proper to make Trial of it on Silk, and
                                therefore having prepared a small Piece of Silk with Alum, it was boiled with some Chips of the
                                Wood, and the Sample will shew the Event.
                            </p>
                            <p>From so small a Sample it is not possible to make such Trials as will prove the Value of this
                                Wood to the Manufacturer; but as it yields a Colour of consequence to the Dyer, there is every
                                Reason to believe it may prove of considerable Utility, if it can be imported at such Price as will
                                enable the Workmen to make Use of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>With respect to the Specimens of Cabinet Woods sent to <persName>Messrs. Haig</persName> and <persName>Chippendaile</persName>,
                                <persName>Mr. Haig</persName> reports, that upon Enquiry after Two of the said Samples, he finds the Purple
                                Wood, on Average, sells for about £4 or £5 per Cwt. but that the Consumption of it
                                is very small: A trifling Ship's Cargo would last this Town Twenty or Thirty Years.

                        <p><persName>Captain Deane</persName>, Commander of a Vessel in the Wood and Ivory Trade, being asked,
                            whether his Employers found the Trade in Wood and Ivory (in which he states himself to have been
                            principally employed) a profitable Trade? replied, He believes they did; he has known them
                            to make a considerable Profit, but the Trade is much hurt from the Slave Ships purchasing the
                            said Articles, which the Persons in his Branch of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade go solely to bring home.
                            Being asked, in what Wood he principally traded? replied, In Camwood, which is a Wood used
                            principally in Dyeing, and is of the same Nature with the Red Sanders Wood, imported from the
                            <placeName>East Indies</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Camwood was not cut by his own People, but by the Natives who bring it in Canoes
                            to the White Factors settled on the Coast, of whom <persName>Captain Deane</persName> bought it. This Trade is
                            carried on by Barter, and the Commanders of Ships give in Exchange all Sorts of Merchandise,
                            particularly <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">East India</rs> Goods.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Deane</persName> being asked, how it came to be necessary for him to remain so long on the Coast,
                            as the Woods are cut by the Natives? replied, The Collection of Ivory requires some Time, being
                            collected at different Places on the Coast, which makes it necessary for the Persons in that
                            Branch of the Trade to sailed up and down. <persName>Captain Deane</persName> took in his Cargo of Ivory principally at
                            <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, and the Island of <placeName>Bananas</placeName>; but the manner of carrying on this Trade, as they are
                            obliged to trust their Goods to make the Purchases and to wait for the Return, occasions much
                            Delay. The Goods are sent up into the Country, and it is sometimes several Months before the
                            Returns are made. The Ivory is bought of the Natives, who bring it off to the Ships in small
                            Canoes, and take our Goods in return. On the Part of the Coast where the Ivory is chiefly procured
                            there are not any White Factors residing, but where there are White Factors they collect
                            a little. 
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Deane</persName> being asked, whether he traded at all in Gold Dust? said, He traded in it a
                            little at <placeName>Cape Le Hou</placeName>, buying it of the Natives, who brought it off in small Boxes. Being asked,
                            whether he ever knew, or had heard, in what Manner the Natives collect the Gold Dust? he
                            replied, He did not know with Certainty, but had heard, they collect it at the Foot of the
                            Mountains, and principally under the Water-falls, where it is brought down, mixed with Dirt, by the
                            Violence of the Torrents, The Gold Dust is paid for in Goods, as the Ivory is, and is bought by
                            the Ounce. <persName>Captain Deane</persName> cannot state generally the Price paid for the Gold Dust, by the Price of
                            the Goods paid for it; but being asked, whether he could state the Number of <rs type="properAdjective">Birmingham</rs> Guns
                            given in Exchange for an Ounce of Gold Dust? he replied, A Gun sells for Four Ackies, and
                            Sixteen Ackies go to purchase an Ounce of Gold Dust; so that Four <rs type="properAdjective">Birmingham</rs> Guns, of the
                            better Sort, go to the Purchase of an Ounce of Gold. Being asked the Price at <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> of
                            such a Gun? replied, The Average Value would be about Eleven Shillings and Sixpence. And
                            being asked, what a merchant, in computing the Proceeds of such a Voyage, would charge for
                            Freight and Insurance, so as to find the Value of such a Gun upon the Coast? <persName>Captain Dean</persName>
                            replied, He could not answer with Accuracy, but should suppose, a merchant would add about 
                            Sixpence to the Price of the Gun before mentioned. <persName>Captain Deane</persName> being asked, whether in
                            making up the homeward Cargo, the Captains buy the Goods according to any Assortment prescribed
                            by their Employers, or take them as they are able to meet with them? replied, They
                            take them as they are able to meet with them. And being asked, what he considers as the most
                            valuable Article for a homeward Cargo? He gave the following Enumeration:
                            <list>
                                <item>1st Ivory, which is the great Object of the Voyage.</item>
                                <item>2s. Camwood.</item>
                                <item>3d. Guinea Grains, or Maliguetta Pepper.</item>
                                <item>4th. Rice.</item>
                                <item>And Lastly, Gold Dust.</item>
                            </list>
                            And gave as the Reason why he reckoned Gold Dust the last, that the Slave Ships being obliged 
                            to have a Quantity of it for carrying on their Trade on the <placeName>Leeward Coast</placeName>, give a higher
                            Price for it than those employed in his Branch of Trade can afford, for which Reason the latter
                            get very little of it.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Captain Deane</persName> being asked, What Number of Ships were employed in the Ivory and Wood
                            Trade, as far as he knew, in the Course of the last Two Years? said, He was not sure; but
                            should imagine about Twelve or Fourteen Ships in each Year.

                            <p>By the Laws of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, every Proprietor is obliged to allot one Acre of good Provision
                                Ground to every Four Negroes belonging to him: this is meant for their own private Cultivation:
                                And besides this, the Negroes have in all the Plantations an unbounded Liberty to
                                cultivate as much Land as they please. But as the major Part of them are improvident and
                                negligent, there are few, if any, Estates, the Owners or Managers of which do not keep a
                                large Tract of Ground constantly stocked with some or other of the various vegetable Species,
                                such as <ecda:flora ana="#food">Plantains</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Yams</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Cocoa</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Potatoe</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">Cassavi</ecda:flora>, &amp;c.; and who also take every seasonable

                            <p>In addition to these, every well regulated Estate imports <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Herrings</ecda:food> or Salt Fish, or both
                                <ecda:food>Flour</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>Pease</ecda:food>. Twenty or Twenty-five Barrels of Herrings to every One Hundred Negroes

                            <p>Every industrious Negro breeds <ecda:fauna>Hogs</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>Poultry</ecda:fauna> for his own and Family Use, or for

                                lucrative Commerce, which they carry on uninterruptedly, as well with the King's Ships and
                                Troops on that Station, as with the Shipping in genera. the Towns, and the Country
                                Markets, and Plantations, by which Means these Negro Slaves are possessed of Nine-tenths
                                at least (or nearly the Whole) of the smaller Silver Currency (rials and Pistarins) now in the
                                Island; nor has there existed an Example within our Knowledge, that the Owners of such 
                                Negroes have deprived them of any Part of such their Acquisitions, which by long Practice
                                and Usage are universally considered as their own Property, Right, or <distinct rend="italic">Peculium</distinct>, which they
                                keep or dispose of, and devise at their own Pleasure. And some there are, who are rich
                                enough to purchase their Freedom, if they were of opinion it would render their Condition
                                more comfortable and happy than it is at present.

                            <p>Slaves employed in the Culture of Lands are allowed by their Masters certain Proportions
                                of Land, which they cultivate for their own Support and Maintenance. These Lands are
                                for the most part found equal to support and sustain the Slaves to whom they are respectively
                                allotted; and, excepting the Time of Crop, they are allowed, in general, One Day in every
                                Fortnight (independent of Sundays) for the Purpose of cultivating them. In addition to this,
                                they are, in general, served weekly, or once a Fortnight, with <ecda:food>Herrings</ecda:food>, or other Salt Fish,
                                after the Rate of a Herring or other such Fish per Day: They are also allowed Slat as they
                                have occasion to ask for it. Where Lands cannot be allowed them, or where they are inadequate, 
                                or when they seasons happen to fail, the Master furnishes his Slaves, in general, with
                                <ecda:food>Corn</ecda:food>, at the Rate of about Six Quarts per Week, or an adequate Supply in <ecda:food>Flour</ecda:food>, besides
                                the said usual Supply of Salt Herrings, or other salted Fish: Domestics and Tradesmen, who
                                are employed in and about the Towns, or have no Connexion with Plantations, are in general,
                                if not universally, at Board-wages. The late <title>Consolidated Slave Act</title> furnishes also an

                            <p>The general Clothing in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is what is called Osnaburgh Linen. On every well-
                                regulated Estate, the annual Allowance is from Ten to Twenty Yards to every Man; from
                                Seven to fifteen Yards to every Woman; and in proportion to the younger People. To
                                every Negro, a Worsted Cap, Bonnet, or Hat, besides a Woollen Jacket, or Welch Blanket,
                                to the Men; a Petticoat and Blanket to the Women. The Petticoat is on many Estates
                                of Perptuana; a Quantity of common Check Linen is given on some Estates to the
                                principal Negroes, such as Boilers, Drivers, Waggoners, and Tradesmen; and several of our
                                Planters furnish Handkerchiefs, Knives, Scissars, Thread, Needles, and short Tobacco Pipes.
                                The <rs type="properAdjective">Jamaica</rs> Law enjoins sufficient Clothing to be given, and inflicts a Penalty on such
                                Owners as disobey that Injunction. In general, the Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> are well clothed; and
                                there are very few Sugar Estates where the Negroes do not, from their own private Earnings,
                                provide themselves with extra Clothes for Sundays and Holidays.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Negro Slaves on the Plantations in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, in general (except the calamitous Years),
                                raise more Provisions than they can consume. They carry the Overplus to Market,
                                and commonly lay out the Money they receive for it in Fineries, or in <ecda:commodity>Salt Beef</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Pork</ecda:commodity> or
                                <ecda:commodity>Fish</ecda:commodity>, and sometimes in <ecda:commodity>Spiritous Liquors</ecda:commodity>. Before a Planter makes a Purchase of imported

                                and most Planters also give them a Breed of Hogs and Poultry.

                            <p>The established Negro Slaves lie in Houses perfectly convenient to themselves, and
                                adapted to the Climate; the Size is proportioned to their Rank and Family. When they 
                                require to be rebuilt or enlarged, sufficient Time, Materials, and Assistance are allowed
                                them for those Purposes. Upon the whole, we believe them to be far better clothed, lodged,
                                and fed in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, than the Peasantry of <placeName>Europe</placeName> in general.

                                Frocks, and Two Pair of Osnaburgh Trowsers, with an Hat or Woollen Bonnet to each Man;
                                and to each Woman, Two Shifts and Two Petticoats of Osnaburgh, and a Hat; and to each,
                                whether Man or Woman, a Piece of Woollen Cloth or Blanketing. Drivers, or principal
                                Negroes, are usually allowed a double Proportion of each, with a Check Shirt to the Men of
                                that Description. Domestics and Workmen in and about Towns are clothed as Domestics
                                and Workmen are clothed as in England in the Summer Time.
                            </p>
                            <p>Slaves employed in Husbandry are lodged on the Master's Land, in separate Houses,
                                from about Twenty to Twenty-four Feet in Length, and from Ten to Twelve, or Fourteen
                                broad, and which, if they are themselves unable to erect, their Masters build for them.
                                These Houses are in general thatched, wattled, and plaistered, are found a very sufficient 
                                Protection against the most inclement Seasons, and are for the most Part full as commodious as the
                                Cottages of the labouring Peasantry in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>. Domestics are as well lodged as Domestics

                                Produce of which, together with an Allowance of Herring or other Salt Fish, Sugar and Rum,

                            <p>Till within these Twelve or Fourteen Years, a few Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> were let out to hire,
                                except Domestics and Tradesmen.—But in consequence of some Discouragements which the 
                                Article <ecda:commodity>Coffee</ecda:commodity> met with, most of the Coffee Planters began to let out their working Negroes
                                upon Job Work, on the Sugar Estates.
                            </p>
                            <p>This Business has ever since been followed pretty extensively in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, both by the inferior
                                Settlers, and such Overseers of Sugar-works, who have from time to time become Owners of
                                Negroes, but not yet possessed of Land of their own, or who have not applied themselves to the

                            <p>The Planters have many of them adopted this Practice, both on account of the very advanced
                                Proce of imported Negroes, and from the Principle of easing and assisting their own People
                                in the several Parts of their Annual Labour.

                            <p>We do not know that it is usual in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, with any Planters in tolerable Circumstances, to

                                In the two latter Instances, the Slaves so hired usually remain on the Land where they are

                                on the Plantation.

                                it is not pretended that Negro Slaves are naturally more subject to them than the White
                                Inhabitants or Free Negroes; what Difference is observable between them in this Respect, is 
                                chiefly to be attributed to <emph>Manners</emph>.—Numbers of the Negro Slaves in that Island either
                                perish or are rendered Invalids by Fevers, Fluxes, and Pleurisies, occasioned by their Habit of
                                rambling to what are called <distinct rend="italic">Negro Plays</distinct> or nocturnal Assemblies, in distant Parts, where
                                they dance immoderately, drink to Excess, sleep on the damp Ground in open Air, and
                                commit such Acts of Sensuality and Intemperance, as bring on the most fatal Distempers.
                                No Causes, perhaps, more impede the natural Increase of the Slaves than these; the Women
                                catch Cold; their natural Periods are obstructed; they have Commerce too early in Life, even
                                at the Age of Nine, and with a Multitude of Men; and both Sexes studiously conceal
                                Infection with the venereal Taint, until it becomes almost irremediable. The Negroes, both
                                Men and Women, most studiously endeavour to conceal their Infection with this Disorder,
                                either considering it as reproachful to them, or the Necessity of abstaining from Pleasure 
                                during the medicinal Course as an intolerable Punishment.

                                must be had to local Differences of Situation. The lowest Situations, such as Vallies,
                                and the Banks of Rivers and Lagoons, are the most unhealthy; and in such Situations in
                                general, the Negroes will every be found the most distempered, sickly, and short-lived. The
                                Native Slaves, if industrious and sober, in general attain to the more common Periods of human
                                Life: The Women in general outlive the Men. As great Part of the Sugar Estates are
                                Lowlands, the Whites as well as the Blacks are subject to the same Inconveniencies in point of

                                free in this respect. But every prudent Planter encourages his Negroes to form their Connexions
                                upon his own Estate, as a Means of preventing them from rambling every Night to
                                Other Estates in the Neighbourhood, and of reducing them to a temperate and orderly Habit of
                                Life. The pregnant Woman has easy Work assigned her; at the Time of Parturition she is
                                attended by a Midwife, and for a Month by a careful Nurse, and. if the Case should require it,
                                by medical Assistance: She has also every Indulgence in Food proper for lying-in Women.
                                Few of these Women die of child-bed Fevers, but Multitudes of Infants are carried off by
                                the Tetanus, or locked Jaw. The suckling Women are put to some gentle Work at a proper
                                Distance of Time after their Deliver. Their Infants are laid under Shelter, here they
                                are taken care of by One or more Dry-nurses, and the Mother comes frequently to give them
                                the Breast. Such as are Nurses have an extra Allowance out of the Stores. When the Children
                                are able to run about, they are usually brought up every Day at Noon to the Overseer's
                                House, to be served with Messes of Broth provided for them; and many are brought up in
                                Families, during Infancy, in the same Manner as White Children.

                                and Relations, through a strong Family Attachment that generally prevails amongst them, furnish

                            </p>
                            <p>As far as we are able to decide from our own Experience and Information when we lived
                                in the Island, and from the concurrent Testimony of all the Negroes we have ever conversed
                                with on the Subject, the Professors of <distinct rend="italic">Obi</distinct> are, and always were, Natives of <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
                                and none other, and they have brought the Science with them from thence to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>,
                                where it is so universally practiced, that we believe there are few of the larger Estates possessing
                                those who usually attract the greatest Devotion and Confidence, those whose hoary Heads,
                                and a somewhat peculiarly harsh and diabolic in their Aspect, together with some Skill in
                                Plants of the medicinal and poisonous Species, have qualified them for successful imposition
                                upon the weak and credulous. The Negroes in general, whether <placeName>Africans</placeName> or <placeName>Creoles</placeName>, revere,
                                consult, and abhor them; to these Oracles they resort, and with the most implicit Faith, upon
                                all occasions, whether for the Cure of Disorders, and the obtaining Revenge for the Injuries or
                                Insults, the Conciliating of Favour, the Discovery and Punishment of the Thief or the
                                Adulterer, and the Prediction of future Events. The Trade with these Wretches carry on
                                at different Prices. A Veil of Mystery is studiously thrown over their Incantations, to
                                which the Midnight Hours are allotted, and every Precaution is taken to conceal them from
                                the Knowledge and Discovery of the White People. The deluded Negroes, who thoroughly
                                believe in their supernatural Power, become the willing Accomplices in this Concealment,
                                and the stoutest among them tremble at the very Sight of the ragged Bundle, the Bottle or
                                the Egg-shells, which are stuck in the Thatch or hung over the Door of a Hut, or upon the
                                Branch of a Plantain Tree, to deter Marauders. In Cases of Poison, the natural Effects of
                                it are by the ignorant Negroes ascribed entirely to the potent workings of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>. The
                                wiser Negroes hesitate to reveal their Suspicions, through a Dread of incurring the terrible
                                Vengeance which is fulminated by the <name rend="italic">Obiah-men</name> against any who should betray them; it is
                                very difficult therefore for the White Proprietor to distinguish the <distinct rend="italic">Obia Possessor</distinct> from any
                                other Negro upon his Plantation; and so infatuated are the Blacks in general, that but few
                                Instances occur of their having assumed Courage enough to impeach these Miscreants. With
                                Minds so firmly prepossessed, they no sooner find <name rend="italic">Obi</name> <emph>set for them</emph> near the Door of their
                                House, or in the Path which leads to it, than they give themselves up for lost. When a
                                Negro is robbed of a Fowl or a Hog, he applies directly to the <rs type="properAdjective">Obiah</rs>-Man or Woman; it
                                is then made known among his Fellow Blacks, that <distinct rend="italic"><name>Obi</name> is set</distinct> for the Thief; and as soon as
                                the latter hears the dreadful News, his terrified Imagination begins to work, no Resource is
                                left but in the superior Skill of some more eminent <name rend="italic">Obiah-Man</name> of the Neighbourhood,
                                who may counteract the magical Operations of the other; but if no one can be found
                                of higher Rank and Ability, or if after gaining such an Ally he should still fancy himself
                                affected, he presently falls into a Decline, under the incessant Horror of impending Calamities.
                                The slightest painful Sensation in the Head, the Bowels, or any other Part, any
                                casual Loss or Hurt, confirms his apprehensions, and he believes himself the devoted 
                                Victim of an invisible and irresistible Agency. Sleep, Appetite, and Cheerfulness, forsake
                                him, his Strength decays, his disturbed Imagination is haunted without Respite, his Features
                                wear the settled Gloom of Despondency; Dirt, or any other unwholesome Substance, becomes
                                his only Food, he contracts morbid Habit of the Body, and gradually sinks into the Grave.
                                A Negro, who is taken ill, enquires of the <name rend="italic">Obiah-man</name> the Cause of his Sickness, whether
                                it will prove mortal or not, and within what Time he shall die or recover? The Oracle
                                generally ascribes the Distemper to the Malice of some particular Person by Name, and
                                advises to set <name rend="italic">Obi</name> for that Person; but if no Hopes are given of Recovery, immediate
                                Despair takes place, which no Medicine can remove, and Death is the certain Consequence.
                                Those anomalous Symptoms, which originate from Causes deeply rooted in the Mind, such
                                as the Terrors of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>, or from Poisons, whose Operation is slow and intricate, will baffle
                                the Skill of the ablest Physician.
                            </p>
                            <p>Considering the Multitude of Occasions which may provoke the Negroes to exercise the
                                Power of <name rend="italic">Obi</name> against each other, and the astonishing Influence of this Superstition upon their
                                Minds, we cannot but attribute a very considerable Portion of the annual Mortality among
                                the Negroes of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> to this fascinating Mischief.

                            <p>The <name rend="italic">Obi</name> is usually composed of a Farrago of Materials, most of which are enumerated in
                                the <rs type="properAdjective">Jamaica</rs> Law <seg xml:id="a03ish" corresp="#n03ish">(a)</seg>, viz. <quote rend="quotes">Blood, Feathers, Parrots Beaks, Dogs Teeth, Alligators

                            </p>
                            <p>With a view to illustrate the Description we have given of this Practice and its common
                                Effects, we have subjoined a few Examples out of the very great Number which have occurred
                                in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; not that they are peculiar to that Island only, for we believe similar Examples
                                may be found in other <rs type="properAdjective">West India</rs> Colonies. <persName rend="italic">Pere Labat</persName>, in his <title>History of <placeName>Martinico</placeName></title>, has
                                mentioned some which are very remarkable <seg xml:id="a04ish" corresp="#n04ish">(b)</seg>.
                            </p>
                            <p>It may seem extraordinary, that a Practice alleged to be so frequent in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> should not
                                have received an early Check from the Legislature. The Truth is, that the Skill of some
                                Negroes in the Art of Poisoning has been noticed ever since the Colonists became much
                                acquainted with them. <persName>Sloane</persName> and <persName>Barham</persName>, who practised Physic in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the last Century, 
                                have mentioned particular instances of it. The secret and insidious Manner in which
                                this Crime is generally perpetuated, makes the legal Proof of it extremely difficult. Suspicions
                                therefore have been frequent, but Detections rare: These Murderers have <emph>sometimes</emph>
                                been brought to Justice, but it is reasonable to believe that a far greater Number have
                                escaped with Impunity. In regard to the other and more common Tricks of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>, such as
                                hanging up Feathers, Bottles Eggshells, &amp;c. &amp;c. in order to intimidate Negroes of a thievish
                                Disposition from plundering Huts, Hog-styes, or Provision Grounds, these were laughed at by
                                the White Inhabitants as harmless Stratagems, contrived by the more sagacious for deterring
                                the more simple and superstitious Blacks, and serving for much the same Purpose as the
                                Scarecrows, which are in general used among our <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Farmers and Gardeners. But in the
                                Year <date when="1760">1760</date>, when a very formidable Insurrection of the <rs type="properAdjective">Cormantin</rs> or <rs type="properAdjective">Gold Coast</rs> Negroes
                                broke out in the <placeName>Parish of St. Mary</placeName>, and spread through almost every other District of the 
                                Parish, who had administered the Fetish or solemn Oath to the Conspirators, and furnished 
                                them with a magical Preparation which was to render them invulnerable, was fortunately 
                                apprehended, convicted, and hung up with all his Feathers and Trumperies about him and
                                this Execution struck the Insurgents with a general Panic, from which they never afterwards
                                recovered. The Examinations which were taken at that period first opened the Eyes of
                                this Law, the strict Investigation which ever since been made after the Professors of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>,
                                nor the many Examples of those who from Time to Time have been hanged or transported,

                                    <p>Upon returning to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the Year <date when="1775">1775</date>, he found a great many of his Negroes had died
                                        during his Absence; and that of such as remained alive, at least One-half were debilitated,
                                        bloated, and in a very deplorable Condition. The Mortality continued after his Arrival, and
                                        Two or Three were frequently buried in One Day; others were taken ill, and began to decline
                                        under the same Symptoms. Every Means were tried by Medicines, and the most
                                        careful Nursing, to preserve the Lives of the feebles; but in spite of all his Endeavours,
                                        this Depopulation went on for above a Twelvemonth longer, with more or less Intermission,
                                        and without his being able to ascertain the real Cause, though the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct> was strongly
                                        suspected, as well by himself, as by <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="doctor" a-arc="white">the Doctor</ecda:anonPers> and other White Persons upon the Plantation,
                                        as it was known to have been very common in that Part of the Island, and particularly among the
                                        Negroes of the <placeName rend="italic">Pawpaw</placeName> of <placeName rend="italic">Popo</placeName> Country. Still he was unable to verify his Suspicions, because
                                        the Patients constantly denied their having any Thing to do with Persons of that Order, or
                                        any Knowledge of them. At length <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-arc="negress" a-status="enslaved">a Negress</ecda:anonPers>, who had been ill for some Time, came one
                                        Day and informed him, that feeling it was impossible for her to live much longer, she thought
                                        herself bound in Duty, before she died, to impart a very great Secret, and acquaint him
                                        with the true Cause of her Disorder, in hopes that the Disclosure might prove the Means
                                        of stopping that Mischief which had already swept away a Number of her Fellow-slaves.

                                        who had lately died; and that the old Woman had practised <name rend="italic">Obi</name> for as many Years past
                                        as she could remember.

                                    <p>The other Negroes of the Plantation no sooner heard of this Impeachment, than they ran
                                        in a Body to their Master, and confirmed the Truth of it, adding, that she had carried on
                                        this Business ever since her Arrival from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and was the Terror of the whole Neighbourhood.—
                                        Upon this he repaired directly with <ecda:persGroup a-arc="white" a-occupation="servants">Six White Servants</ecda:persGroup> to the old Woman's House,
                                        and forcing open the Door, observed the whole inside of the Roof (which was Thatch),
                                        and every Crevice of the Walls, stuck with the Implements of her trade, consisting of Rags,
                                        Feathers, Bones of Cats, and a thousand other Articles. Examining further, a large earthen
                                        Pot or Jar, close covered, was found concealed under the Bed.—It contained a prodigious
                                        quantity of round Balls of Earth or Clay of various Dimensions, large and small, whitened
                                        on the Outside, and variously compounded, some with Hair and Rags or Feathers of all Sorts,
                                        and strongly bound with Twine; others Blended with the upper Section of the Skulls of Cats,
                                        or stuck round with Cats Teeth and Claws, or with Human or Dogs Teeth, and some Glass
                                        Beads of different Colours; there were also a great many Eggshells filled with a viscous or
                                        gummy Substance, the Qualities of which he neglected to examine, and many little Bags
                                        stuffed with a variety of Articles, the Particulars of which cannot at this Distance of Time
                                        be recollected. The House was instantly pulled down, and with the whole of its Contents 
                                        committed to Flames, amidst the general Acclamations of all his other Negroes. In regard
                                        to the old Woman, he declined bringing her to Trial under the Law of the Island, which
                                        would have punished her with Death; but from a Principle of Humanity, delivered her into
                                        the Hands of a Party of <name>Spaniards</name>, who (as she was thought not incapable of doing some
                                        trifling Kind of Work) were very glad to accept and carry her with them to <placeName>Cuba</placeName>. From the 
                                        Moment of her Departure, his Negroes seemed all to be animated with new Spirits, and the
                                        Malady spread no farther among them. The Total of his Losses in the course of about Fifteen
                                        Years preceding the Discover, and imputable solely to the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct>, he estimates
                                        at the least, at One Hundred Negroes.

                                        turned about in a very great Fright, and refused to proceed; his Master, surprised at all this,

                                <p><name>Obeah-men</name> are the oldest and most artful Negroes; a Peculiarity marks them, and every
                                    Negro pays the greatest Respect to them, they are perfectly well acquainted with medicinal
                                    Herbs, and know the poisonous ones, which they often use. To prepossess the Stranger in
                                    favour of their Skill, he is told that they can restore the Dead to Life; for this Purpose he
                                    is shewn a Negro apparently dead, who, by Dint of their Art, soon recovers; this is produced 
                                    by administering the narcotic Juice of Vegetables. On searching one of the <name>Obeah-men's</name>
                                    Houses, was found many Bags filled with parts of Animals, Vegetables, and Earth, which
                                    the Negroes who attended at the Sight of, were struck with Terror, and begged that they
                                    might be christened, which was done, and the Impression was done away. In consequence 
                                    of the Rebellion of the Negroes in the Year <date when="1760">1760</date>, a Law was enacted that Year to render the
                                    Practice of <name>Obiah</name>, Death.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Influence of the Professors of that Art was such as to induce many to enter into that
                                    Rebellion on the Assurance that they were to be invulnerable, and to render them so, the
                                    <name>Obeah-men</name> gave them a Powder with which they were to rub themselves.

                                <p>On the First Engagement with the Rebels Nine of them were killed, and many Prisoners
                                    taken: Among the Prisoners was <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">a very sensible Fellow</ecda:anonPers>, who offered to discover many 
                                    important Matters, on the condition that his Life should be spared, which was promised. He then
                                    related the Part the <name>Obeah-men</name> had taken, <ecda:anonPers a-religion="obeah" a-gender="male">One of whom was capitally convicted and 
                                    sentenced to Death</ecda:anonPers>.

                                    in the Power of White People to kill him; and the <rs type="properAdjective">Negro</rs> Spectators were astonished when
                                    they saw him expire. On the other <name>Obeah-men</name>, various Experiments were made with Exectrical
                                    Machines and Magic Lanthorns, which produced very little Effect; except on one who,
                                    after receiving many severe Shocks, acknowledged his Master's <name>Obeah</name> exceeded his own.

                                        Well from which the Family had their daily Supply, was observed to be very much discoloured, 
                                        and intolerably fetid. His Master, imagining these might be the natural Effects of
                                        Stagnation, ordered the Well to be drawn till it was supposed to be nearly drained. But 
                                        notwithstanding this Operation, the Water still continued ill-coloured, nauseous to the Taste,
                                        and offensive to the Smell. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">A Man</ecda:anonPers> was then let down, who brought up a <distinct rend="italic">white Fowl</distinct> in a

                                        very putrid State, without Beak or Claws, which had all been cut off. This Fowl was
                                        proved to have belonged to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-religion="obi">the Butler's Grandmother</ecda:anonPers>, residing upon or near the same Plantation.
                                        On further Examination, a large Quantity of <distinct rend="italic">Indigo Seed</distinct> was fished up from the
                                        Bottom of the Well. These Circumstances occasioned Suspicions of some Mischievous Design.
                                        The Houses of all the Negroes were Searched, and at one of them, inhabited by a
                                        near Relation of the Butler, a <distinct rend="italic">Calibash</distinct> or Bowl was found, out of which a <distinct rend="italic">greenish Liquid</distinct>
                                        had been recently emptied. This Circumstance brought to mind, that a Phial containing a
                                        Liquid of similar Appearance, had been noticed in the Butler's Pantry, who, upon the first
                                        Rumour of a Search, had conveyed it away. Still it was undecided upon whom the Suspicion
                                        ought to fall, till the Cook came voluntarily to his Master (apprehensive for his own
                                        Safety, if Poison should be privately thrown into any of his Dishes), and gave positive

                                        Transportation. The Rectitude of his Sentence was confirmed by the Man's free Confession
                                        immediately before he was put on board Ship.

                                        Plantation. This Woman fell suddenly into a Decline, without any known Cause, and languishing
                                        for some Time, contracted at length a very morbid Habit of Body. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="doctor">The Doctor who
                                        attended her</ecda:anonPers>, and tried a Variety of Medicens without any good Effect, declared it beyond
                                        his Power to afford her any Relief, and pronounced her incurable. When her Death was
                                        every Day expected, and after much Importunity to discover the Cause of her Disorder, she 
                                        was prevailed on to confess that her Husband, from a violent Suspicion of her Infidelity to
                                        him, and on her sturdy Denial of the Charge, had obliged her <quote rend="quotes">to take Swear</quote> (as she
                                        called it), by drinking a Mixture of <distinct rend="italic">Grave Dirt</distinct> and <distinct rend="italic">water</distinct>, accompanied by the usual
                                        Imprecation (that her Belly might swell and burst, and her Bones rot, if she was guilty). She
                                        concluded with deploring the miserable End to which she had brought herself by denying the 
                                        Fact, for that she really had been false to him. Intelligence of this Confession was given to
                                        <ecda:anonPers>her Husband's Master</ecda:anonPers>, who sent immediately for him, and representing the Perin in which he
                                        stood under the Law of the Land, which had declared the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct>, with <distinct rend="italic">Grave Dirt</distinct>,
                                        a capital Offence, advised him to go directly to his Wife, and endeavour to cajole her into a
                                        Belief, that it was nothing more than a sly Contrivance of his own to get at the truth: That
                                        the Mixture she had swallowed was not made with <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Dirt</distinct>, but only with a little common
                                        Earth, which he had picked up on the rad, and therefore it was very harmless. The Fellow
                                        (who had owned the Fact to his Master) joyfully took his Advice, and acted his Part so
                                        well , that the poor Woman was completely duped a second Time, and recovering her Spirits,
                                        was soon restored to perfect Health.

                                    <p>If this Woman had died, the Evidence of her Declaration would not have been deemed

                                        his own free Confession of the Fact, he would have escaped with Impunity. The singular
                                        Test of her Continence (it may be remarked by the way) so closely resembles the <title rend="italic">Trial of

                                <p>Assurance was given to these deluded People, that they were to become invulnerable; and

                            <p>What Difference is there in the Produce per Acre of different Plantations in the same
                                Year, when not exposed to any extraordinary Accident?
                            </p>
                            <p>In answering this Inquiry, several general Observations must be premised in reference to
                                <placeName rend="italic">Jamaica</placeName>.
                            </p>
                            <p>1st. The Difference of Product so far as depends on unequal Supply of Rains.</p>
                            <p>The Two grand periods of the Year, when the rainy Seasons (or great Rains) are
                                commonly expected, are May and October; and when those Supplies arrive with Regularity (but
                                of late Years the May Season has too frequently failed) the Distribution of Rain, though not
                                equal in all Parts of the Island, is yet universal; but between these Two Periods, a due
                                Frequency of Showers is requisite for each Sugar Estate, in order to sustain Vegetation, and these
                                are very unequally bestowed, depending not only on the Direction in which the Mountains
                                and Hills are ranged, but on the Point from which the Wind may happen to blow; and on
                                the Extent of the Clouds; for it very often happens that an Estate from its particular 
                                Situation, receives Showers for several Days, when the next adjoining Estate, from its
                                Difference in Position in respect to the High-lands, Winds, &amp;c. does not get a Drop.
                            </p>
                            <p>2dly, is to be considered the essential Difference which arises from the difference of Skill and
                                Attention in manuring, planting, weeding, moulding, and the general Operations in
                                this Respect, as well as in the other manufacturing Process, by which the greatest possible
                                Quantity of Sugar is to be extracted.
                            </p>
                            <p>These Considerations being premised, the rest must depend upon the Quality of Soils,
                                which, in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, are various in each District at large, and almost equally so on the major 
                                Part of the Estates themselves. We believe that the Average Produce, One Year with another,
                                of the whole Island does not amount to much more than Half an Hogshead of Sugar per
                                Acre; particular Spots may yield much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Inquiry perhaps ought, for greater Satisfaction, to be directed to such Gentlemen
                                as are now residing in the Island.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Difference of Produce per Acre on different Plantations is very great; much in
                                this Respect depends on the Difference not only of Soil but Mode of Management.

                            <p>By what Causes are Crops on different parts of the same Island partially affected?</p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, by partial Rains, partial Droughts, Floods, and Hurricanes, the Blast and
                                Rats, not to mention the great Disparity occasioned by more or less Skill in Management,
                                or by the healthy or unhealthy state of the Labourers, or their Adequacy or inadequacy in
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                point of Number to the present Crop, because seasonable or unseasonable Weather will
                                increase or diminish the Crop, and the Labour necessary to take it off.
                            </p>
                            <p>It frequently happens, that some Parts of this Island are materially injured by Droughts,
                                strong Winds, and other Causes, while other Parts experience very seasonable Weather.

                            <p>Does the Quantity of labour, which is necessary to require from the Negroes, vary
                                materially in different Parts of the Year, as it does here in Harvest Time, &amp;c. and is there
                                any Period at which the increased Labour produces any particular Effect on the Health of
                                the Negroes?
                            </p>
                            <p>The System of Sugar-making must be considered in its progressive State, as calling for
                                successive operations throughout the Year, as
                                <list>
                                    <item>1st Ploughing.</item>
                                    <item>2d. Holing, manuring, and trenching.</item>
                                    <item>3d. Moulding, weeding, and trashing.</item>
                                    <item>4th. Cutting, grinding, boiling, and curing.</item>
                                    <item>5th. Carting to the Shipping-place.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>Of these several Operations, that of holing and planting is by no means the most laborious;
                                but as it is often unavoidably obliged to be performed in showery Weather, the Negroes, if
                                too much exposed to it, may be liable to obstructed Perspiration and Fevers; but most of the 
                                Planters have moveable Tents or Sheds, which are set up in the Fields, for the Purpose of
                                protecting them from the Effects of heavy Showers.
                            </p>
                            <p>In point of Labour, the Fourth Operation is so far from being oppressive or injurious to
                                the Negroes, that they enjoy better Health in general during the Crop Season (which lasts
                                about Five Months) than at any other Time: This may in Part be ascribed to their free Use
                                of the Cane Liquor (resembling Sweet Wort) and the more settled or drier weather during
                                that Season of the Year.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Work of the Negro Slave in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is far less than that of a Labourer in <placeName>Britain</placeName>;
                                they have in general 15 Hours in 24 to themselves, which is quite sufficient for Sleep, and for
                                cooking and eating their Victuals, to say nothing of Recreations.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Labour of Slaves varies much at different Seasons of the Year: Digging Cane
                                Holes is Considered as the hardest Labour; so long, however as the Slaves continue at that
                                Work, they are regularly served in the Field with Beverage of Sugar and Water in the
                                Morning, and Rum and Water in the Afternoon. Crop-time (our Harvest) may be deemed
                                hard Labour, as the Work in the Boiling-house is continued Day and Night; but the
                                Slaves do not so consider it; and indeed, by the free Access they are allowed to the
                                Liquor in the Boiling-house, in the course of its Manufacture into Sugar, the Slaves 
                                universally thrive.

                            <p>Would it be possible to cultivate to Advantage the <placeName>West India Islands</placeName>, by the Labour of 
                                <name>Europeans</name>, or of Free Negroes?
                            </p>
                            <p>We think it impossible with <name>Europeans</name>: So far as Experience can determine, we find that
                                the same Exposure to the Sun, which cheers the <name>African</name>, is mortal to the <name>European</name>; Nine in

                            <p>As to Free Negroes;—in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> no Free Negro was ever yet known to hire himself, or be
                                employed in Agriculture upon the Sugar Plantations: The Men are averse to labour the
                                Ground even for themselves; and whenever they do it, it is only to supply their immediate
                                Wants: They have all the Vices of Slaves, and no Planter could controul them.

                            <p>What is the Disposition of the Free Negroes with respect to Labour, particularly continual
                                or diurnal Labour?
                            </p>
                            <p>We can only repeat what we have before said—that no Free Negro in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> was every yet
                                known to hire himself, or be employed in Agriculture of any Kind.

                            <p>Vide their Answer, Nº 37.</p>
                            <p>The Negroes are universally disposed to be slothful and indolent; they are in general no
                                longer disposed to work than while they find it necessary to do so for immediate Subsistence;
                                there are however some Exceptions.

                            <p>Could an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Constitution subsist in a <placeName type="properAdjective">West India</placeName> Climate, under the Labour necessary

                            </p>
                            <p>We have every Reason to believe it would not: The Nature and Constitution of an <name>European</name>
                                are not so well adapted to retain even Life, much less to support Field Labour, either in the

                            <p>Is the Labour of Cattle, and of what Species and in what Proportion, used in the Cultivation
                                of a <placeName type="properAdjective">West India</placeName> Plantation?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, Oxen in general are used in ploughing, where ploughing is practicable; some
                                (but they are few) make use of Horses for the same Purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>Mules are chiefly used for Carriage on steep Acclivities and bad Roads; in other Places the
                                Carriages are drawn by Oxen.—The Mills are turned by Wind, Water, Mules, Oxen, or
                                Horses.
                            </p>
                            <p>Horned Cattle are used on many Sugar-works, in Ploughing and harrowing the Land;
                                and on all, the Cattle and Mules are used in carrying the Canes to the Mill, Manure to the
                                ground, Copper-wood to the Works, and any other Draught-labour where they can possibly
                                be applied: The Labour of Slaves is, however, absolutely necessary, after the Plough, to 
                                prepare the Land for the Plant.

                            <p>Could the Quantity of Cattle be increased, and could their Labour be substituted for that of
                                Slaves in a greater Extent than it is at present?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> the Quantity of Cattle is daily increasing, and may certainly be increased
                                very considerably, by continuing to open and settle new Breeding Farms: How far the Assistance
                                of Cattle, in the Cane and other Culture, can be extended beyond what is at present, may
                                depend on a Variety of Circumstances, best learnt, by inquiring on the Spot; for it is 
                                presumed, that there are some thousands of Acres new in Culture, which, from their rocky and 
                                inaccessible Nature, cannot be worked by the Plough; and many more thousand Acres yet
                                in the Wilderness, on which, when Cleared, the Plough may probably be usefully employed:
                                Cattle, we believe, are already employed in all the Operations of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jamaica</rs> husbandry to
                                which their Assistance is applicable.
                            </p>
                            <p>There is a Sufficiency of Cattle in this Island for Work, and also for the Butcher, and
                                considerably more than could be maintained but for the Introduction of <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> Grass.
                            </p>
                            <p>No Negro-labour is applied, when it is possible to substitute the Labour of Cattle or 
                                Mules.

                                in the Cultivation of Plantations in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and is it likely that the Use of them

                                and as the Plough is coming daily into more general Use, the Labour of the Slave is likely to
                                be considerably lightened thereby.

                            <p>No later Survey of the whole Island has been made that we know of; the Surveyors above
                                mentioned were employed at a Period when the interior Country was one vast Wilderness,
                                without Roads, and underexplored; Error was probably unavoidable, and there is not a
                                Doubt at present, but that their Computation was greatly exaggerated; nor can we say more
                                in favour of subsequent Accounts, than that they are to be considered as mere Opinions of
                                Individuals, unfounded upon geometrical Process; that Island therefore has been lengthened
                                or contracted in its Dimensions, at various Times, by the Caprice of different Authors, as
                                a few out of a great many Examples will shew, viz.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the various Accounts we have of the Dimensions of this Island, there appears a Difference
                                of no less than 40 Miles in Length and 20 in the Breadth; nor have the astronomical
                                Observations, taken at different Periods, been more fortunate in adjusting the Longitude of
                                the Eastern and Western Extremities, for they make a Difference amounting to One Degree in
                                the former and 57 Minutes in the latter.

                            <p>In regard to the Latitude of Port royal, there are no less than Seven different fixings,
                                making a variance of 20 Minutes in the Position of that Town; so that until some Principle
                                for accurate Computation can be obtained, no positive Exactness is to be hoped for.

                                allows 160,000 Acres for the Cane Land; but it is certain that from this Mode of Statement,

                                Products increased; but as this Question, and the Two succeeding ones, lead into a very
                                minute Investigation and Detail; we are sensible, were we to offer vague Conjecture,
                                instead of substantial Information, it would be very unsatisfactory; and we have only to lament
                                our Want of sufficient Lights to guide us in such multifarious Inquiries, which we think may
                                be made in the Island itself with better Success.

                                to answer them with Accuracy. It is supposed the whole Number of Acres in this Island
                                is about 3,500,000, of which One-fifth may be in Cultivation; and Three-fifths of the

                            <p>The Plough has been used upon a great many Plantations, for the Purpose of preparing the
                                Land; but it is not possible to say on how many, with Precision, as the Use of the Plough
                                has been, and is now, increasing daily, as has been already said in the Answer to the 42d Quære of

                                were 166,914 Negroes, in the whole of which, about 67,852 Negroes were employed in the

                                99,002 Negroes in that of <ecda:commodity>Sugar</ecda:commodity>: The whole Number of Estates at that Time was 648, and
                                the Quantity of Sugar made 68, 160 Hogsheads, or thereabouts. It is supposed there are at
                                this Time nearly 250,000 Negroes in this Island, which are employed in the various Articles
                                above mentioned, nearly the same Proportion as in the Year <date when="1768">1768</date>. There are now about
                                1060 Sugar Estates, and the Quantity of Sugars now made is supposed to be 100,000 Hogsheads;
                                other Products are supposed to have increased in Proportion.

                            <p>Is the Corn, Grass, or Ground Provisions, raised in the Island of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, produced from
                                separate Farms, or from Lands annexed to the Plantations respectively, and worked by the
                                Negroes belonging to the said Plantations?
                            </p>
                            <p>Almost every Sugar Plantation in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> (or with very few Exceptions) has Plantains,
                                Ground Provisions of various Species, and <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> Grass, cultivated on its contiguous Lands;
                                and no Opportunity of seasonable Weather is neglected, of sowing <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> Corn,
                                and some or other of the various Species of Pulse, as well as on the contiguous Lands, as in the
                                Intervals between the Rows of young Cane Plants. Those Estates which are situated in Parts of
                                the Island too dry for these Purposed, have usually a Provision Settlement in the adjacent hilly
                                or mountainous Parts, where Showers are more frequent.
                            </p>
                            <p>There are in every Parish Polinckes, or little Settlements appropriated to the Cultivation of
                                different Kinds of vegetable Provision, and where Hogs and Poultry are bred for Sale either in
                                the Towns or the Sugar Estates.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Parishes of <placeName>Vere</placeName>, <placeName>St. Elizabeth</placeName>, and <placeName>St. Dorothy</placeName>, the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">Guinea</rs> Corn are cultivated
                                chiefly by the Cotton-growers, on a more extensive Scale, those Districts being remarkably
                                favourable to them. The principal grazing and breeding Farms are chiefly situated among the 
                                midland Mountains, where the Soil and Weather are most suitable to that Branch of Business;
                                there are also many large breeding and grazing Farms, or Penns, in the Lowland Savannahs,
                                neither those nor the former being adapted to Canes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Corn and Ground Provisions are produced from separate Farms, by Farmers who raise such
                                for Sale; grass also is grown upon separate Grounds, called Penns, where great Quantities of 
                                Cattle, Horses, and Mules, are raised, and from whence the Planters provide themselves with
                                Working Stock; Corn, Grass, and Ground Provisions, are also raised on Land annexed to, and
                                worked with the Negroes belonging to Plantations.

                            <p>The making of sufficient Manure every Year is a very important Article of Husbandry in

                            </p>
                            <p>The same Sort of Manure is made use of here as in <placeName>England</placeName>, except Lime; but the most
                                general Way of manuring is, to pen or fold the Cattle upon such Lands as are meant to be
                                replanted.

                            <p>If in general the Planters were to employ Mules and Cattle in carrying out the Manure,
                                would it not be for the Advantage both of the Negroes and the Owners?
                            </p>
                            <p>On the <sic>the</sic> Sugar Estates in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, we believe that the Manure is invariably carted out to
                                all the accessible Lands, and the Steeps are usually dressed by means of the moveable Cattle-
                                penns described in the preceding Answer. We do not know of any Sugar Estate in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>,
                                where the Practice exists of carrying or laying on Manure in any other Manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Manure was never carried in this Island in any other Way than by Cattle and Mules.</p>

                            <p>Upon any Plantation with a given Stock of Negroes, and yielding on an Average a certain
                                annual Quantity of Sugar, what may be supposed to be the net Income to the Owner, if living
                                on the Island, after deducting the Charge of maintaining and clothing his Negroes, the
                                Wear and Year, and other necessary Expences? And what the net Income to the Owner
                                living in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, the Expences and Profits of a Sugar Plantation depend on the local Situation,
                                the Distance of Carriage to and from the Market or Shipping-place, the Goodness or Badness
                                of the Orads; the comparative Advantages of a Windmill, Watermill, or Cattlemill; the
                                Facility of procuring Wood, or the heavy Charges of importing Coals for Fuel; the Labour
                                required upon the Estate, the knowing how to direct and apply that Labour to the best Effect,
                                and to preserve the Labourers and their Offspring, and the Cattle, in the fullest Health and Vigour;
                                the Fecundity of the Soil; the Skill of the Planter; in the best-adapted Husbandry; in preparing
                                the raw Material, and in working it up; the Credit and Independence of the Planter, whereby he is
                                enabled to purchase, with more or less Advantage, the requisite Supplies for the carrying on
                                and Support of his Plantation; the Sagacity and Judgment of the Planter in choosing the
                                most eligible Factor for the Sale of his Produce. Such a Diversity in Talents, Circumstances,
                                and Management of each Estate, make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to answer the
                                first Part of this Question. As to the rest, the Planter who does not reside in the Island,
                                differs from the resident Planter only by having more Deficiency Tax to pay, which is proportioned
                                to the Size of his Family, and a Commission to the Person who has care of the Property
                                during such Absence, both of which operate upon the non-resident Planter as an Absentee
                                Tax.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is apprehended, that upon an Average throughout the Island, the Planter does not make
                                more than Four per Cent. upon his Capital.

                            <p>The House went into a Committee on the <title>Consolidated Slave Bill</title>, and continued to sit
                                upwards of Three Hours. We understand, that by this Bill, the whole System of the Law
                                respecting Negroes is intirely changed. A Council of Protection is established in each Parish;
                                and many humane Provisions are introduced, for rendering their Condition as easy and happy as
                                possible. It is also made Felony, without Benefit of Clergy, to murder a Slave: A Clause
                                which, to the great Honour of the House, passed without a single dissenting Voice.

                            <p>It has been asserted with Confidence that <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName> was cultivated by White People.
                                I have my Doubts about it.

                            <p>An <rs type="place">English</rs> Ship was drove into that Island by Accident.</p>
                            <p>The <persName>Earl of <placeName>Carlisle</placeName>'s</persName> Patent passed.</p>
                            <p>Twenty Years afterwards Richard Ligon arrived there. He found that Sugar-making was
                                then but newly practised; and that whilst he lived in the Island there were reckoned in it
                                about 50,000 Souls, not including the Negroes, who were thought to amount to more than
                                double the Number of Christians. He arrived in <date when="1647-09">September 1647</date>; the Inhabitants were at
                                this time so grievously afflicted with a pestilential Disorder, viz. the Yellow Fever, that before
                                a Month was expired after his Arrival, the living were hardly able to bury the dead. He spent
                                about Three Years in the Island, he was advised, upon Enquiry, to purchase a plantation
                                ready stocked with Servants, Slaves, Horses, Cattle, &amp;c. Colonel Modiford, who was a 
                                Passenger in Ligon's Ship, immediately treated with Major William Hilliard for Purchase of his

                            <p>From the above Account I am unavoidably led to conclude, that 200 Acres in Canes could
                                not be cultivated by 28 White Servants; and finding that there were 96 Negro Slaves upon it
                                at the same Time, and that this was only at 23 Years at most after our first setting foot upon
                                that Island, it seems perfectly clear to me that the Island of <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName> was cultivated by Negro
                                Slaves, and not by White People, as it has been asserted (I think) without Foundation.

                            <p>Your Committee appointed to examine into, and report to the House, the various Allegations
                                and Charges, which, by the Letters of our Agent, and the Minutes of the <orgName>House of Commons</orgName>
                                of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, appear to be contained in a great Number of Petitions presented to that
                                Honourable House on the Subject of the Slave Trade, and the Treatment of the Negroes in this
                                and the rest of his Majesty's Sugar Colonies; to report the Proceedings and Resolutions of the
                                <orgName>British Parliament</orgName> thereon; and further, to consider whether it may be proper of the House to
                                adopt any, and what Measures on this important Occasion, and to report their Opinion thereon
                                to the House; do report,
                            </p>
                            <p>That it appears to your Committee, from the Minutes of the <orgName>British House of Commons</orgName>,
                                that Petitions have been presented from different Corporations, and respectable Bodies of Men
                                in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, praying the Interposition of <orgName>Parliament</orgName> in abolishing the Slave Trade; wherein
                                may of the said Petitioners, not content with stating the various Abuses in the Transportation of
                                Negroes from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, have ventured to bring forward many general unqualified Allegations, in 
                                respect of the Condition and Treatment of Slaves employed in the Cultivation of this, and
                                others of his Majesty's Colonies in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; charging, that the People so employed are
                                either exposed to the arbitrary Will of avaricious and unfeeling Task-masters, without any Protection
                                or means of Redress, even in the Cases of the most atrocious Injury, or placed under the 
                                Dominion of a most merciless and tyrannical System of Laws; that these Laws are executed
                                with Rigour and Brutality; that our Slaves are destroyed in a few Years by long and painful
                                Labour, and a Want of the common Necessaries of Life; and that the Result of such Treatment 
                                is, that our Slaves decrease, instead of increasing, in a Climate perfectly congenial to their
                                own.
                            </p>
                            <p>And it further appears to your Committee, That, in consequence of such Petitions, the <orgName>House
                                of Commons</orgName> did, on the <date when="1787-05-09">Ninth of May last</date>, come to the Following Resolution: <quote rend="quotes">That this
                                House will, early in the next Session of Parliament, proceed to take into Consideration the 
                                Circumstances of the Slave Trade complained of in the Petitions now lying upon the Table, and
                                what may be fit to be done theron;</quote> and that a Bill was brought in, for providing certain
                                temporary Regulations respecting the Transportation of Slaves in <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Bottoms from the Coast of
                                <placeName>Africa</placeName>; which Bill has since passed into Law.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your Committee are of opinion, That the Principle of the said Act of the <orgName>British Parliament</orgName>
                                is founded in Justice, Humanity, and Necessity; and that the Provisions adopted therein, when
                                further matured by the Wisdom of <orgName>Parliament</orgName>, must ultimately prove highly beneficial to the
                                Sugar Colonies, inasmuch as it is notorious, that Vessels have been frequently corded with a
                                greater Number of Negroes than they ought in Prudence to have contained. And it is the
                                Opinion of the Committee that the Wisdom and Authority of <orgName>Parliament</orgName> might be beneficially
                                exerted, in further Regulations of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Commerce; particularly in preventing the Detention
                                of Ships on the Coast; in prohibiting the Purchase of Slaves who shall appear to have been 
                                kidnapped, or deprived of Liberty contrary to the Usage and Custom of <rs type="properAdjective">Africa</rs>; and in compelling
                                the said Ships to transport an equal Number of both Sexes, and to provide Ventilators 
                                and a sufficient Quantity of Provisions, especially Water. It seems not to be understood in Great
                                Britain, that the Inhabitants of the <placeName>West India Islands</placeName> have no Concern in the Ships trading
                                to <placeName>Africa</placeName>. The <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade is purly a <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Trade, carried on by <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Subjects residing
                                in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> of Capitals of their own. The Connection and Intercourse between Planters of
                                this Island, and the Merchants of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> trading to <placeName>Africa</placeName>, extend no further than the mere
                                Purchase of what <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Acts of <orgName>Parliament</orgName> have declared to be legal Objects of Purchase.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your Committee are further of opinion, That as to the Charges and Allegations brought against
                                us, with regard to the Treatment and Situation of Slaves in this Island, it is necessary and easy to 
                                disprove the same, by demonstrating, 1st, That Negroes in this Island are under the Protection of
                                lenient and salutary Laws, suited to their Situation and Circumstances: 2d, That the Slave Laws are
                                executed with Humanity, Mildness and Mercy: 3d, That the Laws have made Provision to
                                grant Slaves Days of Rest, and to prevent their being in want of the Necessaries of Life: and
                                4th, That the Decrease of our Slaves does not arise from the Causes alleged in the Petitions
                                presented to the <orgName>British House of Commons</orgName>, but from various other Causes not imputable to us,
                                and which the People in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> do not seem to comprehend.
                            </p>
                            <p>And your Committee are of opinion, That to disprove the said Charges and Allegations,
                                it is proper to recommend to the House, to grant the Committee Power to send for Persons,
                                Papers, and Records, and to examine all Persons that shall come before them in the most solemn
                                Manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Ordered, that the said Committee have Power to send for Persons, Papers, and Records, and
                                to examine all Persons that shall come before them, in the most solemn manner.

                                of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, many of which related to the Condition and
                                Government of our Slaves, and in Answer thereto an Abstract of most of our ancient Slave Laws
                                was laid before their Lordships; to which, if necessary, Reference may be had; but it seems
                                not to have been understood by our Agents, that in <date when="1781">1781</date> many of those Laws were repealed, and
                                all the subsisting Laws, and Clauses of Laws, respecting the Order and Government of Slaves,
                                were consolidated and brought into One Act. This act is known by the Name of the <title>Consolidated
                                Slave Act</title>, and having expired on the <date when="1784-12-31">31st Day of December 1784</date>, has since been
                                renewed with Amendments. By the said Act of <date when="1781">1781</date>, Clauses 2d and 3d, all Possessors of 
                                Plantations are obliged, under 50l. to allot Provision Grounds for each of their
                                Slaves, to allow them sufficient Time to work the same, and also to keep in proper Cultivation
                                One Acre of Land at least for every Four Negroes, in Plantain Walk and Ground Provisions;
                                exclusive of the Negroes Grounds, and in case the Owners or Possessors have not Hands proper
                                for that Purpose, they are required to make some other ample Provision for the Support of their
                                Slaves.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause the 4th it is enacted, That every Master, Owner, or Possessor of Slaves, shall, under
                                the same Penalty, provide and give to each Slave proper and sufficient Clothing to be approved
                                of by the Justices and Vestry of the Parish.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 5th, Slaves giving Information of Thefts, or other Crimes and Misdemeanors, are
                                entitled to pecuniary Rewards; which is One Proof, among others, that our Laws consider
                                Slaves and capable of holding Property, and will protect them therein.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 6th, the Penalty of 100l. is laid on any Master or Owner who shall mutilate or
                                dismember any Slave or Slaves.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 7th it is enacted, That in case any Person shall mutilate any Slave the Property of
                                another, such further Punishment should be inflicted, exclusive of the aforesaid fine, as the
                                Court should think proper, and at the same Time the Owner of the injured Slave is allowed to
                                pursue his Remedy for Damages at common Law.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 8th, any Person, wantonly beating a Slave, not his own Property, is liable to be
                                indicted for the same, and punished by Fine and Imprisonment.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 28th, further Security was given to Slaves, by altering the Mode of Trial of such
                                as stood charged with capital Offences; for by former Laws such Trials were directed to be held 
                                before Two Justices and three Freeholders indiscriminately chosen; whereas by the said act of 
                                <date when="1781">1781</date> it was enacted that the Freeholders on such Trial should be chosen by Ballot, and out of a
                                Number not less than Five.
                            </p>
                            <p>When we reflect that many of these Clauses were Provisions of our ancient Laws, and in particular
                                that the Penalty on the Master who should mutilate or dismember his Slave was enacted
                                so long ago as the Year <date when="1717">1717</date>; and when we consider further that the said Act of <date when="1781">1781</date> was in
                                full force until <date when="1784-12-31">31st December 1784</date>, we cannot sufficiently express our Astonishment and Concern
                                that respectable Bodies of Men should have subscribed their Names to Allegations, which a
                                little Inquiry must have convinced them were totally groundless.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the <date when="1784-12-31">31st of December 1784</date>, the <title>Consolidated Slave Law of <date>1781</date></title> (as hath been already observed)
                                expired, and as it appears by the Minutes of the House that on the <date when="1784-10-20">20th Day of October
                                1784</date>, a Committee was appointed to bring in a Bill to revive and continue the same; but so many
                                Improvements and Amendments were proposed for giving further Protection and Security to
                                Slaves, particularly in the Mode of Trial for capital Offences, that it was thought advisable to
                                disperse throughout the Island printed Copies of the new Bill, with the intended Alterations, in
                                order that the full Sense of the Country thereon might be collected against the next Session of
                                Assembly: Much pressing Business prevented it passing into a Law in <date when="1785">1785</date> and <date when="1786">1786</date>, and in
                                <date when="1787">1787</date> the Assembly was dissolved; but the new Assembly, which met in <date when="1787-10">October 1787</date>, among 
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                the first Objects of their Attention, took the Subject into their Consideration, and passed the 
                                <title>Consolidated Slave Bill</title> which is now in force, wherein, among other Improvements and Amendments
                                to the Act of <date when="1781">1781</date>, it may be sufficient to enumerate the following:
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 4th, regulations are made to prevent Slaves being deserted in future by their
                                Owners, on account of Age and Infirmity; and by a subsequent Clause the Justices and Vestry of
                                each Town and Parish empowered to lay a Tax upon the Inhabitants for providing Food, medical
                                Care and Attendance on Slaves already deserted by their Owners, and who are disabled from
                                Labour, by Sickness, old Age, or otherwise. And in order more effectually to enforce the 
                                Regulations of Former Laws respecting the Subsistence and Clothing of Slaves, it is enacted by Clause
                                6th, That every Master, Owner, or Attorney, shall under Penalty of 50l. give in to the Vestry,
                                on Oath, an Account of the Quantity of Land in Ground Provisions (over and above the Negro
                                Grounds) for the Use of their Slaves; or in case there are not Lands proper for the Purpose, an
                                Account on Oath of the Means adopted for the Maintenance and Support of their Slaves, and
                                also under the like Penalty give in an account of the Clothing actually served to each Slave.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 9th, The Penalty on Persons mutilating or dismembering their Slaves is increased,
                                by adding to the Fine of 100l. inflicted by former Laws, the Punishment of imprisonment, not
                                exceeding Twelve Months, and in certain Cases mutilated Slaves are to be declared Free; and in
                                all such Cases the Court is authorised to direct that the Fine of 100l. be paid over to the Justices
                                and Vestry of the Parish, who in consideration thereof are to allow to such Slave declared free
                                10l. per Annum for Maintenance and Support during Life. By the same Clause the Justices and
                                Vestry are appointed a Council of Protection, for the purposes of making full Inquiry into the
                                Mutilation of Slaves, and for prosecuting to Effect such Owner or Owners as may have been
                                guilty thereof, And by Clause 10th it is enacted, That in case any Information is made before
                                any Justice of the Peace, that any Slave or Slaves is or are mutilated and confined, it shall and
                                may be lawful for such Justice of the Peace, as he is required to issue his Warrant to the Marshal
                                or Constable, to bring the Slave or Slaves before him for Inspection.
                            </p>
                            <p>By this Regulation the Power of Concealment is endeavoured to be taken from the Owner; for
                                as it is not required that the Information should be on Oath, the Magistrate is enable to obtain
                                a View of the Fact on Evidence, which in other Cases is and ought to be inadmissible.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 11th is enacted, That is any Person shall murder any Slave, whether his own
                                Property of not, he shall suffer Death for such Offence.
                            </p>
                            <p>And in order more effectually to prevent the Destruction of Negroes by excessive Labour and
                                unreasonable Punishments, the Surgeon of every Plantation, by a subsequent Clause, is required to
                                give in on Oath to the Justices and Vestry, an annual Account of the Decrease and Increase of
                                the Slaves of such Plantation, with the Causes of such Decrease, to the best of his Knowledge,
                                Judgment, and Belief.
                            </p>
                            <p ana="#punishment">On his Head the Committee cannot but remark how tender and cautious every rational Manager
                                must necessarily be, in the Punishments which he administers, who considers that the has a
                                resident Inspector into his Conduct, and that the Punishments of Death may follow and Abuse of his
                                Authority.
                            </p>
                            <p>Neither does the Law extend its protection to the industrious and faithful Negro only; Provision
                                is made for the Support of such Fugitives and Criminals as are apprehended and lodged in 
                                the Gaols and Workhouses of this Island; the daily Allowance of good and wholesome Food
                                required, by Clase 31st, to be given to every Slave in Confinement, being abundantly liberal,
                                and as we conceive unexampled in most other Countries to unhappy Persons in similar 
                                Circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p>Having this briefly stated the Protection which the Laws of this Island have provided for our
                                Slaves in the grand Circumstance of personal Safety; we now proceed to the Second Head,
                                namely, to prove <quote rend="quotes">That the Slave Laws in this Island are executed with Humility, Mildness,
                                and Mercy.</quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>By the Slave Laws here alluded to, we understand the Laws and Clauses of Laws which assign
                                Penalties and Punishments on such Offences and Transgressions of our Slaves as affect the Public;
                                and in order to obtain the fullest Information on this Head, we have called on the several Clerks
                                of the Peace of the different Precincts and Parishes for Returns of all Trials of Slaves, with the
                                Charges, Conviction, and Punishment, severall had thereon, for several Years last past, viz. from

                            <p>In the several Towns and Parishes of <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, <placeName>Port Royal</placeName>, and <placeName>Portland</placeName>, containing 12,928 
                                Slaves, there do not appear to be any capital Convictions within the said Period, but the Records
                                of Trials in the Town of <placeName>Kingston</placeName> previous to <date when="1787">1787</date> are not to be found.

                            <p>The Total appears to be 52 Executions in Four Years and Nine Months, which is not more than
                                Eleven per annum, for the last Five Years, out of 210, 894 Slaves.—A Proof of Lenity in the 
                                Execution of our Criminal Laws, not to be surpassed, as we conceive, by any Nation in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.
                                Nothing further, therefor, seems necessary to be added on this Head, except the 40th Clause of the
                                present <title>Consolidated Slave Bill</title>, which directs, That in all Cases where the Punishment of Death
                                is inflicted, the Execution shall be performed in a public Part of the Parish, and with due
                                Solemnity; and Care shall be taken by the Gaoler, or Deputy-Marshal, that the Criminal is free from
                                Intoxication at the Time of his Trial, and from thence, to and at the Time of his Execution,
                                under the Penalty of 5l.: And the Mode of such Execution is directed to be, hanging by the Neck, and
                                no other. It is likewise provided, That where several Slaves are capitally convicted for the same
                                Offence, One only shall suffer Death, except in Cases of Murder or Rebellion.
                            </p>
                            <p>But the Committee cannot quit this Subject without observing, That the Number of Negroes at
                                this Time actually living within this Island, is much greater than appears on the Tax Rolls from
                                exempt Persons who have not more than Six Negroes from the Payment of Taxes on Slaves, whereby
                                many of the Negroes (especially in the Towns) are not given in to the different Vestries, and the
                                Returns of a great many other are fraudulently concealed. We judge, after diligent Investigation,
                                that the whole Number of Negro Slaves now actually in the Island, are 240,000 at the least.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the Third Ground of Inquiry we are to demonstrate, That the Laws have made Provision to
                                grant Slaves Days of Rest, and to Prevent their being in want of the Necessaries of Life.
                            </p>
                            <p>Although we conceive that this Assertion has been sufficiently established by the Recital already
                                given of such Clauses of our Laws as relate to the Subsistence of our Slaves, yet as the Words
                                <quote rend="quotes">sufficient Time</quote> in one of the Clauses referred to, left a discretionary Power in the Master, we
                                shall take occasion, in a subsequent Part of our Report, to show that the Legislature has provided a
                                Remedy against any possible Abuse of such discretionary Authority.—But the Further Discussion of
                                this Subject is deferred until we treat of the new Slave Bill passed the present Session.

                            <p>On the Fourth and Last  Ground of our Researches, namely, to demonstrate, <quote rend="quotes">That the Decrease
                                of our Slaves does not arise from the Causes assigned in the Petitions presented to the <orgName>British House
                                of Commons</orgName>, but from other Causes not imputable to us, and which the People of Great Britain
                                do not seem to comprehend;</quote> the Committee, after diligent Inquiry and Investigation, are of
                                opinion, that the following are the principal Causes to which the alleged Decrease of our Slaves
                                ought justly to be imputed:—First, The Disproportion between the Sexes in the annual Importations 
                                from <placeName>Africa</placeName>. <seg ana="#disease">Second, The Loss of new Negroes on, or soon after their Arrival, from epidemic
                                Diseases brought from Africa, or contracted in the Voyage.</seg>
                            </p>
                            <p>Respecting the First of these Causes, the Committee have examined the most considerable <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs>
                                Factors residing in this Island as to the relative Numbers of Males and Females imported and sold
                                annually for several Years past; and it appears from the Examination of <persName>Robert Hibbert</persName>, Esquire,
                                a Member of this House, that of 16,254 Negroes imported and sold by <persName>Messrs. Hibberts</persName> and
                                <persName>Jackson</persName> between the Years <date when="1764">1764</date> and <date when="1774">1774</date>, 10,149 were Males, and 6,145 Females. It likewise
                                appears from the Examinations of <persName>Messrs. Coppells</persName>, and <persName>Messrs. Rainsfords</persName>, <persName>Messrs. Mures</persName> and
                                <persName>Dunlop</persName>, and <persName>Alexander Lindo</persName>, Merchant, that out of 32,881 Slaves sold by them collectively
                                within these Seven Years last past, the Number of Males was 20,487, and of Females, 12,394.
                                The Relative Proportion of the whole is Five Males to Three Females.
                            </p>
                            <p>We have annexed to this Report, Extracts from the Books of the aforesaid Factors, as 
                                produced by them to this Committee, and from which the above statement is formed. They are
                                marked as Nº 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
                            </p>
                            <p>With respect to the Second Cause of such Decrease, our Inquiries for the present have been
                                confined to the Number of new Negroes, that have perished in the Harbours of this Island, between
                                the time of their having been reported at the Custom-house and the Day of Sale; all which
                                are included in official Books and Returns as Negroes actually imported. From the Examination
                                of <persName>Mr. Lindo</persName> it appears, that out of 7,873 Negroes consigned to him as Factor in the Years
                                <date when="1786">1786</date>, <date when="1787">1787</date>, and <date when="1788">1788</date>, and reported at the Custom-house, no less than 262 perished in the
                                Harbour of <placeName>Kingston</placeName> before the Day of Sale; and if the same Proportion of Deaths be allowed to
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                the whole of the <name>Africans</name> imported since the Conquest of the Island to the present Time (an 
                                Allowance which, on many Accounts, we conceive to be moderate), the Numbers that have thus
                                perished are very considerable. We have thought it necessary to investigate this Circumstance
                                with as much Precision as the Subject will admit; and having, from the Books of the Receiver-
                                General, and other sufficient Authorities, procured the most exact Account that can be formed 
                                of the Imports and Exports of Negroes into and from this Island from the Year <date when="1655">1655</date> (the Time
                                of its Conquest) to <date when="1787-12">December 1787</date>, we find the Imports to amount to 676,276 Negroes; of
                                which according to the Proportion above stated, no less than 31, 181 will appear to have died on
                                Ship-board after Entry, although they stand in the Books of Office as constituting Part of the
                                actual Numbers supposed to have been distributed among the Planters, and destroyed by Neglect,
                                excessive Labour, or other Mal-treatment.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Committee are of opinion, that these Data lead to important Conclusions; for if the
                                Negroes that have perished as above, and the further Number of 160,449 (being the Total of
                                the Exports), making together 191,627, be subtracted from the Total of the Imports, it will 
                                appear, that the full Number of Slaves which have been introduced and left in the Country from
                                the Conquest of the Island to <date when="1787-12">December of 1787</date>, is reduced to 484, 649. Of this Number, if a
                                Further Reduction of Two-fifths be made (which most have happened in any Country, and under
                                any System of Government) to bring the Sexes to an Equality, the Balance is 290, 791. A further
                                Reduction must likewise be made for Negroes that have deserted from their Owners, and left
                                the Island; many Hundreds within these few Years having been inveigled over to <placeName>Cuba</placeName>, and
                                great Numbers have been stolen by Privateers in Times of War; others are annual carried to
                                <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and shipped off the Island by their Owners, of which no Account is preserved; exclusive
                                of such as were executed and transported in the several great Rebellions, and such as have
                                been transported for other Offences by the Sentence of the Law. It is impossible to ascertain
                                with Precision the Result of these several combined Causes; but we conceive that a Loss of
                                13,000 Negroes at the least bay be justly assigned to them since the first Settlement of the Island,
                                which is not quite an Average of a Hundred per Annum, and which brings the Remainder to
                                277,791. On the other Hand, to the Number of 140,000 Negroes actually living in the Island
                                on the <date when="1787-12-31">31st of December 1787</date>, as before stated, must be added to the People called the Maroons,
                                amounting by the last Returns, to about 1300; and also all the Free Negroes, and People of
                                Colour; the latter as being Descendents from the Black Females of the original Stock.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is not easy to ascertain either of these Classes, with any Degree of Precision, from the Tax-
                                rolls, or from the Law, which requires Free Negroes, to take out Certificates, and wear the Badge
                                of their Freedom, as the Law is very seldom complied with; many of the Free Negroes considering
                                the Badge rather as a Token of Disgrace than a Mark of Distinction. We judge, on a
                                loose Computation, that the Free Negroes and People of Colour, of all Ages, and both Sexes,
                                cannot amount together to less than 500 in each Parish on an Average of the whole, which gives
                                10,000. The Total is 251,300, which, being subtracted from 277,791, leaves 26, 491 as the
                                Number which would have decreased since the Year <date when="1655">1655</date>, under all Circumstances, and supposing
                                even that the Sexes had been equally distributed.
                            </p>
                            <p>We shall now point out the principal Causes to which this Mortality is justly chargeable. It
                                is but too well known to the House, that in the several Years <date when="1780">1780</date>, <date when="1781">1781</date>, <date when="1784">1784</date>, <date when="1785">1785</date>, and
                                <date when="1786">1786</date>, it pleased Divine Providence to visit this Island with repeated Hurricanes, which spread
                                Desolation throughout most Parts of the Island; but the Parishes which suffered more remarkably
                                than the rest were those of <placeName>Westmoreland</placeName>, <placeName>Hanover</placeName>, <placeName>St. James</placeName>, <placeName>Trelawny</placeName>, <placeName>Portland</placeName>, and 
                                <placeName>St. Thomas in the East</placeName>. By these destructive Visitation, the Plantain Walks, which furnish the
                                chief Article of Support to the Negroes, were generally rooted up; and the intense Droughts
                                which followed destroyed those different Species of Ground Provisions which the Hurricanes had
                                not reached. The storms of <date when="1780">1780</date> and <date when="1781">1781</date> happening during the Time of War, no foreign
                                Supplies, excepting a trifling Assistance from Prize Vessels, could be obtained on any Terms; and
                                a Famine ensued in the leeward Parts of the Island, which destroyed many thousand Negroes,
                                After the Storm of the <date when="1784-07-30">30th July 1784</date>, the Lieutenant Governor, by the Advice of his Council,
                                published a Proclamation, dated the 7th of August, permitting the free Importation of
                                Provisions and Lumber in Foreign Bottoms for Four Months from that Period. As this was much
                                too short a Time to give sufficient Notice, and obtain all the Supplies that were necessary, the
                                small Quantities of Flour, Rice, and other Provisions, which were imported in consequence of
                                the Proclamation, soon rose to so exorbitant a Price as to induce the Assembly, on the <date when="--11-09">9th of
                                November</date> the following, to present an Address to the Lieutenant Governor, requesting him to prolong
                                the Term until the latter end of <date when="1785-03">March 1785</date>; observing, that it was impossible for the
                                natural Productions of the Country to come to such Maturity as to be wholesome Food before
                                that Time. The Term of Four Months not being expired when this Address was presented,
                                the Lieutenant Governor declined to comply therewith; but, on the <date when="--12-01">1st of December</date> following,
                                the House represented, that a Prolongation of the Term was then absolutely necessary. They
                                observe, That, persuaded of the Reluctance with which his Honour would be brought to deviate
                                from Regulations which e felt himself bound to observe, it would give them much Concern to
                                address him on the same Occasion a second Time, were they not convinced that it was in a
                                Case of such extreme Necessity, as to justify such a Deviation. Accordingly the Lieutenant
                                Governor, by the Advice of his Majesty's Council, directed, that the Time formerly limited
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                should be extended to the <date when="1785-01-31">31st of January then ensuing (1785)</date>; but at the same Time
                                he informed the House, that he was not at liberty to deviate any longer from the Regulations
                                which had been established in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>.
                            </p>
                            <p>From the <date when="1785-01-31">31st of January 1785</date>, therefore, the Ports continued shut, and the Sufferings of the
                                poor Negroes in consequence thereof, for some Months afterwards, were extreme; providentially
                                the Season became more favourable about May, and considerable Quantities of Corn and Ground 
                                Provisions were gathered in by the Month of August, when the Fourth Storm happened, and the 
                                Lieutenant Governor immediately shut the Ports against the Exportation of any of our Provisions
                                to the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> Islands, which were supposed to have suffered more than ourselves; but
                                not thinking himself at liberty to permit the Importation of Provisions in American Vessels,
                                the Productions of the Country were soon exhausted, and the usual Attendants of scanty and 
                                unwholesome Diet, Dropsied and epidemic Dysenteries, were again dreadfully prevalent in the Spring
                                and Summer of <date when="1786">1786</date>, and proved fatal to great Numbers of the Negroes in all Parts of the 
                                Country.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the <date when="1786-10-20">20th of October</date> in that Year happened the Fifth dreadful Hurricane, which again
                                laid waste the leeward Parishes and completed the Tragedy. We decline to enlarge on the
                                Consequences which followed, lest we may appear to exaggerate; but having endeavoured to
                                compute, with as much Accuracy as the Subject will admit, the Number of Slaves, whose
                                Destruction may be fairly attributed to these repeated Calamities, and the unfortunate Measure
                                of interdicting foreign Supplies, and for this Purpose compared the Imports and Returns of
                                Negroes for the last Seven Years, with those of Seven Years preceding, we hesitate not, after
                                every Allowance for adventitious Causes, to fix the whole at 15,000. This Number we firmly
                                believe to have perished of Famine, or of Diseases contracted by scanty and unwholesome Diet,
                                between the latter End of <date when="1780">1780</date>, and the Beginning of <date when="1787">1787</date>.
                            </p>
                            <p>But the most general and prevailing Causes of the Decrease of our Slaves, and which are
                                abundantly sufficient to account for the Loss which is not already accounted for, are palpable to
                                every Observer; they are undoubtedly, First, the great proportion of Deaths that happen among
                                Negroes newly imported (exclusively of the Mortality which has been stated to occur before
                                landing); and secondly, the Loss which prevails among the Negro Infants that are born in the
                                Country. Of the latter it is believed, that One-fourth Part perish within Fourteen Days of the
                                Birth; but we can form no precise Estimate of the proportionate Loss of new Negroes, inasmuch
                                as the Diseases with which many of them are afflicted put on various Appearances, and are of a
                                tedious and lingering Nature, and may therefore be such as are common both to the new Negroes
                                and the old. Nevertheless, in order to collect the best Information in our Power on Subjects so
                                interesting to the Community, we have thought it necessary to take the Examination thereon of
                                some Gentlemen who are eminent in the Knowledge and Practice of Physic and Surgery, To
                                these Examinations, which are marked Nº 6, 7, and 8, the Committee refer, and are happy to observe,
                                that it is extremely probable the Regulating Act lately passed by the <orgName>British Parliament</orgName>,
                                when further matured, will greatly contribute to lessen in future that dreadful Mortality which
                                there has been so much Cause to lament, as well in the Voyages from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, as among the
                                Negroes after their Arrival in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. With such happy Consequences resulting from
                                the beneficial Provisions of the said Act of the <orgName>British Parliament</orgName>, and the Encouragement which
                                has been given, by a Bill passed in this Island this present Session, to the Overseers of our Plantations,
                                to induce them to take all possible Care of the new-born Infants, as will hereafter be more
                                particularly mentioned; the Committee have no Reason to suppose that the Increase of our Negroes
                                by Generation (from the Time that the Sexes shall become nearly equal in point of Number)
                                will fall short of the natural Increase which occurs among the labouring Poor of Great
                                Britain.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Committee might here conclude their Report; but having referred to a new Bill, which
                                has passed the House this present Session, for giving further Protection and Security to our Slaves,
                                and for altering the Mode of Trial of such as shall be charged with capital Offences we think
                                ourselves called upon, in Justice to the House, to subjoin an Abridgement of the principal Clauses
                                and Provisions contained therein.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Distinguishing Feature of this Bill, as the Title imports, is the Alteration in the
                                Modes and Trials of our Slaves, by referring all capital Offences to the Jurisdiction of the
                                Courts of Quarter Session which are held every Three Months in the several Precincts and Parishes
                                of the Island. By this Regulation the Offender will have the Security both of grand and petit
                                Jury, and even the Suspicion of Partiality or undue Influence will be obviated. It is further
                                enacted, That no less than Three Justices, One of whom to be of the Quorum, shall constitute
                                a Court at the Trial of Slaves at the Quarter Sessions; and that if the Jury apply to the Court to
                                suspend the Execution of the Sentence until the Pleasure of the Commander in Chief is known,
                                the Court shall be obliged to suspend the same for Thirty Days.
                            </p>
                            <p ana="#punishment">Petty Offences, for which no punishment exceeding Fifty Lashes, and Six Months Confinement
                                to hard Labour, is assigned, are cognizable before Two Justices of the Peace; and it is
                                expressly declared, That neither the Courts of Quarter Session, nor the Justices, shall have Power
                                to order any Slave to be mutilated or maimed for any Offence whatsoever.
                            </p>
                            <p>By another Clause Encouragement is given to all Masters and Mistresses, Owners, or in their
                                Absence, Overseers of Slaves, as much as in them lies, to endeavour the Instruction of their
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                Slaves in the Principles of the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Religion, thereby to facilitate their Conversion, and fit
                                them for Baptism; and as soon as conveniently they can, they shall cause to be baptised all such
                                as they can make sensible of a Deity and the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Faith.
                            </p>
                            <p>Another very important Object of this Bill is, the Correction of Two material Errors which had
                                been accidentally made in the Consolidated Slave Bill of last Year; the Words <quote rend="quote">without Benefit
                                of Clergy,</quote> in the Clause which assigns the Punishment of Death to Persons wantonly killing
                                a Negro, or other Slave, having been undesignedly omitted, there are now restored. And another
                                Clause in the said Consolidated Slave Bill, which inflicted Punishments on Persons wantonly and
                                cruelly beating Slaves, and imprisoning them without sufficient Support, having been interpreted
                                not to extend to such Slaves as were the Property of the Offender, has been amended, and the
                                Protection which it affords is now extended to all Slaves without Distinction.
                            </p>
                            <p>Further, in the View of Restraining arbitrary Punishments, it is by the said Bill enacted, That
                                no Slave, on any Plantation or Settlement, or in any of the Workhouses or Jails in this Island, 
                                shall receive more than Ten Lashes at One Time, and for One Offence, unless the Owner, Attorney,
                                Guardian, Executor, Administrator, or Overseer of such Plantation or Settlement, or
                                Supervisor of such Workhouse, or Keeper of such Jail, shall be present; and no such Owner,
                                Attorney, Guardian, Executor, Administrator, or Overseer, Supervisor or Jail-keeper, shall on
                                any Account punish a Slave with more than Thirty-nine Lashes at One Time and for One Offence,
                                under Penalty of 5 l. for every Offence, to be recovered against the Person directing
                                or permitting such Punishment.
                            </p>
                            <p>Another Object of this Bill, as hath been already observed, is, to secure to our Slaves Days of
                                Rest, and sufficient Time to cultivate their Grounds, in order to prevent their being in want of
                                the Necessaries of Life; for which Purpose, after reciting, that although it hath been customary
                                with the Planters in this Island to allow their Slaves One Day in every Fortnight (exclusive of
                                Sundays), yet this Indulgence not being compulsory, it is enacted by the said Bill, That the Slaves
                                belonging to, or employed on every Plantation or Settlement, shall, over and above the usual
                                Holidays allowed them at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, be allowed One Day in every
                                Fortnight, to cultivate their own Provision Grounds (exclusive of Sundays), except during the
                                Time of Crip, under the Penalty of 10l. to be recovered against the Overseer, or other Person
                                having the Care of such Slaves. And,
                            </p>
                            <p>Lastly, with Intention to prevent, as far as possible, the great Mortality which as been stated
                                to prevail among the new-born Negro Infants, it is also enacted, that in case it shall appear to 
                                the Satisfaction of the Justices and Vestry of each Parish, from the Returns required to be
                                made annually, that there has been a natural Increase in the Number of Slaves on any such Plantation,
                                Penn, or other Settlement, the Overseer shall be entitled to receive from the Owner or
                                Proprietor of such Plantation, Penn, or other Settlement, the Sum of Twenty Shillings for every
                                Slave born on such Plantation, Penn, or Other Settlement, and which shall be then living at the
                                Time of giving in such annual Returns; and the Owner or Proprietor of such Plantation, Penn,
                                or other Settlement, shall have a Deduction from the first of his or her public Taxes that shall
                                become due, of the Sum so paid to the Overseer, on producing a Certificate of the Justices and
                                Vestry of such Increase, and a Receipt of the Overseer for the Sum so paid.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your Committee cannot conclude without observing, that if, notwithstanding all that we have
                                urged in our own Vindication from the groundless Charges that have been made on our Humanity
                                in the Treatment of Slaves, it shall be determined by the <orgName>British Parliament</orgName> to abolish
                                trust in the Justice of the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Nation, that we shall not be made the Sacrifice on this 
                                Occasion, but that the Legislature will give us such a compensation as the consequent Diminution
                                in the Value of our Properties, and their ultimate Destruction, shall entitle us to expect. We
                                have the greater Reason to indulge this Expectation from the Justice that has been done to the
                                late Proprietors of <placeName>Florida</placeName>, and also to such of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Merchants as would be Sufferers by
                                the late Regulations.

                                upwards.

                            <p>Saith, That a great Proportion of Negro Infants perish between the Fifth and Fourteenth Days
                                after their Births, he believes nearly One-fourth Part of all that are born. The Species of 
                                Tetanus by which so many Negro Children are destroyed, is described by medical Writers under the
                                Name of Opisthotunus, or that Kind of Spasm in which the Muscles that bend the Spine backwards,
                                with those of the lower Jaw, are affected. It is commonly ascribed to One of the Three
                                following Causes: 1st, An Affection of the Bowels arising from the Meconium of Fœces (lodged
                                there before Birth) not being sufficiently purged off. 2dly, From obstructed Perspiration. 2dly,
                                From the Irritation occasioned by the improper Treatment of the Sore remaining after the umbilical
                                Chord has dropped off. He is of opinion, it seldom or never proceeds from the first Cause;
                                for it is a very common Custom with the Midwives to give the Children a good deal of Oil
                                and Sugar soon after they are born, by which they are much purged: Notwithstanding Children
                                so treated are frequently attacked with this Complained, besides Bowel Complaints, whether in
                                Children or Adults, though they frequently occasion Convulsions, and sometimes Palsy, yet he
                                believes they never occasion fixed Spasm. In regard to the second Cause, although he makes no
                                doubt it may occasion this Complaint in Children, as he has certainly seen it do in Adults,
                                yet he is inclined to think it seldom does. His Reasons are, that when this Complaint takes place
                                in Adults from obstructed Perspiration, it generally runs out to a great Length, and is not
                                generally fatal; whereas the Complaint in the Infant we are now treating of, always terminates
                                in a few Days, and is almost universally fatal. Further, this Complaint in Infants constantly
                                makes its Appearance between the Fifth and Fourteenth Day after Birth; but Children are not
                                more subject to Colds at that than at any other Period. The Third Cause appears generally.
                                if not in every Instance, to occasion this Disorder; it is universally known, that whatever villicates
                                or irritates the minute Branches of Nerves, whether by Puncture, Laceration, Burning, or Friction
                                on a raw Place, will in tropical Climates, occasion this Complaint even in Adults, but much
                                more readily in the tender Bodies of Infants. We also know, that in Negro Children, after the
                                umbilical Chord has fallen off, the raw Part, after being slightly covered with Lint or Rag, is
                                bound round with a coarse Cloth, and that in a few Hours is soaked in the Child's Urine, in
                                which State it is suffered to remain, producing a Degree of Irritation, much more than sufficient
                                to produce this Spasm. When it is considered this Complaint takes place between the Fifth and
                                Fourteenth Day only, it must be allowed to be excited by some Cause that is also confined to the
                                same Period; but the Cause just mentioned is the only one that occurs at no other Period in Life,
                                as far as we know.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That if he is right in his Theory respecting the Cause of this Complaint, it will be
                                supposed that the Remedy is obvious, as it will be only directing a greater Attention to be paid
                                to the Dressing and Cleanliness of the Infant during the Period above alluded to; but simple as 
                                this may appear in Theory, those who are much conversant with Negroes will be aware of the
                                Difficulty, if not Impossibility, of putting it in practice in a Degree sufficient to answer the
                                Purpose; for such is the Ignorance, Obstinacy, and Inattention of Negroes, so little Regard have
                                they for each other, and so averse are they to executing the Directions of White People, when
                                repugnant to their own Prejudices, that he believes the Evil can never be wholly remedied, while
                                we are obliged to employ Negroes as Nurses.
                            </p>
                            <p>Being asked, Whether he hath not observed a great Mortality among Negroes newly imported,
                                and to what Cause or Causes he imputes the same,
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That a very great Number of newly-imported Negroes are lost by Diseases, the predisposing
                                Causes of which they bring to this Country along with them. Most new Negroes, when 
                                first landed, are much subject to putrid Complaints arising from a scorbutic Habit contracted
                                during the Voyage, which frequently manifests itself soon after they are landed in putrid 
                                Dysenteries, or by Foul Ulcers tending strongly to Mortification. Many Negroes, while aboard, are
                                afflicted with the most virulent venereal Complaints, others have the Yaws, some malignant Ulcers;
                                all of which, when the Day of Sale draws near, are, by the Management of the Ship's Surgeon, 
                                dried up, and the morbid Matter repelled into the System, so that the Surface of the Skin
                                shall appear clean and smooth for a Time; but which afterwards creates the most dreadful 
                                Complaints, too frequently baffling all Attempts to cure.

                            <p>Examinant is of opinion, That One-fourth Part of the Negro Infants perish before the
                                Ninth Day from the Birth, of the Tetanus or locked Jaw, a Disorder which the Negroes call the
                                Jaw-fall; and that its affecting Infants of that Age is peculiar to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>: That he is of
                                opinion, One-tenth Part of the White Infants perish in the same Manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That he made the Inquiry when in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> about Four Years ago, and
                                could hear of no such Disorder: That he is warranted to say, it is peculiar to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>,
                                from a late Publication of the famous <persName>Dr. Cullen</persName> of <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName>, who, in treating of the locked
                                Jaw in Infants, says, <quote rend="quotes">He speaks only from Information, for he never met with it in the Course

                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That he has made Inquiry among the most sensible Negro Women, and
                                that he never could learn the Disorder was known in <placeName>Africa</placeName>.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant faith, That he imputes the Cause to the Irritation of a putrid matter generated at
                                the Separation of the umbilical Chord, previous to the Separation, which generally happens from
                                the Fifth to the Seventh Day: That the Disorder may likewise proceed from Cold, or the Meconium
                                not being properly carried off, but these Causes occur very seldom: That the First Symptom
                                is an Uneasiness in the Infant, and Refusal of the Breast. In the course of a few Hours the Jaw
                                closes, a general Spasm takes place, and Death commonly ensues in the course of Twenty-four
                                Hours: That immediately before Death, a general Relaxation comes on, and the lower Jaw falls
                                on the Breast; thence called Jaw-fall by the Negroes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That he does not believe the Disorder in general is owing to any improper
                                Mode of Treatment of the Infant, as he has often known it occur notwithstanding the greatest
                                Care; and that, from the Rapidity of the Disorder, and the tender Age of the Patient, he knows
                                of no certain Remedy that succeeded, either from the Application of Opiates or any other 
                                Medicine, once in Twenty Times: That it occurs in hight and healthy Situations as well as in low 
                                ones; in mountainous Districts, as well as those near the Sea-side.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That great Losses are sustained in the Increase of Negroes from the Length
                                of Time the Negro Women continue their Children at the Breast, seldom less than Two Years,
                                and many of them more: That there is no remedying this Evil without great Discontent; as the
                                Mother, during the Time of her being a Nurse, is commonly allowed an Hour in turning out
                                to Labour later than the other Negroes, and returning an Hour earlier from Labour.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant is of an opinion, That many Negro Children die of that Disorder, peculiar to the
                                <name>Africans</name>, called the Yaws, particularly if they are infected during the first Year, which the
                                Mothers in general attempt to effect, on Purpose to excuse themselves from Labour.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant is of opinion, notwithstanding those Inconveniences already enumerated, there is
                                a very considerable Increase of Negroes on the Properties of this Island, particularly in the Parish
                                where he resides.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That the Losses sustained in seasoning newly-imported Negroes are chiefly
                                owing to the many Disorders they bring with them from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, or contracted on board Ship, such
                                as Venereals, the Yaws, and old habitual Ulcers.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, the Number of obstinate Cases he has met with, induced him to inquire of
                                Surgeons that had been in that Trade, respecting their Mode of Treatment during the Voyage;
                                and that he has been informed it was customary to suppress Venereals with astringent Injection,
                                to cause the Yaws and ulcers to disappear by escarotic Washes; and on the Day of Sale, or a
                                few Days before, to hid the Scars with blackening and Palm Oil: That the epidemic Dysentery 
                                is frequent on board Ship; and though the Surgeons have a Method of concealing it on the Day
                                of Sale, in some Measure, by Astringents, yet it frequently breaks out after the Negroes are
                                landed with double Fury, of which he remembers the following remarkable Instance; <persName>Mr. Colin
                                Campbell</persName>, out of <placeName>St. Ann's</placeName>, having bought Thirty Negroes in <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, and endemic Dysentery
                                broke out among them soon after their Arrival at the Plantation, of which Twenty-four of them
                                died; the Disorder was communicated to the rest of the Negroes on the Plantation, and several of
                                them likewise fell a sacrifice to it.

                            <p>Saith, That he studied Surgery in <placeName>London</placeName>, and Physic at <placeName>Leyden</placeName>, and served his Majesty
                                as an Assistant Surgeon in the Military Hospitals, in the former War, in <placeName>Germany</placeName>: That
                                he has practiced in this Island for upwards of Twenty-one Years: That for the greater Part of
                                that Time he has had from 4 to 5000 Slaves Constantly under his Care in the Parishes of

                            <p>Saith, That the local Circumstances attended Difference of Situation in this Island, occasion
                                so great a Diversity in the Diseases to which the Inhabitants of different Parts of this Country
                                are Subject, that the very few Observations thereon will be found to be universally true: that <choice><sic>heh as</sic><corr>he has</corr></choice>
                                not in general observed any very great Mortality amongst Negro Infants soon after their Birth,
                                in that part of the Country where he practices; nor any peculiar Disease, to which they are more
                                subject than any other Children would be under the same Circumstances; namely, First, The
                                known Want of Cleanliness, arising from the obstinate Attachment of Negro Women to their
                                old Customs; particularly to one so evidently mischievous in a warm Climate, as that of not
                                shifting the Child's Clothes for the first Three Days after its Birth; and sometimes from a
                                Deficiency of Linen, and other Necessaries proper for a new born Infant. Secondly, The Nature
                                of their Habitations, sometimes suffocating with Heat and Smoke; at others, when the Fire
                                subsides, especially by Night admitting the cold damp Air through innumerable Crevices and
                                Holes of the Walls, which are seldom kept in proper Repair; which sudden Transition from
                                Heat to Cold, by occasioning peripneumonic Fevers, he thinks to be the most general Cause of
                                the Death of new-born Negro Infants in that Part of the Country where he practices. And,
                                lastly, the injudicious Custom of suckling a new-born Child for the first Week after its Birth, or
                                longer, with the Milk of a Woman who often has a Child at her Breast a Year old, or perhaps older.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That in his Opinion difficult Labours happen as frequently among Negro Women here,
                                as amongst the Females of the labouring Poor in <placeName>England</placeName>; but that he has not observed that a
                                greater Proportion of the Infants of the former perish in the Delivery than of the latter.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That he does not conceive the Tetanus, or locked Jaw, to be a Disease common to
                                Infants in the Part where he practices: That he apprehends there may be Reason to suppose that
                                a Symptom, which generally attends approaching Death, from whatever Cause it may proceed
                                in Children, viz. a Paralysis of the Muscles of the lower Jaw, has been frequently mistaken, by
                                People acquainted with Medicine, for the Tetanus; as he has often observed the same Name
                                to be given in common Discourse to both those Affections, though of so different a Nature.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That Negro Women, whether Slaves or Free, do not in his Opinion breed so frequently
                                as the Women amongst the labouring Poor in Great Britain: That he ascribes this
                                chiefly to the promiscuous Intercourse which the greater Number of Negro Women indulge
                                themselves in with the other Sex: That he believes the Abortions, which he thinks to be rather
                                frequent amongst them, to be ascribably to the same Cause: That he has not bet with any Cases
                                of Abortion which he could fairly impute to ill Usage or excessive Labour: That moderate
                                Labour is beneficial to pregnant Women, as being the best Means of preserving general Health.

                            <p>Saith, That the Custom of carrying young Children into the Field in the Manner and with
                                the Precautions it is now practiced, is by no means hurtful to the Infants.

                                That Worm Complaints are more frequent here than in <placeName>England</placeName>; and the same epidemical

                                Cough, are equally common to Negro Children here, and in a severer Degree. Moreover, that
                                from the frequent shifting of the Connexion between the Sexes, many Children are lost through
                                Neglect and the Want of maternal Affection, which the Mothers seldom retain for their Offspring
                                by a former Husband.

                            <p>Saith, That in his Opinion any Attempt to restrain this licentious Intercourse between the
                                Sexes amongst the Slaves in this Island, in the present State of their Notions of Right and
                                Wrong, by introducing the Marriage Ceremony amongst them, would be utterly impracticable
                                and perhaps of dangerous Consequence, as these people are universally known to claim a Right
                                of disposing of themselves in this respect, according to their own Will and Pleasure, without
                                any control from their Masters.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That a greater Proportion of those called New Negroes die, than of those that are
                                seasoned to the Country. That in his Opinion this is often occasioned in those recently
                                imported, by the mad Habit of the Body these People have contracted from long Confinement,
                                bad Food, and improper Treatment in the Voyage. That within these last Twenty Years the
                                Treatment of new Negroes in this Island has been greatly altered for the better. That those
                                People are now in general treated with great Humanity and Tenderness, both before and after
                                they are become seasoned to the Country; and that he does not conceive the great Mortality
                                amongst them commonly to arise from want of Food or severe Labour.

                                    Time in taking the necessary and most effectual Steps to procure full and satisfactory Information
                                    upon the several Heads of Inquiry relative to the Slave Trade, and the Treatment of Negroes in

                                    Subject of so much Importance, I conceived that too much caution could not be observed in 
                                    procuring it, which has been the Cause of my not sooner having it in my Power to submit it to

                                    hope it will arrive soon enough to meet any Discussion upon the Merits of it in <orgName>Parliament</orgName>. I

                                    and it is more frequently remarked among the <distinct rend="italic">Popos</distinct> than the Natives of any other Country;
                                    but we do not affirm positively that Negroes from other Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName> may not likewise be
                                    addicted to it: The Earth which they search for, and devour with so much Avidity, is a
                                    saponaceous Marle. We are told that Cakes of a similar Earth are publicly sold at some of the
                                    <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Markets; and it is probably in Imitation  of that Practice, that <distinct rend="italic">Aboo</distinct>, or Earth-Cakes,
                                    are vended among the Negroes at <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. They are composed of a particular

                                    Nature, and dissolves easily in the Mouth. The Negroes who make frequent Use of this
                                    Substance say that it is sweetish. Many of them acquire a Habit of eating it to such Excess,
                                    that it often proves fatal to them <emph>It is a most certain Poison</emph> when used for any Length of Time;

                                    on their Way to his Plantation, chanced to espy a Vein of this Earth in a Bank by the Side of
                                    the Road, and shouted for Joy at the Discovery. 
                                </p>
                                <p>It is doubtful whether their Fondness of this Substance be the Occasion or the Consequence of
                                    a depraved Appetite. Some Plantations there are where no such Practice exists; but it is almost
                                    certain that it exists wheresoever a Vein of this Species of Earth happens to be discovered by any
                                    Negro whose Experience enables him to distinguish it. In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> they prefer what is gathered
                                    from the Beds of Rivers, as more free by its Dilution from the Intermixture of other Earths. In
                                    its fresh and moist State it is of a brownish Colour, and has somewhat the Appearance of
                                    ordinary Castile Soap, but after having been perfectly dried it turns white. Young Children are
                                    equally greedy of it; they either learn the Habit from Example of their Parents, or are regaled
                                    with it as a Dainty, or as an Antidote to Acidities or Pains in the Stomach, to which they are
                                    very subject: For the latter Purpose it may likewise be frequently taken by the older Negroes.
                                    It is certain that this Abuse, from whatever Motive it proceeds, adds largely to the annual
                                    Death roll of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.

                                    sold.

                                <p>The former Owner died soon afterwards, and left a Widow, One Son, and Two Daughters, in
                                    very distressed Circumstances.—Upon hearing of their unhappy Situation, the Negroes had a 
                                    Meeting, and agreed to pay an Annuity for the Support of their old Master's Family.—Not long
                                    since, the Son was observed by one of the Negroes, passing through the Plantation; and on his
                                    declaring his Poverty, the same Negroes assembled again, dispatched a Messenger to a Shop for 
                                    Clothes and Linen, and made up a little Purse for him of Three Pounds. This was entirely an
                                    extra Bounty; for as to the Annuity which they had agreed upon for Support of the Family, they
                                    continued paying it regularly to a Day.

                                    his Negroes assembled before his Door, and expressing their Concern, they offered him a
                                    large Sum of Money, which they had brought ready tied up on Bags bade of old Stockings, and
                                    said, if the Money was insufficient, they could borrow as much more among their Friends and
                                    Relations. What the Sum total was, the Gentleman did not know, because he declined accepting

                                    under some severe Affliction</ecda:anonPers>.—An irresistible Curiosity prompted him to enquire among the Plantation
                                    Slaves for one of the same Country, who might perform the Office of Interpreter: <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-occupation="linguist">A Female

                                    which no Answer was returned. The Man turned a deaf hear to her Expostulations, and seemed
                                    determined to maintain a sullen Silence. In the mean time <persName>Sir Charles</persName>, surveying the rest of

                                    Inquiries were therefore addressed to him, and from his Replies it was understood, that his
                                    disconsolate Companion had been a Cabocero, or Chief of a Village, in his own Country, possessed of

                                    touched with the Vicissitude of Fortune which had reduced the Chief from the State of such Elevation <!-- omg!!!! do the authors not see the insanity of this???? -->
                                    and Authority in his own Country, to be the Companion in Servitude of his own Slave. He
                                    immediately withdrew, sent for the Cabocero to his House, and having by means of a trusty Interpreter
                                    received a Confirmation of the Story from his own Mouth, he executed a Manumission, the

                                    of it, and then decide on the Humanity of forcing <name>Englishmen</name> to dig the Earth in any Part of

                                <p>The Thermometer stood in the Shade at 115°, and the Heat out of the Doors was too great

                                    and dangerous Species. It is true, we cannot adduce an Example directly in point, because it

                                    almost entirely Woodland), the Engineers, <persName>Colonel Lilly</persName>, perceiving that Twenty Negroes, who
                                    were then employed in clearing it, did not make that Progress in the Work which his Majesty's 
                                    Service required, prevailed upon Governor Hunger and Rear Admiral Stuart to consent that a
                                    large Detachment of Seamen, drawn from the Squadron on that Station, might be employed for
                                    that Purpose. <persName>Dr. Linde</persName> has recorded the Consequences of this Measure. There are (says this

                                    seized with a Fever and Delirium, The Phrenzy attacked a Man so suddenly, and with so much
                                    Fury, that with his Hatchet, if not prevented, he would have cut in Pieces the Persons who
                                    stood near him; and those who were seized in this Manner, and were left to remain on Shore,
                                    either died or suffered a dangerous Fit of Sickness. He gives several other Examples, and
                                    among the rest the following:

                                <p>At the Conclusion of the late Peace (<date when="1762">1762</date>), the Captain of a Ship of War went ashore at

                                    Ground, which he intended to have purchased; but in a few Days Sickness obliged them to 
                                    desist from this dangerous Work; the <emph>Captain himself</emph>, and <emph>Eleven</emph> out of his <emph>Twelve</emph> Assistants,
                                    being seized with violent Fevers, of which <emph>several died</emph>. This is an Occupation (says the humane
                                    Author) <emph>which has always proved destructive to <name>Europeans</name> in those Climates</emph>, and in which they
                                    ought never to be employed, especially in the rainy Season (<emph>which is the Season for planting)</emph>,
                                    there being numberless Instances of <emph>White Persons</emph>, when cutting down the Woods at that
                                    Season, who have been <emph>taken ill in the Morning</emph>, and died at Night. He adds, that if the
                                    purchasing of Negroes on the Coast of <placeName>Guinea</placeName> can be justified, it must be from the <emph>absolute
                                    Necessity</emph> there is for employing them instead of White Persons in such Services as these. Colonel

                                    that not only great Numbers of the common People, but <emph>above Twenty-two Officers</emph>, naval and 
                                    military perished by the Experiment at <placeName>Navy Island</placeName>; so that it may almost amount to a Question,
                                    Whether the selling of each Tree did not cost the Life of an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Subject? But it is hardly
                                    a Doubt, but that the same Climate and the same Labours were as malignant to the Bodies
                                    and Constitutions of Englishmen Two hundred Years ago as they are at present. Plantations
                                    have been settled in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> by the Subjects of <placeName>Spain</placeName>, <placeName>France</placeName>, <placeName>Britain</placeName>, <placeName>Holland</placeName>, and
                                    other Nations; but we have no one Evidence, either historical, traditional, or inductive, to 
                                    ascertain as a Fact, that at any Period of Time, from the First Discovery by <persName>Columbus</persName>, a signal
                                    Acre of Ground in that Part of the World has ever been laboured and planted with Sugar
                                    Cane by the Hands of White Men. The Notion, therefore, that <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>, or any other <rs type="properAdjective">West

                                    for the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> Islands in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and in the Returns made from the said Islands, to
                                    the Question concerning the Use of the Plough in the Cultivation of Sugar Plantations in the
                                    said Islands, the Committee examined <persName>John Ashley</persName>, Esq. (now of <placeName>Cookham</placeName>) who had been recommended 
                                    as a Person who had himself made Experiment of the Use of the Plough upon his
                                    Estate in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; and his Evidence is as follows:
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> was born in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, and inherited an Estate there, which himself converted into
                                    a Sugar Plantation. He made little use of the Plough until the latter Part of the Year <date when="1783">1783</date>.
                                    till which Time his Plantation never yielded more that 115 Tierces of Sugar. From the great
                                    Drought which they experienced in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the Year <date when="1782">1782</date>, the Crops were very small in the Years
                                    <date when="1783">1783</date> and <date when="1784">1784</date>; and <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> finding himself much incumbered, and fearing to run further in
                                    Debt for the Purchase of Negroes, he determined to make a more extensive Experiment of the
                                    Use of the Plough, and made the Experiment accordingly from <date when="1783-11">November 1783</date> to <date when="1784-05">May
                                    1784</date>. He opened fresh Land to enlarge his Plantation, and did it with the Plough; and the
                                    Consequence was, that with the same Strength of Negroes, without the Addition of One, he made
                                    about 235 Tierces of Sugar, double the Quantity he had made before—but <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> desired
                                    leave to observe, that they Year <date when="1785">1785</date> was a remarkably fine yielding Year. The Number of his
                                    Negroes (including his Children and infirm Negroes) was all this Time Ninety-six; of that Number
                                    he had Forty on his Field List, but seldom worked about Thirty-two at a Time.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> left the Island in <date when="1785-06">June 1785</date>, and wished the Use of the Plough to be continued
                                    on his Plantation, but finds it had not been done—his Overseer always makes Excuses,
                                    and says, it will interfere with the Use of the Cattle, which are wanted for Crop Time; but <persName>Mr.
                                    Ashley</persName> differs with him, as the Land may be ploughed in the latter Part of the Year before
                                    Crop Time begins. <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> is of opinion that Overseers have a Prejudice against the Use
                                    of the Plough, from Dislike to be driven out of their ancient Mode of Cultivation. Some few 
                                    of the Overseers purchase Negroes to let out to hire, and where that is they Case, it may be their
                                    Interest not to abridge the Labour of Slaves.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Asley</persName> being asked, Whether the Soil is not sometimes so dry as not to admit the Use of
                                    the Plough? replied, He never found it so—that he ploughed  in the Time of the greatest
                                    Drought—that his Plantation was situated in a very flat Country, subject to great Droughts, which
                                    make their Crops very precarious.
                                </p>
                                <p>Being asked, Whether the Ground is not sometimes too hilly or too stony for the Plough?
                                    he said, That in some Parts of the Island the Ground certainly is too hilly; but he has been
                                    told that the Farmer in this Country sometimes ploughs in the ground as steep as can well be 
                                    conceived. <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> cannot say but there may be Parts of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> too stony for the Plough.
                                </p>
                                <p>Being asked, If the very steep Ground is ever used as a Sugar Plantation, he said a great deal
                                    of very steep Ground is used for Sugar Plantations, and the surest Crops are on those Grounds, as
                                    they experience a more regular Succession of Seasons, from their Situation in the interior Part of
                                    the Island.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> being asked, Whether the Cattle in so hot a Climate bear the Labour well? replied,
                                    They certainly do bear it well, and added that his Cattle were in as good Order when he
                                    left off ploughing as when he began, for he always ploughs from Day-light to Nine o'Clock
                                    in the Morning, and in the Evening from Three o'Clock till Dark, by which means the Cattle
                                    and the Ploughmen rested during the Heat of the Day.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> was asked, what he conceived would be the Difference of Expence between 
                                    ploughing and holing and Acre for Canes? and replied, an Acre will employ Forty Negroes,
                                    on an Average of Soil a Day, to dig it fit for planting Canes; and a Jobber was paid in his
                                    Time 7l. Currency (equal to 5l. Sterling) for doing it. <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> broke up an Acre in a
                                    Day, working only at the Periods above-mentioned with Two Sets of Oxen, each Set consisting 
                                    of Eight Oxen (One for the Morning and One for the Evening) to One Plough; and it took
                                    him Half a Day more to put it in the same Order for planting the Canes, as the Land dug by
                                    Jobbers. But without the previous Operation of breaking up the Land (which Labour in many
                                    Souls may be spared) he has holed Two Acres a Day with Two Spells of Oxen to the Plough,
                                    and has found it answer full as well as Land holed by Negro Labour. The Land holed by
                                    Hand is never entirely broken up, there being an intermediate Space of Land which as not
                                    been dug, upon which they pull up the Earth out of the Holes.
                                </p>
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> is of opinion, founded upon Experience, that Land holed by the Plough is more
                                    likely to produce good Crops, than Land hoed by the Labour of Negroes, because the Ground 
                                    is more completely shaken by the Plough than by the Hoe. He cannot say at what Rate per Acre
                                    a Jobber would undertake to plough, as he never new an Acre ploughed by Job.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName>, though he generally ploughed with Oxen, sometimes put Two Horses as Leaders in
                                    the room of Two Oxen, and found them stand the labour as well as the oxen. Mules well
                                    trained would stand the Labour better than either.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> being asked whether his Estate produced as much since the Use of the Plough
                                    was discontinued as before when it was used? replied, It had not; but that might be owing to
                                    various Circumstances. He rather imputes the falling off to the Want of Rains, for although
                                    the Plough has not been made use of, there as been no Want of Labour, as he has purchased
                                    more Negroes, and has hired Jobbers occasionally, but his Expences therefore have been higher.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> observed that he wished here to explain that in part of the Island where his
                                    Estate is situated, the Labour is not so great as in many other Places, as the Canes will bear a
                                    Repetition of cutting for Eight or Ten Years, without re-holing or replanting the Land;
                                    whereas in some Estates situate in other Parts of the Island, One-third of the Sugar Land must
                                    be replanted every Year, not bearing to be cut above Twice, that is Once in Plant and Once in
                                    Rattoon. On these Estates, therefore, the Plough would be much more useful, than in that
                                    Part of the Island where his Property lies, provided they are not hilly Plantations. And <persName>Mr.
                                    Ashley</persName> is of opinion that the Stock employed in Grinding the Sugar Cane might be employed 
                                    as soon as the Crops are over, until they begin again (say Six Months Space at least) in ploughing
                                    the Land without the Addition of Stock upon the Plantation or Detriment to them.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> added, that he found the Negroes learn the Use of the Plough very readily,
                                    though at first the Negro set to Plough seemed to think it an Hardship on him, to do the Labour
                                    (as he termed it) of all the Field Negroes. But as it was necessary to have One Negro to drive
                                    the Oxen in the Plough, <persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> took care to have them trained to holding the Plough; so
                                    that in fact there were Two Ploughmen to One Plough; when the one was ploughing the other
                                    drove, and by changing their Situations relieved each other, so as to make the Labour light.
                                </p>
                                <p><persName>Mr. Ashley</persName> being asked, Whether he could state to the Committee the Quantity of Sugar is 
                                    Estate produced each Year? replied, that could be recollect the exact Quantity he had made
                                    each Year, and the Number of Slaves he possessed at each Period of Time from his first settling,
                                    it would be no manner of Use; for as he had already mentioned, the Seasons are so very
                                    precarious in the Part of the Island where his Estate is situated, that some Years they do not make 
                                    sufficient to pay the contingent Charges, and in others the Returns are ample.
