                <p>The Committee, in obedience to your Majesty's said Order of Reference, <!-- title?? -->
                    proceeded immediately to investigate the Subject so referred, and
                    examined such Persons as either offered themselves, or such as they
                    thought proper to summon, being in the Judgment of the Committee
                    likely to convey useful Information thereupon; and they applied to the

                    Majesty's Governors and the Councils and Assemblies of the said Islands;

                    for Anwers to such Questions as appeared in the Committee to be calculated
                    to produce Information on the several parts of this extensive
                    Subject. The Committee thought proper likewise to apply to your
                    Majesty's Ministers at Foreign Courts for such Information as they might
                    be able to procure concerning the State of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Trade as carried
                    on by Foreign Countries, and concerning the Manner of transporting

                    to be searched for all the Information to be found therein respecting
                    this Subject. They also called for, and obtained from the Public 
                    Offices and other Sources, such Accounts as appeared to them to be
                    likely to throw light upon any of the Heads of this Inquiry, and 
                    particularly upon the Extent and Value of this Trade in all its Branches,

                            <p>The People upon the Coast are wholly <name>Mahometans</name>; next to them, internally, there is
                                a Country containing a People called the <name>Sierrieurs</name>, who believe in a Supreme Being, and 
                                testify such Belief by shewing great Marks of Joy and Gratitude on occasion of any Behefits
                                received: they have no Idols, nor any Form of Worship; their principal Tenet is, that
                                they are to be happy in this World, and they endeavour to make themselves so, by every Species
                                of licentious Enjoyment, which they even pursue under Affliction. The Countries beyond
                                these are chiefly <name>Pagan</name>. The Country of the <name>Sierrieurs</name> is more populous, in proportion to
                                its Extent, than the Mahometan Countries; the Sierrieurs are governed by a Number of
                                independent Chiefs, but they have no Kings. These People are Wanderers, like the <name>Moors</name>,
                                but they wander only within the Limits of their own Country.

                            <p>The <name>Barras</name> are short and think, with thick Lips, flat Noses, and wooly Heads: They

                                their Children accordingly; they are wooly-headed, strong, short and thinck, and their Faces
                                are tattood; they are fond of War, and are very artful People.

                            <p>The <name>Wolloffs</name> are a sensible, hospitable, and civil People, but jealous and vindictive.</p>
                            <p>The People of <placeName>Tin</placeName> are serious in their Disposition, much oppressed by their King, and 
                                naturally jealous and vindictive.

                            <p>The <name>Barbessins</name> and the <name>Barras</name> are an artful People, much accustomed to Chicanery in
                                Trade, and perfidious in their Dealings; they are lively, jealous, and vindictive.
                            </p>
                            <p>The People in general are very indolent; the Men do nothing but smoke, shoot, and fish;
                                the Women do all the Work in the Field, as well as of the House. Every Man is allowed
                                to take as many Wives as he pleases, if he can satisfy the Marabou or Priest that he is
                                able to maintain them. The Wives are in general Slaves to the Husbands, and work very
                                hard.

                            resided in the <placeName>Isles de Los</placeName> and the <placeName>River Kissey</placeName> on the <placeName>Windward Coast</placeName> about Two Years,

                            of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, where <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has been, the Country is divided into a Number of petty
                            States, ruled by Kings or head Men, whose Districts are very small. The Power of these 
                            Kings or head Men is not absolute and arbitrary; and they generally call a Council consisting of
                            head Men, who are Relations of the Princes, in which all Matters, civil or military, are
                            decided. The religious Institutions of these petty States are principally <name>Pagan</name>; there
                            are some <name>Mahometans</name>, and on the Northern Rivers a few black <name>Christians</name>, made such by 
                            the <name>Portuguese</name> when they were established among them.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> being aksed, Whether the Black <name>Christians</name>, or the <name>Mahometans</name>, make any Converts?
                            replied, the <name>Mahometans</name> make a great many by force: There is a large warlike
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Country to the North-east of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>, called <placeName>Fula</placeName>, whose Inhabitants are
                            descended from <name>Arabs</name>; though of a darker colour, they have <rs type="properAdjective">Arab</rs> Features. The Poers
                            of this Country is employed in making Converts to <name>Mahometanism</name>; they have made a great
                            Progress in converting the People of the <placeName>Susa Country</placeName>, which is a Part of the Coast. The
                            Princes on the <placeName>Rivers Kissey</placeName> and <placeName>Malachurry</placeName>, which are also a Part of this Coast, are Tributaries
                            to the Fula King;  and in thes Two last Countries great Progress has been made in
                            <name>Mahometanism</name>, and is still making. The Black <name>Christians</name> do not attempt to make any
                            Converts; they are an obscure Sort of People, and mix <name>Paganism</name> with the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Religion.
                            The <persName>King of <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName></persName> sent on of his <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-religion="mohametan">Sons</ecda:persGroup> in <date when="1769">1769</date> to the <placeName>Fula Country</placeName> to learn
                            <name>Mahometanism</name>, and <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-religion="christian">another</ecda:anonPers> to <placeName>Lancaster</placeName> to learn the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Relgion; the latter turned out very
                            profligate. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has seen in that Country several <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> Teachers come down with
                            Transcripts from the <rs type="title">Khoran</rs>, to whom they pay great Respect. These Men are sometimes
                            employed in instructing the Youth of the Country in the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabic</rs> Language and in the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> 
                            Religion, and with great Success, and they are in general devout; but notwithstanding
                            their Devotion, the <name>Europeans</name> do not find either their Lives or Properties so safe in the
                            <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Towns as in those where <name>Paganism</name> prevails. The <name>Pagans</name> are humble and submissive;
                            the <name>Mahometans</name> are proud and insolent.

                            whose Manners and Governments are nearly similar, about five Days Journey inland, where 
                            the <name>Europeans</name> have been longest settled, and possess the greates Number of Forts, Civilization
                            has improved beyond any thing he has discovered in any other Country of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and the
                            People have Civil Rights arising from traditionary Laws and Customs; but, even in this
                            Coutnry, much remains to be done towards Civilization. The Bussou and Craba, the confidential
                            Man and favourate Woman, of every Person of Distinction are usually put to Death
                            and interred him.: The imputed Crime of Witchcraft is still believed there, and is
                            punished with Transportation.</said>—By Transportation, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> means, selling them to the White
                            Traders, which is represented in this Nation as the greatest Evil that can befal them, in order
                            to deter them from Crimes. The superior State of Civilization in this Country, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>
                            imputes to their Intercourse with <name>Europeans</name>; and added—Report says, that formerly a much
                            greater Number were but to Death, and interred with their deceased Lords.
                        </p>
                        <p><name>Paganism</name> is universal.—By <name>Paganism</name>, <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> means, the Worship of those Objects which
                            strike the Senses.—At <placeName>Whyday</placeName>, a Snake is the principal Object of their Worship; and, besides
                            this, Trees, Caverns, and Amulets round their Necks which are furnished by their Priests.
                            At <placeName>Cape Coast</placeName>, the Rocks on which the Fort is built is their Tutelar Deity. A Tyger is the
                            immediate Object of the <persName>King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>'s</persName> Worship.

                            Twleve Years on the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>; was Governor at <placeName>Whyday</placeName> Eleven Years, and the other
                            at <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName>: he left the Coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName> in <date when="1763">1763</date>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The States upon the Coast are small, but larger in the interior Country. As to the Religious
                            Institutions, the People worship the Sun, the Sea, Thunder and Lightning, Lakes, &amp;c. The
                            Snake was the peculiar Worship of the ancient People of <placeName>Whyday</placeName>, and then this Province was
                            conquered by the <placeName>King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName></placeName>, the Worship of the Snake was continued upon Motives
                            of Policy. Formerly, a Person who killed a Snake was put to Death; but now a Goat is sacrificed
                            as an Atonement.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> doubts whether a Tyger is the Object of Worship of the King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>,
                            But says it is an Animal esteemed royal, and it is not to be killed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Respecting the Civil Rights of the People, <persName>Mr. Devaynes</persName> says—They enjoy Civil Rights
                            and Privileges that are of more ancient Date than our Settlement among them.—He does not
                            believe that the Natives are much improved in their Morals by their Intercourse with the
                            <name>Europeans</name>; on the contrary, he thinks that the worst Blacks are those who have been the most 
                            concerned with the Whites; their Manners and Dress are in some Degree improved thereby.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Miles</persName>, being asked, What is in general the Nature of the Government on the Coast of

                            which extends from <placeName>Cape Le Hou</placeName> to the <placeName>River Volta</placeName>, with which Part of the Coast he is best

                        <p>On the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, he knows but of one despotic Government, which is at <placeName>Cape Appollonia</placeName>,
                            the most Western <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Settlement: There the King is absolute; the Monarchy is hereditary 
                            in the male Issue of the female Line; the Country is large and Populous. Every other 
                            Part of the <placeName>Gold Goast</placeName> is divided into various petty States, governed by very limited
                            Monarchs: The Government consists, first, of the King; then of the Elders, who are rarely chosen
                            till they have arrived at the Age of Sixty: Upon the Death of any one of them, the Body of
                            these Elders recommends a Successor to the King, who usually confirms the Choice they have
                            made. The third Estate is composed of Captains of the Troops or Town Soldiers, chosen by
                            the People at large, and removable at their Pleasure. These Countries, so governed, are for the
                            most Part populous.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Miles</persName> cannot give any Information respecting the States bordering inland on the <placeName>Gold
                            Coast</placeName>, or concerning the interior Countries of <placeName>Africa</placeName>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Inhabitants are <name>Pagans</name>, and have different material Objects of Worship, such as Rivers,
                            Rocks, and various Idols; to which, on particular Ocassions, they sacrifice Sheep and Goats;
                            and sometimes they make human Sacrifices, of which (though very much discouraged by 
                            <name>Europeans</name>, and therefore practised in secret) <persName>Mr. Miles</persName> has had ocular Demonstration. They
                            recalled Sophas, whose Persons are on all Occasions sacred.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether the People are a moral People, and appear to have a due Sense of
                            Right and Wrong?—He replied—In their intercourse and Dealings with each other, they are
                            very exact and strict; they are punished with the Loss of Liberty for the smallest Theft, and
                            all other Crimes; they have a faint Idea of a future State.

                            upon the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> was Governor of <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName> from <date from="1778" to="1780">1778 to 1780</date>. In
                            tthe Month of <date when="1780-12">December 1780</date>, he became Governor of <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName>, and continued so
                            till <date when="1782-04">April 1782</date>, returned to <placeName>Annamaboe</placeName> in <date when="1782-05">May 1782</date>, and continued there as Governor
                            till his Return to <placeName>England</placeName> in <date when="1784-01">January 1784</date>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is divided into a Number of small Governments, principally consisting of
                            limited Monarchies.
                        </p>
                        <p>The People are all <name>Pagans</name>; they worship the Moon, which is one of their greatest
                            Deities, and Rocks and other Visible Objects. They appear to have a Sense of a supernatural
                            Being, and of a future State, and this they shew by the Sacrifices they make at the Death of
                            their principal People, when they sacrifice some of the Slaves belonging to the deceased, or 
                            others whom they purchase for that Purpose. The Number sacrificed is in Proportion to the
                            Rank of the deceased. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> never saw any of these sacrifices, but has seen the poor 
                            Victims parading about, Two or Three days before they were to be sacrificed, they did not
                            appear to be dejected, but quite the contrary they were dressed out. It was not customary 
                            for <name>Europeans</name> to go to these Ceremonies, and <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> rather thinks the Natives would
                            have made Objections. The <name>Europeans</name> have always endeavoured to prevent this, but the
                            People have a superstitious Idea, that the Manes of the deceased would not be satisfied unless
                            these Sacrifices were made. <persName>Mr. Weuves</persName> was not near enough to observe whether the Victims
                            appeared to be intoxicated as a Fact, but conceives they had given them Spirits.

                        <p>The <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName> is divided into a Number of petty States, governed by Chiefs or Caboceers.
                            They suppose that an ideal Being, called Braffoe, superintends all these States; and this
                            Being they consult by means of their Priests or <distinct>Fetiche Men</distinct>. These Caboceers have each
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            their particular Vassals, but they have not such absolute Power over them as to be able to
                            dispose of them without the Consent of their Fellow Vassals, or the Pynims or Elders of the
                            Town. The Caboceers have no Power over the Lives and Property of their Vassals, except
                            in consequence of Trial, which is before these Pynims or Elders.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> has not observed that the People on this Coast are more civilized than in
                            other Parts of <placeName>Africa</placeName>; they are more hardy and more turbulent.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Religion is <name>Paganism</name>, and the Objects of their Worship are various, but chiefly
                            sensible Objects; it is so unintelligible, that it is extremely difficult to give any Account of it.
                            The Fisherman of <placeName>Cape Coast Castle</placeName> worship the Rock on which the Castle stands; and when
                            they cross the <placeName>River Volta</placeName> they throw a Bottle of Rum into it to secure them a favourable
                            Passage and safe Return. They have various Superstitions with respect to Food, some 
                            eating one Sort only, and some another.

                        <p>Of the Countries bordering on the <placeName>Gold Coast</placeName>, the Kingdom of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> is the largest,
                            governed by the most absolute Tyrant that exists on Earth. <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, where the <name>English</name>,
                            <name>French</name> and <name>Portugueze</name>, have Forts, is a Province belonging to the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="monarch">Monarch</ecda:anonPers>, having been
                            conquered by his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">Grandfather</ecda:anonPers> about Sixty Years ago. In <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> there is not individual
                            Freeman, except the King. The King is absolute Master of the Lives and Properties
                            of his Subjects, and he sports with their Lives in the most wanton and savage
                            Manner. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> has seen at the Gates of his Palace Two Piles of Heads, like Shoe in
                            an Arsenal; within the Palace, the Heads of Persons newly put to death are strewed at
                            the Distance of a few yeards in the Passage that leads to the Apartment of the Tyrant, in
                            order to inspire the Person who is to be admitted to an Audience  with Awe and Terror,
                            <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> does not speak of One particular Tyrant; it is the Custom of the Country on 
                            great Occasions, such as the Reception of Messengers from neighbouring States, or of White
                            Merchants, and in general on Days of Ceremonial; but the great Carnage is once a Year,
                            when the Poll Tax is paid by his Subjects. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot exactly say how many are
                            executed in this Manner in the Course of the Year, but speaks within Compass when he
                            reckons them at a Thousand. This is the Custom of the Monarchy, and this Power extends
                            over his whole Dominions. The Kingdom is very populous and runs about 350 Miles
                            inland. The Roof of the Palace is decorated with a prodigious Number of human Heads;
                            and when the King means to make War, it is an Expression in use to say, <distinct rend="italic">The Palace wants <!-- @type here?? -->
                            Thatching</distinct>. The great Men of the Coutnry cut off a few Heads in these Festivals, which is 
                            a Part ontly of the same Ceremonial, and the Victims are taken from those destined for
                            Execution by the King. Parents have no Sort of Property in their Children in the <rs type="properAdjective">Dahoman</rs>
                            Territories; the Children belong entirely to the King, and are taken by his Order from their
                            Mothers at an early Age, and distributed in Villaged remote from the Place of their Nativity,
                            where there is but little Chance of their being seen, or at least recongized by their Parents
                            afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Motive of this is, that there may be no Family Connections or Combinations, no
                            Associations that might be injurious to the King's unlimited Power.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each Individual is detached and unconnected, and, having no Relatives for whom he
                            is interested, is solicitous only for his own Safety, which he consultes by the most abject 
                            Submission and Obedience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here paternal Affection and filial Love scarcely exist; for Mothers, instead of cherishing,
                            endeavour to suppress those Attachments for their Offspring, which they are certain will be
                            violated as soon as their Children are able to undergo the Fatigue of being removed from
                            them.

                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> added, He should be sorry that Facts so extraodinary should rest on his
                            Assertion only, and referred hiself to <persName>William Devaynes</persName> Esquire, formerly Governor of
                            the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Fort and <placeName>Whyday</placeName>, who had been in this Country likewise.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether the Persons, executed as before mentioned, are taken
                            without Choice and at Random, and whether they have undergone any Form of Trial?
                            replied, On these Occasions the Slave Holes (by which he means a strong Room in every
                            Slave-merchant's House) are ransacked, and the Sweepings of them, that is the Slaves rejected
                            by the White Men, furnish a Part of these public Executions, which consist besides of
                            Prisoners taken in War, and Delinquents. These Person are carried before a Magistrate and
                            undergo a Sort of Trial. There is no particuplar Time when the Slave Holes are fuller than
                            at others; the Slaves are brought in at different Times and sold as Occasion offers; the
                            Trade is always going on except in War. Being asked, Whether the Inhabitants of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>
                            are taken for these public Executions without having had some Delinquency previously imputed
                            to them? he replied, Those who have not been accused of any Crime are liable to be
                            induced in the public Executions, when Delinquents, or Captives taken in War do not
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            supply a sufficient Number: Notwithstanding this, the People of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> never quit the
                            Country; with an Extraordinary Submission, they revere the Name of their Sovereign, and
                            never mention it in their most private Apartments without kneeling; such is the Force of 
                            Education and Habit. At <placeName>Abomey</placeName>, One of the Royal Residences, there are Twenty-five thousand
                            Inhabitants, and at <placeName>Calmina</placeName>, the other Royal Residence, about Sixteen Thousand.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked, Whether if there were no People of the Description before mentioned, the
                            innocent Inhabitants of Dahomey would be put to death on these Occasions? he replied,
                            There is no Doubt, in such Case they would particularly on the great annual Ceremony,
                            diminish the Number of these Sacrifices. If the King is in want of European Goods,
                            the Number of Executions is smaller; if he is overstocked with Powder, Arms, and <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
                            Goods, not wanting Slaves for purchase of them, he puts to Death a greater Number; as
                            it is considered as Part of his Power and Magnificence to make a great Slaughter on this
                            Occasion, and it is celebrated accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Norris</persName> being asked, Whether the Prisoners of War are always made Slaves, or are
                            sometimes put to death? replied, in consequence of a War that was going on when he was
                            there, 1500 Prisoners were made, many of whom were offered to him. which he declined
                            purchasing, as they appeared unhealty. The <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="king" a-gender="male">King</ecda:anonPers> thereupon told him, since that was the 
                            Case, he would put them to death. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> advised him against it, and recommended to
                            him to make them Salt Boilers, as they came from the Country that supplied him with Salt, 
                            or to employ them in some other Way; but the King replied, it would be setting a bad 
                            Example, and bringing People into the Country who would hold seditious Language. That
                            his was a peculiar Government, and that these strange People might prejudice his Subjects
                            against it, and infect them with Sentiments incomparable with it. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> cannot say what
                            became of these Prisoners; has no Doubt but many sound Purchasers, but imagines the rest
                            were put to death. <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> believes it to be the general Practice in <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> to put the
                            Prisoners of War to death unless they are sold.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Treatment of Strangers, Whites or Blacks, on coming into the Territory
                            of this Prince, Mr. Norris says, the Whites are treated with greater Civility and Attention
                            than in any other Country in Africa. They are provided with Houses and Provisions 
                            on their Journey at the King's Expence, The travelling Arabs, called malayes, are also
                            treated with great Respect; and the Black Messengers from neighbouring States are treated
                            with Attention, and are protected. Being aksed, Whether upon the Arrival of any White
                            Trader in the Captial of the Kindom, these Executins take place, and to what Extent?
                            Mr. Norris said, he never saw less than Six decollated Heads strewed in the Passage leading to
                            the King's apartment when he has been there.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris being asked, Whether he knew any Thing of the Countires bordering on Dahomey,
                            particularly inland? replied, He did, and from Accounts he had heard from Hundreds 
                            of People, the Government of Eyo is the same. He cannot say from his own Knowledge 
                            what becomes of Prisoners and Delinquents in the Eyo Country, but believes they are treated
                            as they are at Dahomey. The Eyo Slave Merchant sells his Slaves to the Slave Dealers
                            of Dahomey. The latter has submitted to pay Tribute to Eyo, and there has not been any
                            War between them for a Period of Thirty or Forty Years past. Mahee, on the other Side of 
                            Dahomey, is a Union of confederate States, and a Species of Republic. It is a Sort of feudal
                            Government; the leading Men have Vassals or Slaves, but they do not treat them in the same 
                            savage Way in which they are treated at Dahomey. The Governors or Leading Men at
                            Mahee sell their Slaves in great Numbers, as well as the Traders of Eyo, to the Dahomey
                            Factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Norris's Account of the Government, Manners, and Customs, of Dahomey and Whydah
                            having been read to Mr. Devaynes, and the Question put to him, How far that Account
                            agreed with what might have fallen withinhis own Observation? Mr. Devaynes differed with
                            Mr. Norris in Opinion in sme Particulars as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Respecting the Executions, and the making Human Sacrifices on certain Days of Ceremony,
                            Mr. Devaynes in general confirms the Account diven by Mr. Norris, but observes,
                            that the Performance of the Ceremony of Human Sacrifices does not take place on Occasion
                            of the Payment of the Poll Tax (which does not exist), but when the King buries his Father
                            and Mother again (as the Ceremony is called), which is generally about Crhistmas. On this
                            Occasion, about Sixty Men and Women, besides all Kinds of Animals, are put to death, and
                            sent to the deceased, in order that he or she may remain quiet, and not trouble the King; Promise
                            is made by a Cryer, in the Name of the King, that these Sacrifices shall be continued:
                            The Riches of the King are carried, covered, in Procession, in which the King's Women
                            (sometimes to the Amount of Three Thousand) appear: Goods are distributed to the Populace,
                            which are thrown from a high Platform to be scrambled for. Mr. Devaynes attended Ten of
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            these Ceremonies himself. The King lives in his Palace, which stands on a Space of near Three
                            Miles, attended only by Women, some of whom are armed. The King's Great Officers crawl
                            towards him, rubbing their Faces on the Ground, and never rise in his Presence.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to what is stated by Mr. Norris, that these Executions take Place on the Arrival of
                            any White Trader, Mr. Devaynes says, that White People are treated with great Respect; but he
                            is of Opinion, that Mr. Norris must have been at Dahomey at the Time of the Ceremony of 
                            watering the Graves. Mr. Devanes has occasionally, on visiting the King, seen Two or Three
                            Heads lying in the Palace, but does not think the Number of Persons put to Death in his Time
                            was near so many as is mentioned by Mr. Norris. These consisted of Persons sacrificed on Occasion
                            of the Ceremony of watering the Graves of the King's Ancestors; or Prisoners taken in War;
                            or of Delingquents of Note. If a Man happens to fall down on the Space before the King's
                            Palace, which may be about 400 or 500 Yards, they cut his Head off immediately, as they suppose
                            he must have some disloyal Thoughts in his Head to make him fall on level Ground. All
                            Messengers going to and from the King constantly run.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Persons destined for the Executions having undergone any Form of Trial,
                            Mr. Devaynes does not believe that tye do undergo any Sort of Trial, though there may be
                            some sort of Examination. When the Queen's Mother died, he was present when One of the
                            great Officers was taken to be put to Death in order to wait upon her as a Mark of Respect. He
                            does not recollect that any one of the King's great Officers, during the Time he was there, died a
                            natural Death. When the King wishes to get rid of One of them, he says to his Colleagues, what
                            he does not like his Face, or wish to see him again, which is the Expression used, as that of Blood
                            or Death is always avoided in Presence of the King. In consequence of this they take care to put
                            him to Death. There is nothing these People will not do to get into Office, notwithstanding the
                            almost absolute Certainty of Death attending it. They are a happy People, and have greaat
                            Contempt for the Subjects of the neighbouring Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Reason assigned by Mr. Norris, why the Number of Human Sacrifices
                            is sometimes diminished viz. that if the King of Dahomey is overstocked with Powder and other
                            Articles, not wanting Slaves for the Purchase of themn, he puts to Death a greater Number,
                            considering it as Part of his Power and Magnificence; Mr. Devaynes does not think it possible
                            to ascertain the Motives the King may have for putting his Subjects to Death. He believes
                            that when the King wants Eupopean Goods, he sometimes seizes Part of a Village and sells them
                            for Slaves under some frivolous Pretence or other; his Subjects do not however consider this as
                            any great Hardship, as they are all his Slaves and Property,
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to Prisoners of War being always put to Death unless sold for Slaves, Mr. 
                            Devaynes observed that in War the old, the lame, and the wounded are often put to Death
                            on the Spot, to save the Trouble of bringing them away; the young and the healthy, if not
                            immediately sold, are kept for another market, and are sometimes used as House Slaves. The
                            Women Prisoners are never put to Death, but when not sold, are always used as House Slaves.

                        <p>The Nature of the Government at <placeName>Whydah</placeName>, which is a Province conquered by the King of
                            <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>, and governed by a Viceroy, is despotic in the highest Degree. With respect to any civil
                            Rights enjoyed by the People of this Country, there are certain <distinct rend="italic" type="ethnographic">Customs</distinct> which <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> believes
                            the King of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> would not willingly break through, although he has the Power: He consults 
                            with One or Two of his principal Men, but is in general Master of the Lives and Property of his
                            Subjects. At their Death, their Wives, Property, and all go to the King; but he sometimes
                            restores it to those of the Family whom he finds meritorious.
                        </p>
                        <p>The King, in order to maintain his Authority over his Subjects, at the End of every Year,
                            makes what they call <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>. At this Period the Governors of the respective Provinces of the
                            Kingdom are called to the Capital, and their Conduct examined into: If they have behaved ill
                            they are punished, generally with Death; if well, they are dismissed with Presents. Upon this
                            Occasion the Governors of the Three Forts. viz. <name>French</name>, <name>English</name>, and <name>Portuguese</name>, are invited.
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> attended as Governor of the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Fort in order to pay the King the annual Present
                            of the <orgName>African Committee</orgName>, consisting of <ecda:commodity>Silk</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Brandy</ecda:commodity> &amp;c. to the Value of about 50L for which
                            he makes a Return of nearly the same Value, which is generally a Slave, and some of the Manufactures
                            of the Country. He is also very liberal to all their Attendants; they are lodged in their
                            Passage to the Capital by the King's Order, and in an House set apart for them at the Capital.
                            During his Stay there, which has sometimes been for three Weeks or upwards, <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> had
                            Opportunities of observing the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct>, which he explained as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>Every Fourth Day is their Market Day, and may perhaps be called their Sunday, for it is a Day
                            of Rest and Recreation, and of superstitious Ceremony.  On these Days during the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> there is
                            always some Kind of publick Exhibition going on. For instance, One Day is set apart for the
                            killing of Cattle, which Day in general is a Day previous to the Market Day. The <ecda:food>Meat</ecda:food>, being 
                            in very large Quantity, is dressed by the King's Women, and a large Quantity of the <ecda:food>Beer</ecda:food> of the

                            The Meat and Drink is put into clean Baskets, covered with a Cloth, and carried about on the
                            Market Day in Procession by the Women, dressed in their best Cloaths; it is then distributed to
                            the Publick; every one that pleases may come and eat and drink. A large Camp is pitched for
                            the principal Men, who eat a Portion of the above Provision apart from the common People.
                        </p>
                        <p>On another of these Market Days the diversion consists in Singing and Dancing, ant which the
                            Governors of the Forts, the King, and principal People attend. There are professed Singers,
                            whose Songs are extempore, generally in Prase of the King's warlike Exploits; and when he
                            is pleased, he makes the Singers a Present of a Bunch of Cowries; and when very much pleased,
                            as on one Occasion <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> saw him, he made the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="performer">Performer</ecda:anonPers> a Present of a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Woman</ecda:anonPers> with
                            a <ecda:anonPers>Child</ecda:anonPers> at her Back.

                        <p>Another of these market Days is allotted to the Distribution of Presents. A large Stage is  <!-- not sure if I should make the person at the end of this ¶ an anonPers? -->
                            erected contiguous to the King's House, covered with the Cloths of the Country, and adorned with
                            Flags and Umbrellas. A Fence of Thorns is placed round the Stage at some little Distance to
                            keep of the Rabble. The Stage is laoded with a Profusion of Cowries, Manufactures of the
                            Country, and European Goods. At a certain Time the King appears and orders his different
                            Viceroys, according to their Rank, to chuse a Piece of <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Cloth, or the Cloth of the
                            Country, together with a String of large Coral; which done, the King takes a Bunch of Cowries
                            with his own Hands, and throws to the Rabble beyond the Fence. The <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Governors,
                            And the other upon the Stage, follow the King's Example, and throw the Whole among the People 
                            who scramble for it, and carry away what they can get; after this, a Man tied, an <ecda:fauna>Alligator</ecda:fauna>
                            tied, a pair of <ecda:fauna>Pigeons</ecda:fauna> also tied, were thrown from the Stage; all of which, as <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> was
                            informed, were put to Death by the People below.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the whole of the <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> always found, upon going to the King's House,
                            Heads that appeared to have been fresh cut off; and he has seen, perhaps, about Twenty of those
                            Victims at a Time, previous to their Execution, whom he conceives to have been Men who had
                            been made Prisoners of War or Slaves.—These were tied to Stakes, and exhibited for a Day or
                            more before their execution, which he presumes was done in the Night. He has been desired to
                            go and see it, but never would. He has enquired into the Reason ofthese Executions, and though
                            the People are reserved on this Subject, het he has been told, that they have an Idea of a future
                            of the King in another World; and these Victims are so resigned to their Fate, that <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName>
                            himself observed One of them who was tied to the Stake make Efforts to dance at the Sound of
                            the Music; and he cannot say, as far as he observed, that they appeared to be intoxicated. They
                            also sacrifice <ecda:fauna>Horses</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>Mules</ecda:fauna> on the same Occasion, and probably with the same View.
                        </p>
                        <p>These <distinct rend="italic">Customs</distinct> are repeated once a Year only; and <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> does not know that any but
                            the King performs this Ceremony. He cannot speak as to the Number of People sacrificed on these
                            Occasions, but conceives it to be considerable; he has also seen Numbers of Skulls on the Top of
                            the King's Palace, and also on the Pavement of it. No Subject ventures to approach the King
                            without giving Notice by one of the Eunuchs, of whom there are Ten or Twelve, or by one of 
                            the King's Women, of which there are not so few as Two Thousand. When admitted to his
                            Presence, they approach groveling on their Hands and Knees, and throwing Dust over their Heads,
                            His principal Ministers do the same. When Europeans  or Messengers from the Foreign Countires
                            approach the King, they are allowed to salute him according to the Manner of their respective
                            Countries. Every Stranger carries a Linguist, but that Linguist is obliged to communicate what
                            is said to one of the Ministers who is always present, as it is below the Dignity of the King to
                            take Words from the Mouth of the Linguist. The distinguishing Part of the King's Dress is
                            wearing Sandals. There are Centinels at the outward Doors of the Palace which is a vast Wall of
                            Mud; inclosing a Space as big as <placeName>St. James's Park</placeName>; but no Male is allowed to reside within the
                            Walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Religion of the People at <placeName>Whydah</placeName> and the general Object of their Worship,
                            <persName>Mr. Dalzell</persName> observed that in no Part of <placeName>Africa</placeName> had be been able to understand the Religion of the
                            Natives. At <placeName>Whydah</placeName> they pay a Kind of Veneration to a particular Species of large Snake, which
                            is very gentle. In <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> they pay the same Kind of Veneration to Tygers. This Veneration
                            does not prevent People from catching and killing them if they please, but they must not touch
                            the Beard, which is considered a great Offence. They have a great Number of Men they call
                            <distinct type="religious" rend="italic">Fetiche</distinct> Men, or Padres. The Word Fetiche is derived from a <rs type="properAdjective">Portugueze</rs> Word meaning
                            Witchcraft.

                        <p>The Government of <placeName>Bonny</placeName> extends only over the Town, and a small District on each Side the
                            River. It is a Monarchy elective and not hereditary. The Election is made out of One of the
                            Families of Royal Blood. It is a limited Monarchy, and no Resolution of consequence is
                            taken, either in civil or military Matters, respecting Peace or War, but by the Advice of a
                            Council composed of the Principal People of the Country, of which Two are Priests. At the
                            Coronation of the King, One of these Priests with other religious Ceremonies, places the Cap,
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            which is a Symbol of Royalty, on his Head. The Priests do not take their own Names, but the
                            Name of the Deity whose Priests they are, and the Natives swear by them. They are not suffered
                            to trade, but ar supported by Government. They live in a separate Town, which is a Sanctuary
                            and Place of Refuge for Griminals and Debtors. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> was at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> at the Time of a 
                            contested Election for a King, and after some Contest, the defeated Party took Refuge there from
                            the Resentment of the prevailing one. They hold the <ecda:fauna>Guana</ecda:fauna>, a Species of Lizard, sacred at
                            <placeName>Bonny</placeName>. They offer human Sacrifices to the Manes of their King. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> was present at a
                            Ceremony of this Sort, where <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved">a young Slave</ecda:anonPers> was sacrificed with great Pomp, and with other
                            Animals. To give a further Sanction to the Measures taken, there are Twelve old Men, who
                            are appointed by the King and Nobles, and are generally consulted. These are called <orgName>Parliament
                            Gentlemen</orgName>. Disputes that arise in Matters of Trade between the Whites and Blacks, are
                            generally referred to these old Men.
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to the Government of the Countries adjoining to <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> can only speak 
                            from Report. No <name>European</name> has ever resided at <placeName>Bonny</placeName> on Shore, or been there, except on Ship
                            board for the Purpose of Trade. In the Country on the Sea Coast to the Eastward of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>,
                            called <placeName>Andomey</placeName>, the Government and Laws are similar to those of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>. To the Westard in
                            the Country called <placeName>Creek</placeName>, the People are considered as barbarous, and held in Abhorrence by
                            their Neighbours, as they are charged with being Cannibals. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> does not know what the
                            Government there is; the interior Part of the Country from whence the Bulk of the Slaves are
                            received, and which is of vast Extent, called <placeName>Ebo</placeName>, and another Country bordering on it to the
                            East, called <placeName>Ebibee</placeName>, from the concurrent Testimony of the best informed Traders who have been
                            in that Country, are divided into a Number of petty States, governed by despotic Princes independent
                            of each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being aksed, Whether the Subjects of Ebo and Ebibee have any civil Rights? Mr. Penny
                            replied, The Princes are despotic, and have the Command of the Lives and Properties of all
                            their Subjects, excepting only those of their own Family.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Religion of these Countries is idolatrous. In their Houses they have Idols of different
                            Sorts, some representing Men, and some Animals. They have no <name>Mahometans</name> amongst them.
                            <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> conceives that they belive in a future state, and in a good an bad Supreme Deity,
                            with a Number of inverior Deities under them. They place at the End of every Town a small
                            Quantity of Provision and Water as an Offereing to the bad Deity; and when they commit any
                            bad Action, they impute it to the bad Deity, who they say took Possession of them. This 
                            Account applies principally to the interior Country, but at <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, the Religion is nearly similar,
                            except that the Priests have amuch greater Influence there than in the interior Country.
                        </p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Penny</persName> attributes it to their Intercourse with the Europeans, that the Governments on the
                            Coast appear to be in general more free than in the interior Country; the only Exceptions thereto,
                            are the Countries of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> and <placeName>Benin</placeName>, which extend to the Sea Coast. He has observed, that
                            in the monarchical Governments, where there is a stronger Government to protect them, the Lives
                            and the Properties of Strangers are more secure than in the Republics.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government of <placeName>New Calabar</placeName> is nearly similar to that of <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, except that the King is
                            a mere Pageant. The Power chiefly resides in the principal Traders, who govern very much in
                            the King's Name. There is <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="male">a Man</ecda:anonPers> there called <distinct rend="italic">Anachree</distinct>, who has more Influence and Wealth
                            than all the rest of the Community, though he himself is a purchased Slave brought from the
                            <placeName>Braspan Country</placeName>; he has offered the Price of a hundred Slaves for his Freedom, but, according
                            to the Laws of the Country he cannot obtain it, though <ecda:anonPers>his Master</ecda:anonPers>, who is an obscure, and a poor
                            Individual, would gladly let him have it. It is contrary to a fundamental Law of the Country that
                            a purchased Slave should become free, and the Priests, who are Interpreters and Guardians of the
                            Laws are afraid, if it should be permitted in the Case of this Man, of establishing a dangerous
                            Precedent. It is a small Country and they are apprehensive that the purchased Slaves, if emancipated, 
                            should make themsleves Masters of it. Notwithstanding the great Influence and Wealth
                            of this Man, his Power is, in many Instances, restrained by his Condition of Slavery.

                            they began to trade for Slaves, and completed their Cargo. In the second Voyage wend and slaved

                            of any except the <placeName type="properAdjective">India</placeName> Trade, and in respect of Gain to himself might have obtained the Summit
                            of his Wishes, but declined it from Conviction of the Trade being unjust.

                        <p>Of the Government of this Country, <persName>Captain Hall</persName> gives the following Account.</p>
                        <p>The Business of the Town at the <placeName>River Del Rey</placeName> appeared to be managed by the old Men.
                            They had a <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King</ecda:anonPers>, who was absolute, but he always availed himself of the Advice of these <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-occupation="council">old
                            Men</ecda:persGroup>, who were his Council.
                        </p>
                        <p>At <placeName>Calabar</placeName> they had Three Kings, one of which had the Civil Government, the other was at the
                            Head of the Religion, and the third at the Head of the Law. Private Disputes were settled by
                            the Head of the Law. Matters of Greater Consequence were settled by the Three Kings with the
                            Elders of the Country. They have no written Law.
                        </p>
                        <p>They have no Money in this Country; Copper Rods about Fifteen Inches long are substituted
                            for Money. They have no Taxes, and no Army. They never were in actual War while he was
                            there, but he saw them making Preparation for War, either to resist Encroachments, or against
                            their Rivals in Trade, which consists of Slaves and a little <ecda:commodity>Ivory</ecda:commodity>. He does not believe any Wars
                            are entered into upon the Sea Coast for the Purpose of making Slaves. In the Year <date when="1768">1768</date>, there
                            was a very violent War, and the Slaves made in it were all either sold or massacred, and none remained in
                            the Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Cause of this violent War was this: There was a New Town on the River Calabar, settled
                            from the Old Town. This Town became considerable, and grew to be a Rival in Trade to the
                            Old Town. In the Year <date when="1786">1786</date>, there were Seven Ships which lay at the Point which separated the
                            Two Towns. The Two of these belonged to <placeName>London</placeName>, and the other Five to <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. Trade
                            was very slack, and hardly any Slaves were to be purchased, from the Jealousy that subsisted between
                            the Two Towns, which made it unsafe for Parties to go into the Country. The Captains
                            of the <placeName type="properAdjective">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName type="properAdjective">Bristol</placeName> Ships agreed to invite on board their Ships the People of both Towns,
                            in order to bring about a Reconciliation; at the same Time they entered into an Agreement with
                            the People of the New Town to cut off all the Old Town People the Day they met on board. So
                            perfectly satisfied were the Old Town People of the Sincerity of the Captains of the Ships to bring
                            about a Reconciliation, that the <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King of the Old Town</ecda:anonPers> gave his <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Daughter</ecda:anonPers> to <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female">Wife</ecda:anonPers> to the principal
                            Trader of the New Town. The next Morning at Eight o'Clock, one of the Ships fired a Gun
                            as a Signal to the others, when the Crews on board the other Ships made an Attempt to secure
                            all the Old Town People; those who resisted were put to Death by the Captains and Seamen of
                            the Ships.—Immediately after the Firing commenced, the New Town Canoes, which were lying
                            in Ambush behind the Point, came forward, and took up those who had jumped overboard, belonging
                            to the Old Town. After this the New Town People went along-side the different Ships,
                            Four of Which delivered up the Prisoners they had made to the New Town Canoes. The principal
                            Men of Old Town were put to Death in the Canoes by the New Town People; the lower
                            Class Prisoners were sold to the Ships as Slaves. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="captain">One Captain</ecda:anonPers>, who had secured <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male">Two of the
                            King's Brothers</ecda:persGroup>, refused to deliver them up, till his Ship was supplied with Slaves; and when his
                            Ship was supplied, which was very soon, from the Number of Prisoners taken, he told the principal
                            Man of New Town that he would not deliver them up, but would carry them off the Coast, 
                            which he did.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <ecda:persGroup a-gender="male" a-status="enslaved">Two Brothers of the King</ecda:persGroup> were sold in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>; but some Means or other they got
                            to <placeName>America</placeName>, (to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> or <placeName>Maryland</placeName>), from thence they got to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, where they were taken
                            up, and put on board-Ship to be sent back to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Jones</persName>, an <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Merchant
                            in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, who had Ships trading to <placeName>Old Calabar</placeName>, got them taken out of the Ship by a 
                            Habeas Corpus, and they were returned in one of the Ships to <placeName>Old Calabar</placeName>, after an Absence of
                            Five or Six Years, while <persName>Captain Hall</persName> was there. The <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="king">King of Old Town</ecda:anonPers> was fortunate enough
                            to make his Escape by killing <ecda:persGroup>Two of the Ship's Crew</ecda:persGroup>, who first endeavoured to seize him. He
                            then got into a little Canoe, called a One Man Canoe; One of the Ships fired a Gun at the Canoe
                            and broke it in two; he then swam on Shore, and got into the Wood opposite the Ship. He
                            was about three Miles off, where he was attended by the <ecda:anonPers a-occupation="surgeon">Surgeon of the London Ships</ecda:anonPers>. This was
                            the Commencement of the War, which lasted three or four Years.

                        <p>The Account given by the <ecda:anonPers a-status="freed" a-gender="male">King's Brothers</ecda:anonPers> of their Treatment in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, was, that they
                            had not been treated well there; but were well used in <placeName>America</placeName>.

                        <p>The Government of the Country from <placeName>Congo</placeName> to <placeName>Angola</placeName> is limited Monarchy. In the Kingdoms
                            of <placeName>Loango</placeName>, <placeName>Melimba</placeName>, and <placeName>Cabenda</placeName>, which are on the Coast, the Inheritance goes in the female
                            Line; that is, the Sons of the Daughters only succeed. A Princess in this Country is invested
                            with a great Power, and may marry whom she pleases. In this she is not influenced by Affection
                            but selects some Freeman who is become rich by his Talents and Industry in Trade, and who is
                            enabled better to administer to her Extravagance, and the more effectually to support her
                            Dignity. She does not even consult this Person until her Messengers announce to him the Princess's
                            Resolution of the Honour she intents of making him her Husband, which is generally received
                            with Reluctance, and sometimes with Horror; for he must for ever quit his Home, his Wives,
                            and Children. The only Consolation he has is, that he becomes a Prince; and to distinguish such
                            Person from a Prince born, he is denominated a Catched Prince; a Guard is appointed him, partly
                            as an Appendage to his new Dignity, and partly as a Watch over his Actions; such Guard
                            being the Creatures of his Wife the Princess, should he be so imprudent as to have any
                            Commerce with his former Wives, or any other Women, Death would be the immediate Consequence,
                            while the Princess is left at large without Controul, and often carries on her Amours without any
                            Regard to Decency; nor dare her Husband complain.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Manner in which these Monarchies are limited is as follows:</p>
                        <p>There is a Council of Princes of the Blood Royal, whom the King is bound to consult on all
                            Occasions, and there are Two great Officers of State who are principally concerned in the 
                            Government of the Country. The one having the Direction of the interior Country, and the other Prince
                            that of the Sea Coast and Trade; the former is called the King's Mongoba, and the other Prince
                            Mambooka. There is another Officer called the Mamfooka, who is the Governor at the Place
                            where the <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> Factories are established, but who is subject to the Controul of the Prince
                            Mambooka beforementioned. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> speaks from his own Knowledge with respect to the Laws of his
                            Country, is not permitted to see the Sea, nor to wear any Manufactures of any Country but his
                            own, nor to have any Thing to do with Trade; but through the Mongoba he receives certain
                            Customs upon the Trade of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>From <placeName>Cape Lopez</placeName> to <placeName>Angola</placeName> the Extent is about 140 Leagues. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> cannot positively
                            say what is the Extent of the Three Kingdoms before mentioned, <emph>inland</emph>, but believes it may be
                            from 200 to 300 miles. He cannot say any Thing positively with respect to the Nature of the
                            Government in any of the interior Countries bordering on the said Three Kingdoms, but understands
                            that they are divided into Petty States, governed by Princes, with the Nature of whose Authority
                            he is not much acquainted.
                        </p>
                        <p ana="#religion">With respect to the religious Institutions of these Kingdoms, the People believe in a good and
                            bad Deity: They have some few Images, but he never understood they worshipped them; he rather
                            believes they are considered as Charms or Amulets. They bury their Princes with great Pomp and
                            Lamentation, consuming a great Variety of their Effects, and the Trinkets of the deceased, but
                            they have not any human Sacrifices; the lower Orders of the People follow this Example as far as 
                            their Circumstances permit. <persName>Mr. Penny</persName> has never observed them to pray, and the Reason they
                            assign for do not doing so is, <said rend="italic">that God knows what is best for them</said>.

                            Mr. Barnes can say nothing; but at Senegal he has known them made Slaves for the 
                            Commission of Crimes. The Crimes they are charged with are Theft and Adultery (very
                            commonly), but principally Witchcraft. They are tried for these Crimes before the King, or the
                            principal Man of the District, assisted by some Elders, who hear the Evidence, and decide on the
                            Fate of the Party accused.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Barnes being asked whether he did not apprehend that Crimes were imputed for the Purpose of 
                            making Slaves? said, No; and added, that as far as he had been acquanted with Africa,
                            he does not know of any Country where consisted with the Laws of the Country) Justice is more
                            fairly administered; it is administered always in the Presence of the Seniors of the District, and
                            with their Approbation and Consent. In the Countries wherewith Mr. Barnes has been particularly
                            acquainted, he never heard of the Kings or the great men breaking up Villages for the Purpose of 
                            making Slaves. He has heard, that when the Payment of the Revenue has been refused,
                            and in Cases of Rebellion, or any Kind of Resistance against the King, he has attacked those
                            Villages and seized the Inhabitants, som of whom have been made Slaves, but they are always
                            allowed to redeem themselves.

                        </note>
                        <p>Mr. Barnes has known some Prisoners of War made Slaves, but not very often; he never
                            heard of any who had been kidnapped by the Black Traders; he has not only resided at Senegal, 
                            but has been at Gambia, and in the Bite of Benin, and never know any Country where 
                            <emph>Kidnapping</emph> was practised, or where the Constitution of the Country would admit of it; it is
                            impossible they should do it without being detected, and they would be punished very severly
                            in consequence: The Punishment in such Cases would never be less than Two Slaves for any
                            single Slave of the basest Quality, and for others, in Proportion to their Quality, as far as Ten
                            or a Dozen. Mr. Barnes believes, that the principal Source of Slavery is Crimes; and when he
                            considers the Extent of Africa, and how populous in all Parts where he has been, he is not
                            surprized that this Source should furnish the great Number of Slaves which it does: The Wars, in
                            those Parts of Africa where he has been, are not destructive Wars, and do not therefore much
                            diminish the Numbers of People. Mr. Barnes never heard that Wars were made for the
                            Purpose of procuring Slaves, nor does he believe that such a War is practicable; for if a Prince
                            was to make War on such a Motive, he would draw all the neighbouring States upon himself.
                            The Wars in Africa spring from the same Causes as those in Europe; and as their Governments
                            are very weak, there are also internal Wars between the Chiefs or great men of the respective
                            Kingdoms.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most of the Slaves exported from Senegal are brought from the interior country; they are
                            bought of the Black Traders, who are either Natives of the Two Kingdoms of Walo, and Cayor or
                            Demel, or of the interior Country, who bring them down from thence to different Parts of the
                            River. The French trade in small Vessels to Fort St. Joseph, whic is near 360 Leagues up the
                            River, and go sometimes as far as the first Cataract, whic is about 20 Leagues further, where 
                            they purchase Slaves, who are supposed to be brought from Places 200 or 300 Leagues higher
                            up the Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>The River Senegal is supposed to take its Rise from the western Declivity of the Mountains of
                            Gowvina, which rise in the Desert, and run North and South. The River Niger takes its Rise
                            from the Eastern Declivity of those Mountains, and discharges itself into a large Lake, the Name
                            of which Mr. Barnes does not recollect: The Africans navigate both these Reviers, and in such
                            Places where there are Cataracts carry their Goods upon Asses. The Slaves which are brought
                            down to Gambia, as well as Senegal, are collected in the Countries bordering on the above Rivers.
                            Mr. Barnes has heard from the Black Traders, that there are White Inhabitants upon the Borders
                            of the Lake before mentioned, who have a Fort mounted with Guns upon the Lake; and has
                            been told, from People who have seen them, that they dress in the Stile of Barbary Moors, and
                            wear Turbans, but do not speak Arabick.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Barnes being asked, if he knew at what age Slaves are purchased? replied, They are
                            seldom purchased under the Age of Fourteen; as the lowest Size required for the West-Indies is
                            Four Feet. They are purchased from Fourteen Years of Age to Thirty-five in general, but
                            sometimes even so old as Fifty. The Question being asked, if they are made Slaves so young as
                            Fourteen for Crimes? he replied, For one Species of Crimes is very often, namely, Witchcraft;
                            because the Punishment for the Crime of Witchcraft involves in it the whole Family. In Senegal
                            and Gambia there are very few Slaves bought at so early an Age as Fourteen; they are generally
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            grown People. The Profit arising from the Slaves sold for Crimes goes in general to the Person
                            injured.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Number of Slaves exported from Senegal is but small, baout 1400 or 1500 annually. Mr.
                            Barnes cannot tell what becomes of those Slaves condemned to be sold for Crimes, who are not
                            purchased by the Europeans.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Barnes being asked, whether our Traders obtained at present Slaves from Port Anderic?
                            replied, No; they trade for nothing there but Gum Senega. Being asked, if any Trade is carried
                            on in European Manufactures up the River Senegal and down the Niger, or in African Produce
                            up the Niger and down the Senegal? said, There is no commercial Communication between
                            the Two Rivers; the Salves who are brought from the interior Country, are brought over the
                            Mountains, or through the Passes of them. It is understood that these interior Countires have a
                            great deal of <emph>commercial Communication</emph> both with Egypt and the States of Barbary. Mr. Barnes
                            speaks to his own Knowledge of a very great Communication between the Banks of the River
                            Senegal and the Kingdom of Morocco. The King of Morocco claims a Sovereignty over this
                            Country as far as the River Senegal, and levies a Tribute upon the different Tribes of Moors
                            inhabiting the same. There is likewise a very great Communication between Morocco and the
                            Inhabitants of the River Senegal, who sell great Numbers of Slaves, whic hare carried into the
                            Kingdom of Morocco. A like Communication is carried on, by means of Caravans, with the 
                            more ilnad Counties in the same Parallel of Latitude, from Tunis and Tripoly; and still farther 
                            to the Eastard, through Nubia, with the Upper Egypt. the Commodities furnished to
                            the Negroes of these Countries consist chiefly in Tobacco, Arms and Ammunition, Horses, some
                            of the Cloths of Barbary, and the East Indies; and the Returns are made, for the greatest Part,
                            in Negro Slaves, and some little Gold.

                        <byline rend="place-inside">Mr. Wadstrom.</byline>
                        <p>Mr. Charles Wadstrom, a Native of Sweden, has been from Sengal almost to Gambia.
                            He went from France in the Month of July 1787, arrived upon the Coast about the last
                            Day of August, and remainde there till the Middle or Endo f Januar. He went out with Two
                            of his Countrymen, with the Intention o penetrating into the interior Part of Africa, and to
                            proceed to the Red Sea; but they were prevented by the Wars between the Negroes and the
                            Moors, and also between the Negroes and the French settled at Senegal; the latter arose on
                            Account of exclusive Privileges granted to the Senegal Company. The Gum Trade was always
                            carried on by an exclusive Company, but the French have now extended the exclusive Privilege to 
                            every sort of Trade carried on at the River Senegal, which has given great Offence to all the 
                            Inhabitants of that Country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Wadstrom was much on Shore, and has been told by the Black and the Mulatto Inhabitants
                            upon the Coast, as well as by the travelling Blacks and Mullatoes, of many of the
                            Slaves exported from that Country, are Prisoners made in War; that these Wars are frequently
                            excited by the Mundingos, a People who live in the interior Part of the Country, and are for
                            the most Part Mahometans. That the Mundingos buy the Slaves and bring them to certain
                            Places, where they are met by the Traders, who bring them down to the Coast. Being asked if
                            he has ever conversed with any of the Mundingos? he said, No; They never came to Goree or
                            Senegal; but he has been told they sometimes come to Sierra Leone and Gambia. Mr.
                            Wadstrom being aksed, whether he knew of any other Means by which Slaves were made? replied,
                            When there is no War, and they cannot therefore obtain Slaves that Way, the King of the Country,
                            who is absolute, seizes upon his own People and exchanges them for European Merchandize.
                            There are however some Families in the Country who are not liable to be seized upon and made
                            Slaves and sold. the Princes of the Country, of whom there are a great Number, are the
                            Persons who sell the Slaves, and who chiefly carry on this Trade. It is necessary always to apply
                            to them upon arriving on the Coast, and all the European Merchandize is sold through their
                            Means. They are also principally concerned in the bringing down the Slaves who come from
                            the interior Country; and whatever other Merchants there may be, they are in fact Dependants
                            of these Princes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Wadstrom excepts from this Description the Subjects of some of the Countries, particularly
                            of the Kingdom of Demel, who carry on a Trade in Slaves themselves, frequently seizing the
                            Blacks who are Subjects of other Kingdoms, and are travelling through the Country, or who
                            live on the Fronteirs of the neighbouring States, and sending them away immediately on board
                            such Ships as lie at hand; but this may be considered as a Sort of contraband Trade, and is
                            against the Laws of the Contry. The greates Number of the Slaves sold in the Time of Peace
                            are Children and Women, these being more easily seized on, as not being able to defend
                            themselves. There are some Slaves sold in consequence of their Crimes, but Mr. Wadstrom is
                            sure thes make the smallest Part. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Wadstrom being asked, What was the Number of Slaves which, to his Knowledge, were
                            sold in thos Part of the Coast during the Time he was there, and the Proportion of Men, Women,
                            and Children? said, he could not speak with Certainty, without Recourse to his Papers; but to
                            take the Number rather below than above, he estimated them at from 600 to 700. That more than
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            half of this Number were Women and Children, and of them the greater Part Children, and some
                            of them very young. Of thse 600 or 700, the greater Number whilst he was there were Natives
                            of the Coast, for at that Time there were no considerable Wars in the interior Country. The
                            Trade in Slaves upon the Coast he speaks of, is carried on by the French only.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Wadstrom being asked, Whether there were not Traders who go into the interior Country
                            for the purpose of buying Slaves, independent of any Wars existing there? said, that when he
                            was on the Coast, it was not the Season when the Slaves are brought down from the interior Country;
                            during the Harvest Time of the Country it generally at Peace; when the Harvest is over they 
                            frequently make War upon each other. Being aksed, Whether of the Numbers he had seen, who
                            were made Slaves, they in general expressed any Concern at the Loss of their Liberty? He said,
                            There were some who did not, but the greater Number do, particularly the Women; it could not
                            be expected that the Children should.
                        </p>
                        <p>At a subsequent Period Mr. Wadstrom transmitted to the Committee, by Letter, an Extract
                            from the Journal he kept while he was on the Coast of Africa, in 1787, relative to some English
                            Vessels, employed in the Slave Trade having been cut off in the River Gambia.—Which Extract is as follows:

                                <p>Captain Wignie, a French Captain, from Rochelle, who arrived here a few Days ago from
                                    Albreda, a French Factory in the River Gambia, where he had spent some Months in trading
                                    for Slaves, communicated to me a melancholy Circumstance that happened during his Stay there.
                                    He informed me that Three English Vessels had lately cut off at the Mouth of that River by
                                    the Natives along the Shore.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Reason of such a dreadful Catastrophe was this: it is usual when a Vessel is slaved, and
                                    ready to sail, for Free Negroes to come on board to be treated with Punch and other Things, and
                                    to take their Leave. This was the Case on Board one of the Vessels alluded to, when a favourable
                                    Wind suddenly springing up, the Captain sailed away with those who had come on board in this Manner.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Wind however suddenly changing again, he was driven back to the same Part of the 
                                    Coast from whence he had taken them. The Natives on the Shore, being apprized of his
                                    Return, seized the Vessel, and not only his, but (as Captain Wignie was informed) Two
                                    others of the same Nation. ONly a few out of all their Crews were fortunate to escape, and
                                    these took Refuge at the French Factory at Albreda, where Captain Wignie's Vessel lay. Whether
                                    the Captains were all of them killed or not, Captain Wignie does not immediately recollect.
                                </p>
                                <p>Captain Wignie assured me also, that the taking away of Free Negroes frequently happens,
                                    particularly among the English and Dutch. Captain Le Loup also gave me the same Sort of 
                                    Information upon the Coast.

                        <p>Mr. Wadstrom, having again attended the Committee, confirmed the Account given in the
                            above Extract; and added, that, since his Return to England, he had heard from some of the
                            Underwriters the Circumstance of the Two English Ships having been cut off in the River Gambia in
                            1787, and he had no Doubt they were the same Ships which he had heard mentioned when he
                            was on the Coast.

                        <p>Dr. Andrew Spaarman, a Native of Sweden, Professor of Physic and Inspector of the
                            Museum of the Royal Academy at Stockholm, was in Africa, at the Cape of Good Hope, Fourteen
                            Years ago, and from thence made a Journey into the interior Parts of Africa. From that
                            part of the Coast no Export Trade in Slaves is carried on; but the Dutch Colonists settled in
                            Farms in the interior Part of the Country, to th Distance of 900 Miles, frequently seize on the
                            Hottentot Inhabitants, and force them to Work for them. A Vessel is sent generally every Three
                            Years to purchase Slaves for the Use of this Colony, from Madagascar; they do not chuse to send
                            to Mozambique, as it is so near, being afraid they would escape and get back. Cape Twon is 
                            likewise supplied with Slaves by the Dutch and French East India Ships from Borneo, Banda, Batavia,
                            and Sumatra; the laborious Work at Cape Twon is entirely done by Slaves; he does not
                            exactly know the Number of Slaves at Cape Town, but the Proportion of Slaves to Whites is
                            Ten to One.

                            the Government or Religion of the Country.
                        </note>
                        <p>Dr. Spaarman has lately been at Senegal, Goree, and Shual. He sailed from France in the
                            Month of July 1787, arrived on the Coast about the end of August, and remained there till the
                            Middle or End of Januar. The Object of his Voyage was partly Health and partly Curiosity,
                            particularly with a View to Natural History; his Design was to penetrate into the interior Parts of
                            Africa, but met with so many Obstacles, that he was obliged to give up that Part of his Project.
                            Being aksed in what manner the Slaves exported from this part of the Coast are procured, and
                            how they are made Slaves? Dr. Spaarman gave the following Account:
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Kings of the Country watn Slaves for the Purchase of Goods, they send their Horsemen
                            in the Night to the Villages to make as many Slaves as they can. In the Neighbourhood of
                            
                            <pb/>
                            
                            Goree, he saw one of these Expeditions. The King of Barbessin came to him in the Night to tell
                            him that he was going to send out a Party to make Slaves, as he wanted Brandy to encourage his
                            Officers. In the Course of the Conversation, the King became so intoxicated with Madeira by
                            Dr. Spaarman's Bed Side, that he was carried away speechless. Dr. Spaarman saw the Party set
                            out, and saw them return with some Slaves they had made. They conceal Part of those they make
                            on these Occasions, in order to enhance their Price.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Way of making Slaves is by Wars, which are frequently entered into for that Purpose.
                            When he was at Senegal, the Moors were very much encouraged by the French Traders to
                            make War on the Negroes, as Slaves were wanted for the Makret; they did so, and Dr. Spaarman
                            saw several brought in more or less wounded; among whom were many Women and Children,
                            and the Women were in great Affliction.
                        </p>
                        <p>A Third way is by private kidnapping; they seize one another in the Night when they have
                            Opportunity, and sometimes they invite each other to thier Houses, and there detain and sell them
                            to the European Traders. The Number of Persons so kidnaped is considerable, and of this Pracice
                            he has seen two instances himself. and it appeared to him to be a common Practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Way is by Accusations by the King, or by each other (frequently false) for various
                            Crimes; in consequence of which the Person accused is sold. If a Person in a Village offends
                            against the King, it serves him as a Pretence for seizing the whole Village and selling them. When a
                            Merchant has Goods to sell, and the Person who wishes to buy them cannot pay immediately, it is
                            usual to give some Person, perhaps a Relation, as an Hostage or Security for the Payment, and 
                            this Person when not redeemed is sold. These are all the Modes Dr. Spaarman knows of in which
                            Slaves are made.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Spaarman being asked, whether the prince of the Country is the Person who sells the
                            Slaves, or Individuals? replied, Both; the Person who has or makes the Slave sells him. The
                            Princes however sell the greatest Number. Dr. Spaarman does not exactly know how many
                            Slaves were sold from this Part of the Coast whilst he was there, but was credibly informed that
                            not more than 600 Slaves were annually exported from the Coast between Goree and Gambia;
                            and that at Senegal about 2,000 are sold. He cannot speak with Accuracy as the the Proportion of
                            Men, Women, and Children; the Number of WOmen and Children was about equal. The Slaves he
                            saw expressed the greatest Concern and Apprehension at the Loss of their Liberty. Many of those
                            he visited in his physical Capacity, on his feeling their Pulse and examining them, trembled with
                            Fear, thinking he was a Purchaser, and would send them to the Islands, which they dread.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Spaarman being asked if the Inhabitants of these Countries appeared to him to be happy?
                            replied, Very much so, if Idleness, Ease, Plenty of Food, and few Wants, constitute Happiness,
                        </p>

                        <byline rend="place-inside">Mr. Dalrymple.</byline>
                        <p>Mr. Dalrymple has always understood one of the Modes of making Slaves to be from the
                            Kings and great Men breaking up a Village; that is, setting Fire to it, sometimes in their own
                            Country, sometimes in the Country of others (but oftener in their own), and seizing the People
                            as they excape from the Fire. He never was present himself when this was done, as it is generally 
                            done in the Night, but has been very near the Spot, and heard that it had been done. He saw
                            many Slaves who told him they had been taken in that manner. The Practice is notorious; it is
                            sometimes done from Resentment, but more often for the Purpose of getting Slaves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being aksed in what other Manner Slaves are procured? replied, Every Person who commits
                            any Sort of Crime is sold for a Slave. Crimes that used formerly to be punished in different
                            Ways are now punished in this. They rarely punish with Death. He remebers a man who
                            had committed Murder, and made his Escape to Goree to avoid being sold for a Slave, and
                            recollects that this Man returned to the Contintent when the Ships were gone. Formerly the 
                            Punishment for all crimes was commuted for a certain Number of Cattle or Quantity of Grain, which
                            was either paid by the Offender or by his Family, in case of his Incapacity. Murder was generally
                            punished with Death; but since the Introduction of the Slave Trade, not only all Crimes are
                            punished by Slavery, but even the most trivial Offences are punished in the same Manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Mode by which the People of the Coutry are sometimes made Slaves is by the wandering
                            Tribes of Moors who inhabit the North Side of the Niger, and cross to the Guinea, and
                            make what Slaves they can, whom they sell to the Europenas. These generally consist of Women
                            and Children, whom they steal out of the Villages while the Men are at Work in the Fields.
                        </p>
                        <p>Domestic Slavery is common in this Country, but these Slaves are treated with great Mildness:
                            Some of these are born Slaves, and some become Slaves to the King, from bot being able to pay
                            their Fine to the King. These become a Sort of Troops, and are employed, among other Things,
                            in breaking up Villages. None of those who are taken by breaking up Villages ever remain in the 
                            Country; they are all sold to Foreign Traders.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pb/>
                        
                        <p>Being asked if the King ever sells any of those Slaves who belong peculiarly to him? Mr. Dalrymple
                            said, he believed he sometimes does, but very seldom. It is a Disgrace to the Family to
                            which the Slave belongs that he should be sold out of the Country. It sometimes happens that
                            People of the first Consequence become Slaves to the King.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Dalrymple having described the Natives as a humane and gentle People, of soft and inoffensive
                            Manners, was asked how he reconciled their Gentleness of Manners with the Conduct of 
                            their Kings and great Men who sell their People for Slaves? and replied, He believed they were
                            guilty of these Barbarities only to procure Brandy, of which the whole Nation is passionately fond.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked if the People were much given to War? said, He believes they hardly ever go to
                            War but in Revenge for some Depredation committed, or in order to make Slaves; and these
                            Wars seldom last longer than Two or Three Days. The Prisoners made in War who are not sold,
                            are redeemed by Cattle, and sometimes exchanged; a Freeman is redeemed by Two Slaves. It is
                            by no Means true that the Prisoners taken in War are put to Death, if not sold to the Europeans.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Number of Slaves sold out of the District he ws in is not a great many, Mr. Dalrymple
                            imagines between 400 and 500 in a Year, but cannot speak positively. The Slaves our Traders
                            purchase are paid for by Exchange of Cotton Stuffs, Fire Arms, Gunpowder, and chiefly Brandy:
                            They are purchased on the King and of the great Men, and sometimes of Individuals: They sell
                            each other as they can. Mr. Dalrymple heard from a Captain of a Ship of One Brother who had
                            sold another, and was himself afterwards sentenced by the Alcaide to be sold, as a Punishment for
                            having sold his Brother. The Alcaide and the chief Men of the Village shared the Profits among
                            themselves. The Two Brothers were puto n Board the same Ship, as he was told, and are now
                            Slaves upon the same Plantation in Tobago. Mr Dalrymple believes this to be a common
                            Practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Kings, or chief Men, bring Slaves to Market, and cannot sell them, they are kept for
                            another Opportunity; but if they are so old as not to be saleable, Mr. Dalrymple has heard they
                            are sometimes put to Death.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Question being akse,d of the different Nations of Europe, what is the Proportion in which
                            each Nation buys Slaves on the Coast? Mr. Dalrymple said, The English and the French chiefly
                            carry on the Trade here, but he did not know in what Proportion.
                        </p>

                        <p>In general a Fourth Part of the Slaves are Delinquents, who have committed Offences against the
                            Customs of the Country, or their respective masters, and are thought improper to remain in the
                            Villages. These are ordered to be sold openly, and without any Form of Trial. Their Delinquencies
                            are for the most Part Disobedience to their Masters, Negligence, Drunkenness, and Intrigues
                            with Women. The Crime of Witchcraft is unknown in these Countries.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Poplett believes, that Two Fourths more are Slaves born and bred in the Country as
                            Stock; the other Fourth Part he believes to be Prisoners made in the Wars, which are stirred up
                            by the Europeans by Means of Liquor; on which Occasions the Europeans Traders go on Shore and
                            purchase the Prisoners on both Sides. Being asked whether the Kings of these Countries permit
                            these Pracitces? he replied, the Kings of these Countries do not prevent it, because they
                            receive Customs from the Slaves so made.
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides the above, there is a Number equal to One Eighth Part of those before spoken of who
                            are brought from the interior Country, particularly from the Country of the Sierrieurs, whom the
                            Moors steal and take away by Force.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Kingdoms of Demel, Tin, Barbessin, and Barra, there are great Numbers of native Slaves
                            whic hare bred for the Purpose of Sale. Mr. Poplett being asked if they had a right to sell them
                            as they please, either among themselves, or to Foreigners? replied, They sell them commonly,
                            and the Slaves had rather be sold to any body than the Moors, who treat them with extreme
                            Cruelty. With respect to their Treatment by their Masters in their own Coutry, they have less
                            Comfort, with full as severy Treatment, as every he saw exercised in the West Indies. The 
                            Masters are uncontrolled in the Punishment of them; they have Power of Life and Death over
                            them, which they frequently exercise.
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr Poplett said, it was impossible for him to ascertain the Number of Slaves exported: They
                            are purchased principally by the French, some by the English, the Danes, and the Ostenders.
                            They are purchased of the King, the Alcaide, and of their respective Masters. There are no
                            Black Traders on this Part of the Coast.
                        </p>
                        <p>Being asked whether the Slaves shew Reluctance or Pleasure at being purchased by the Europeans?
                            Mr. Poplett replied, Great Reluctance; for the Masters or Priests hold out as a general
                            Doctrine to their Slaves, that the Europeans will kill and eat them, if they behave so ill as they
                            do to their respective masters, by which Means the Slaves are kept in better Order, and in great
                            Fear of being sold to the Europeans. This Doctrine is generally believed in that Part of Africa,
                            and has a very political Effect on the Minds of these People.

                    <p>The Committee, before they proceed to submit to <rs type="person">your Majesty</rs>
                        the Information they have collected respecting the Treatment of
                        Slaves in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, think it proper to take Notice, that the
                        Gentlemen who act as Agents for the several Islands, desired that in
                        giving their Evidence they might be considered, not as acting in their 
                        Character of Agents, but as Individuals; and that they were assisted in
                        some Cases, particularly with respect to the Islands of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> and 
                        <placeName>Antigua</placeName>, by Gentlemen who had been long resident in those Islands 
                        respectively, and who attended the Committee with the Agents for the
                        same.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Agents desired leave that they might transmit to their Constituents

                        obtaining the most complete and authentic Intelligence thereupon. And

                                And besides this, the Negroes have in all the Plantations an unbounded Liberty to
                                cultivate as much Land as they please. But as the major Part of them are improvident and
                                negligent, there are few, if any, Estates, the Owners or Managers of which do not keep a

                                for the most part found equal to support and sustain the Slaves to whom they are respecively
                                allotted; and, excepting the Time of Crop, they are allowed, in general, One Day in every
                                Fortnight (independent of Sundays) for the Purpose of cultivating them. In addition to this,
                                they are, in general, served weekly, or once a Fortnight, with <ecda:food>Herrings</ecda:food>, or other Salt Fish,
                                after the Rate of a Herring or other such Fish per Day: They are also allowed Slat as they
                                have occasion to ask for it. Where Lands cannot be allowed them, or where they are inadequate, 
                                or when they seasones happen to fail, the Master furnishes his Slaves, in general, with
                                <ecda:food>Corn</ecda:food>, at the Rate of about Six Quarts per Week, or an adequate Supply in <ecda:food>Flour</ecda:food>, besides

                            <p>The general Clothing in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is what is called Osnaburgh Linen. On every well-
                                regulated Estate, the annual Allowance is from Ten to Twenty Yards to every Man; from
                                Seven to fifteen Yards to every Woman; and in proportion to the younger People. To
                                every Negro, a Worsted Cap, Bonnet, or Hat, besides a Woollen Jacket, or Welch Blanket,
                                to the Men; a Petticoat and Blanket to the Women. The Petticoat is on many Estates
                                of Perptuana; a Quantity of common Check Linen is given on some Estates to the
                                principal Negroes, such as Boilers, Drivers, Waggoners, and Tradesmen; and several of our
                                Planters furnish Handkerchiefs, Knives, Scissars, Thread, Needles, and short Tobacco Pipes.
                                The Jamaica Law enjoins sufficient Clothing to be given, and inflicts a Penalty on such
                                Owners as disobey that Injunction. In general, the Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> are well clothed; and
                                there are very few Sugar Estates where the Negroes do not, from their own private Earnings,
                                provide themselves with extra Clothes for Sundays and Holidays.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Negro Slaves on the Plantations in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, in general (except the calamitous Years),
                                raise more Provisions than they can consume. They carry the Overplus to Market,
                                and commonly lay out the Money they receive for it in Fineries, or in <ecda:commodity>Salt Beef</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity>Pork</ecda:commodity> or
                                <ecda:commodity>Fish</ecda:commodity>, and sometimes in <ecda:commodity>Spiritous Liquors</ecda:commodity>. Before a Planter makes a Purchase of imported
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                Slaves, he prepares Houses for them, allots a Portion of Ground stocked with Provisions;
                                and most Planters also give them a Breed of Hogs and Poultry.
                            </p>
                            <p>The established Negro Slaves lie in Houses perfectly convenient to themselves, and
                                adapted to the Climate; the Size is proportioned to their Rank and Family. When they 
                                require to be rebuilt or enlarged, sufficient Time, Materials, and Assistance are allowed
                                them for those Purposes. Upon the whole, we believe them to be far better clothed, lodged,
                                and fed in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, than the Peasantry of <placeName>Europe</placeName> in general.
                            </p>
                            <p rend="italic">Are there many Instances in which the masters or Overseers treat the Slaves, either with respect
                                to their Food or Clothing, not in conformity to what you have above stated, or otherwise hardly?

                            <p rend="italic">As far as our Knowledge goes, there are few Instances (if any).</p>
                            <p>The Law upon this Head fully appears in the Consolidated Slave Act. With Respect to 
                                the Practice: Slaves employed in Husbandry are usually allowed annually Tow Osnaburgh
                                Frocks, and Two Pair of Osnaburgh Trowsers, with an Hat or Woollen Bonnet to each Man;
                                and to each Woman, Two Shifts and Two Petticoats of Osnaburgh, and a Hat; and to each,
                                whether Man or Woman, a Piece of Woollen Cloth or Blanketing. Drivers, or principal
                                Negroes, are usually allowed a double Proportion of each, with a Check Shirt to the Men of
                                that Description. Domestics and Workmen in and about Towns are clothed as Domestics
                                and Workmen are clothed as in England in the Summer Time.
                            </p>
                            <p>Slaves employed in Husbandry are lodged on the Master's Land, in separate Houses,
                                from about Twenty to Twenty-four Feet in Length, and from Ten to Twelve, or Fourteen
                                broad, and which, if they are themselves unable to erect, their Masters build for them.
                                These Houses are in general thatched, wattled, and plaistered, are found a very sufficient 
                                Protection against the most inclement Seasons, and are for the most Part full as commodious as the
                                Cottages of the labouring Peasantry in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>. Domestics are as well lodged as Domestics
                                in <placeName>England</placeName>.

                            <p>What is the Annual Expence of the Maintenance of a Negro Man, Woman, and Child,
                                at different Ages respectively?
                            </p>
                            <p>This Question is not properly applicable to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; for in this Island, as the Negroes in all
                                the Country Parts have Lands assigned them, and are not restricted in Extent of Ground, the
                                Produce of which, together with an Allowance of Herring or other Salt Fish, Sugar and Rum,
                                form the principal Source of their Subsistence; we do not know of any Computation which
                                has been, or can be well made of the Annual Expence.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Answer to this will be collected from the answer already given to the 5th Query,
                                which represents the Allowance as applied to Men and Women; a Deduction according to the
                                Ages of Boys and Girls is usually made.

                            <p>Are many Negroes usually let out to hire, in what Numbers and on what Conditions?</p>
                            <p>Till within these Twelve or Fourteen Years, a few Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> were let out to hire,
                                except Domestics and Tradesmen.—But in consequence of some Discouragements which the 
                                Article <ecda:commodity>Coffee</ecda:commodity> met with, most of the Coffee Planters began to let out their working Negroes
                                upon Job Work, on the Sugar Estates.
                            </p>
                            <p>This Business has ever since been followed pretty extensively in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, both by the inferior
                                Settlers, and such Overseers of Sugar-works, who have from time to time become Owners of
                                Negroes, but not yet possessed of Land of their own, or who have not applied themselves to the
                                Culture of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Planters have many of them adopted this Practice, both on account of the very advanced
                                Proce of imported Negroes, and from the Principle of easing and assisting their own People
                                in the several Parts of their Annual Labour.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Expence of Job Labour is in general, for holeing and planting Canes, per Acre, 6 l.
                                to 7 l. Currency.
                            </p>
                            <p>Other Operations have their respective usual Prices, as planting Guinea Grass, 5 l. per Acre,
                                Currency, &amp;c.
                            </p>
                            <p>We do not know that it is usual in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, with any Planters in tolerable Circumstances, to
                                hire Negroes for any other Operation in the annual Cane Culture and Manufacture, except 
                                holeing and planting, and sometimes taking off the Crop.
                            </p>
                            <p>Slaves are frequently hired out; those employed by Day Work in Husbandry, usually at
                                1 s. 10½ d. per Day; those by the Year at 12 l. or 15 l. per Annum, or at a Rate per Cent. on 
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                their Value; this is usually from 8 l. to 10 l. per Cent. the Hirer being responsible for any Loss.
                                In the two latter Instances, the Slaves so hired usually remain on the Land where they are
                                hired to work, and are clothed, lodged, and supported in like Manner as the other Slaves
                                on the Plantation.

                                afflicted with it, die notwithstanding the ablest medical Assistance.—As to other Distempers,
                                it is not pretended that Negroe Slaves are naturally more subject to them than the White
                                Inhabitants or Free Negroes; what Difference is observable between them in this Respect, is 
                                chiefly to be attributed to <emph>Manners</emph>.—Numbers of the Negroe Slaves in that Island either
                                perish or are rendered Invalits by Fevers, Fluxes, and Pleurisies, occasioned by their Habit of
                                rambling to what are called <distinct rend="italic">Negro Plays</distinct> or nocturnal Assemblies, in distant Parts, where
                                they dance immoderately, drink to Excess, sleep on the damp Ground in open Air, and
                                commit such Acts of Sensuality and Intemperance, as bring on the most fatal Distempers.
                                No Causes, perhaps, more impede the natural Increase of the Slaves than these; the Women
                                catch Cold; their natural Periods are obstructed; they have Commerce too early in Life, even
                                at the Age of Nine, and with a Multitude of Men; and both Sexes studiously conceal
                                Infection with the venereal Taint, unil it becomes almost irremediable. The Negroes, both
                                Men and Women, most studiously endeavour to conceil their Infection with this Disorder,
                                either considering it as reproachful to them, or the Necessity of abstaining from Pleasure 
                                during the medicinal Course as an intolerable Punishment.

                            <p>Of the Disorders which are more peculairly fatal to them, may be mentioned the Small
                                Pox and epidemic Dysentery. From the former, scarcely any who are seized with it in the
                                natural Way, escape with Life; the latter Distemper commonly happens during a long
                                Drought, when their usual Stock of vegetable Provisions failing, or the Plantain Trees
                                destroyed, they feed on unaccustomed Substances, such as <ecda:food>Flour</ecda:food> (half dressed) and <ecda:food>Rice</ecda:food>, and

                            <p>The Duration fo their Lives (meaning the Native Blacks) is in general equal to that of the
                                Free Negroes, and longer than that of the Whites. But, in considering this Question, due Regard
                                must be had to local Differences of Situation. The lowest Situations, such as Vallies,
                                and the Banks of Rivers and Lagoons, are the most unhealthy; and in such Situations in
                                general, the Negroes will every be found the most distempered, sickly, and short-lived. The
                                Native Slaves, if industrious and sober, in general attain to the more common Periods of human
                                Life: The Women in general outlive the Men. As great Part of the Sugar Estates are
                                Lowlands, the Whites as well as the Blacks are subject to the same Inconveniencies in point of
                                Health, if they live at their Works. There is no Doubt but the Negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, whether

                            <p>Many Negroes live to be old, some to the Age of One Hundred Years; the Period of
                                their Lives is, in general, of longer Duration that that of the Lives of the White Inhabitants
                                in this Climate. The Free Negroes (who, by the Labour of One or Two Days, may year na

                                by positive Institutions; no such Practice exists among the Slaves, and they are left entirely
                                free in this respect. But every prudent Planter encourages his Negroes to form their Connexions
                                upon his own Estate, as a Means of preventing them from rambling every Night to
                                Other Estates in the Neighbourhood, and of reducing them to a temperate and orderly Habit of
                                Life. The pregnant Woman has easy Work assigned her; at the Time of Parturition she is
                                attended by a Midwife, and for a Month by a careful Nurse, and. if the Case should require it,
                                by medical Assistance: She has also every Indulgence in Food proper for lying-in Women.
                                Few of these Women die of child-bed Fevers, but Miltitudes of Infants are carried off by
                                the Tetanus, or locked Jaw. The suckling Women are put to some gentle Work at a proper
                                Distance of Time after their Deliver. Their Infants are laid under Shelter, here they
                                are taken care of by One or more Dry-nurses, and the Mother comes frequently to give them
                                the Breast. Such as are Nurses have an extra Allowance out of the Stores. When the Children
                                are able to run about, they are usually brought up every Day at Noon to the Overseer's
                                House, to be served with Messes of Broth provided for them; and many are brought up in
                                Families, during Infancy, in the same Manner as White Children.

                            <p>The Law of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is—<quote rend="quotes">That all Masters or Mistresses, or, in their Absence, Overseers,

                                where it is so universally practiced, tha we believe there are few of the larger Estates possessing
                                those who usually attract the greatest Devotion and Confidence, those whose hoary Heads,
                                and a somewhat peculiarly harsh and diaboloic in their Aspect, together with some Skill in
                                Plants of the medicinal and poisonous Species, have qualified them for successful imposition
                                upon the weak and credulous. The Negroes in general, whether <placeName>Africans</placeName> or <placeName>Creoles</placeName>, revere,
                                consult, and abhor them; to these Oracles they resort, and with the most implicit Faith, upon

                                Insults, the Conciliating of Favour, the Discovery and Punishment of the Thief or the
                                Adulterer, and the Prediction of future Events. The Trade with these Wretches carry on
                                at different Prices. A Veil of Mystery is studiously thrown over their Incantations, to
                                which the Midnight Hours are allotted, and every Precuation is taken to conceal them from
                                the Knowledge and Discovery of the White People. The deluded Negroes, who thoroughly
                                believe in their supernatural Power, become the willing Accomplices in this Concealment,
                                and the stoutest among them tremble at the very Sight of the ragged Bundle, the Bottle or
                                the Egg-shells, which are stuck in the Thatch or hung over the Door of a Hut, or upon the
                                Branch of a Plantain Tree, to deter Marauders. In Cases of Poison, the natural Effects of
                                it are by the ignorant Negroes ascribed entirely to the potent workings of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>. The
                                wiser Negroes hesitate to reveal their Suspicions, through a Dread of incurring the terrible
                                Vengeance which is fulminated by the <name rend="italic">Obiah-men</name> against any who should betray them; it is
                                very difficult therefore for the White Proprietor to distinguish the <distinct rend="italic">Obia Possessor</distinct> from any
                                other Negro upon his Plantation; and so infatuated are the Blacks in general, that but few
                                Instances occur of their having assumed Courage enough to impeach these Miscreants. With
                                Minds so firmly prepossessed, they no sooner find <name rend="italic">Obi</name> <emph>set for them</emph> near the Door of their
                                House, or in the Path which leads to it, than they give themselves up for lost. When a
                                Negro is robbed of a Fowl or a Hog, he applies directly to the <rs type="properAdjective">Obiah</rs>-Man or Woman; it
                                is then made known among his Fellow Blacks, that <distinct rend="italic"><name>Obi</name> is set</distinct> for the Thief; and as soon as
                                the latter hears the dreadful News, his terrified Imagination begins to work, no Resource is
                                left but in the superior Skill of some more eminent <name rend="italic">Obiah-Man</name> of the Neighbourhood,
                                who may counteract the magical Operations of the other; but if no one can be found
                                of higher Rank and Ability, or if after gaining such an Ally he should still fancy himself
                                affected, he presently falls into a Decline, under the incessant Horrour of impending Calamities.
                                The slightest painful Sensation in the Head, the Bowels, or any other Part, any
                                casual Loss or Hurt, confirms his apprehensions, and he belives himself the devoted 
                                Victim of an invisible and irresistible Agency. Sleep, Appetite, and Cheerfulness, forsake
                                him, his Strength decays, his disturbed Imagination is haunted without Respite, his Features
                                wear the settled Gloom of Despondency; Dirt, or any other unwholesome Substance, becomes
                                his only Food, he contracts morbid Habit of the Body, and gradually sinks into the Grave.
                                A Negro, who is taken ill, enquires of the <name rend="italic">Obiah-man</name> the Cause of his Sickness, whether
                                it will prove mortal or not, and within what Time he shall die or recover? The Oracle
                                generally ascribes the Distemper to the Malice of some particular Person by Name, and
                                advises to set <name rend="italic">Obi</name> for that Person; but if no Hopes are given of Recovery, immediate
                                Despair takes place, which no Medicine can remove, and Death is the certain Consequence.
                                Those anomalous Symptoms, which originate from Causes deeply rooted in the Mind, such
                                as the Terrours of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>, or from Poisons, whose Operation is slow and intricate, will baffle
                                the Skill of the ablest Physician.
                            </p>
                            <p>Considering the Multitude of Occasions which may provoke the Negroes to exercise the
                                Power of <name rend="italic">Obi</name> against each other, and the astonishing Influence of this Superstition upon their
                                Minds, we cannot but attribute a very considerable Portion of the annual Mortality among
                                the Negroes of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> to this fascinating Mischief.

                            <p>The <name rend="italic">Obi</name> is usually composed of a Farrago of Materials, most of which are enumerated in
                                the Jamaica Law <seg xml:id="a03ish" corresp="#n03ish">(a)</seg>, viz. <quote rend="quotes">Blood, Feathers, Parrots Beaks, Dogs Teeth, Alligators

                            <p>With a view to illustrate the Description we have given of this Practice and its common
                                Effects, we have subjoined a few Examples out of the very great Number which have occurred
                                in Jamaica; not that they are peculiar to that Island only, for we believe similar Examples
                                may be found in other West India Colonies. <persName rend="italic">Pere Labat</persName>, in his <title>History of <placeName>Martinico</placeName></title>, has
                                mentioned some which are very remakrable <seg xml:id="a04ish" corresp="#n04ish">(b)</seg>.
                            </p>
                            <p>It may seem extraordinary, that a Practice alleged to be so freqent in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> should not
                                have received an early Check from the Legislature. The Truth is, that the Skill of some
                                Negroes in the Art of Poisoning has been noticed ever since the Colonists became much
                                acquainted with them. <persName>Sloane</persName> and <persName>Barham</persName>, who practised Physic in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the last Century, 
                                have mentioned particular instances of it. The secret and insidious Manner in which
                                this Crime is generally perpetuated, makes the legal Proof of it extremely difficult. Suspicions
                                therefore have been frequent, but Detections rare: These Murderers have <emph>sometimes</emph>
                                been brought to Justice, but it is reasonable to believe that a far greater Number have
                                escaped with Impunity. In regard to the other and more common Tricks of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>, such as
                                hanging up Feathers, Bottles Eggshells, &amp;c. &amp;c. in order to intimidate Negroes of a theivish
                                Disposition from plundering Huts, Hog-styes, or Provision Grounds, these were laughted at by
                                the White Inhabitants as harmless Stratagems, contrived by the more sagacious for deterring
                                the more simple and superstitious Blacks, and serving for much the same Purpose as the
                                Scarecrows, which are in general used among our <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> Farmers and Gardeners. But in the
                                Year 1760, when a very formidible Insurrection of the Cormantin or Gold Coast Negroes
                                broke out in the <placeName>Parish of St. Mary</placeName>, and spread through almost every other District of the 
                                Parish, who had administered the Fetish or solemn Oath to the Conspirators, and furnished 
                                them with a magical Preparation which was to render them invulnerable, was fortunately 
                                apprehended, convicted, and hung up with all his Feathers and Trumperies about him and
                                this Execution struck the Insurgents with a general Panic, from which they never afterwards
                                recovered. The Examinations which were taken at that period first opened the Eyes of
                                this Law, the strict Investigation which ever since been made after the Professors of <name rend="italic">Obi</name>,
                                nor the many Examples of those who from Time to Time have been hanged or transported,
                                like others in the World, has flourished under Persecution; or that fresh Supplies are annually
                                introduced from the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> Seminaries.

                                    <p>Upon returning to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the Year <date when="1775">1775</date>, he found a great many of his Negroes had died
                                        during his Absence; and that of such as remained alive, at least One-half were debilitated,
                                        bloated, and in a very deplorable Condition. The Mortality continued after his Arrival, and
                                        Two or Three were frequently buried in One Day; others were taken ill, and began to decline
                                        under the same Symptoms. Every Means were tried by Medicines, and the most
                                        careful Nursing, to preseve the Lives of the feebles; but in spite of all his Endeavours,
                                        this Depopulation went on for above a Twelvemonth longer, with more or less Intermission,
                                        and without his being able to ascertain the real Cause, though the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct> was strongly
                                        suspected, as well by himself, as by the Doctor and other White Persons upon the Plantation,
                                        as it was known to have been very common in that Part of the Island, and particularly among the
                                        Negroes of the <placeName rend="italic">Pawpaw</placeName> of <placeName rend="italic">Popo</placeName> Country. Still he was unable to verify his Suspicions, because
                                        the Patients constantly denied their having any Thing to do with Persons of that Order, or
                                        any Knowledge of them. At length <ecda:anonPers a-gender="female" a-arc="negress" a-status="enslaved">a Negress</ecda:anonPers>, who had been ill for some Time, came one
                                        Day and informed him, that feeling it was impossible for her to live much longer, she thought
                                        herself bound in Duty, before she died, to impart a very great Secret, and acquaint him
                                        with the true Cause of her Disorder, in hopes that the Disclosure might prove the Means
                                        of stopping that Mischief which had already swept away a Number of her Fellow-slaves.
                                        She proceeded to say, that <ecda:anonPers a-status="enslaved" a-gender="female" a-religion="obi">her Step-mother</ecda:anonPers> (a Woman of the <placeName rend="italic">Popo <hi rend="upright">Country</hi></placeName>, above Eighty

                                        who had lately died; and that the old Woman had practised <name rend="italic">Obi</name> for as many Years past
                                        as she could remember.

                                    <p>The other Negroes of the Plantation no sooner heard of this Impeachment, than they ran
                                        in a Body to their Master, and confirmed the Truth of it, adding, that she had carried on
                                        this Business ever since her Arrival from <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and was the Terror of the whole Neighbourhood.—
                                        Upon this he repaired directly with Six White Servants to the old Woman's House,
                                        and forcing open the Door, observed the whole inside of the Roof (which was Thatch),
                                        and every Crevice of the Walls, stuck with the Implements of her trade, consisting of Rags,
                                        Feathers, Bones of Cats, and a thousand other Articles. Examining further, a large earthen
                                        Pot or Jar, close covered, was found concealed under the Bed.—It contained a prodigious
                                        quantity of round Balls of Earth or Clay of various Dimensions, large and small, whitened
                                        on the Outside, and variously compounded, some with Hair and Rags or Feathers of all Sorts,
                                        and strongly bound with Twine; others Blended with the upper Section of the Skulls of Cats,
                                        or stuck round with Cats Teeth and Claws, or with Human or Dogs Teeth, and some Glass
                                        Beads of different Colours; there were also a great many Eggshells filled with a viscous or
                                        gummy Substance, the Qualities of which he neglected to examine, and many little Bags
                                        stuffed with a variety of Articles, the Particulars of which cannot at this Distance of Time
                                        be recollected. The House was instantly pulled down, and with the whole of its Contents 
                                        committed to Flames, amidst the general Acclamations of all his other Negroes. In regard
                                        to the old Woman, he declined bringing her to Trial under the Law of the Island, which
                                        would have punished her with Death; but from a Principle of Humanity, delivered her into
                                        the Hands of a Party of <name>Spaniards</name>, who (as she was thought not incapable of doing some
                                        trifling Kind of Work) were very glad to accept and carry her with them to Cuba. From the 
                                        Moment of her Departure, his Negroes seemed all to be animated with new Spirits, and the
                                        Malady spread no farther among them. The Total of his Losses in the course of about Fifteen
                                        Years preceding the Discover, and imputable solely to the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct>, he estimates
                                        at the least, at One Hundred Negroes.

                                <p><name>Obeah-men</name> are the oldest and most artful Negroes; a Peculairity marks them, and every
                                    Negro pays the greatest Respect to them, they are perfectly well acquainted with medicinal
                                    Herbs, and know the poisonous ones, which they often use. To preposess the Stranger in
                                    favour of their Skill, he is told that they can restore the Dead to Life; for this Purpose he
                                    is shewn a Negro apparently dead, who, by Dint of their Art, soon recovers; this is produced 
                                    by administering the narcotic Juice of Vegetables. On searching one of the <name>Obeah-men's</name>
                                    Houses, was found many Bags filled with parts of Animals, Vegetables, and Earth, which
                                    the Negroes who attended at the Sight of, were struck with Terror, and begged that they
                                    might be christened, which was done, and the Impression was done away. In consequence 
                                    of the Rebellion of the Negroes in the Year 1760, a Law was enacted that Year to render the
                                    Practice of <name>Obiah</name>, Death.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Influence of the Professors of that Art was such as to induce many to enter into that
                                    Rebellion on the Assurance that they were to be invulnerable, and to render them so, the
                                    <name>Obeah-men</name> gave them a Powder with which they were to rub themselves.
                                </p>
                                <p>On the First Engagement with the Rebels Nine of them were killed, and many Prisoners
                                    taken: Among the Prisoners was a very sensible Fellow, who offered to discover many 
                                    important Matters, on the condition that his Life should be spared, which was promised. He then
                                    related the Part the <name>Obeah-men</name> had taken, One of whom was capitally convicted and 
                                    sentenced to Death.
                                </p>
                                <p>At the Place of Execution he bid defiance to the Executioner, telling him that it was not
                                    in the Power of White People to kill him; and the <rs type="properAdjective">Negro</rs> Spectators were astonished when
                                    they saw him expire. On the other <name>Obeah-men</name>, various Experiments wer made with Exectrical
                                    Machines and Magic Lanthorns, which produced very little Effect; except on one who,
                                    after receiving many severe Shocks, acknowledged his Master's <name>Obeah</name> exceeded his own.

                                <p>I remember sitting Twice on Trials of <name>Obea-men</name>, who were convicted on selling their
                                    Nostrums, which had produced Death. To prove the Fact, Two Witnesses are necessary,
                                    with corroborating Circumstances.

                                    them to explan the Nature of the Evidence, which as been generally required for constituting
                                    a legal Conviction in such Cases.

                                        in the Capacity of Butler or Waiting-man. The Infant which was nursed by One of these
                                        Women happened to die. Her Misbehaviour after this was such as obliged her Master to
                                        turn her out of his House, and she was ordered to work among the Field Negroes, The
                                        Butler, who was her own Brother, highly incensed at this, shewed some Symptoms of 
                                        Discontent, which were not much regarded; but, in the course of a few Days, the Water of a
                                        Well from whic hthe Family had their daily Supply, was observed to be very much discoloured, 
                                        and intolerably fetid. His Master, imagining these might be the natural Effects of
                                        Stagnation, ordered the Well to be drawn till it was supposed to be nearly drained. But 
                                        notwithstanding this Operation, the Water still continued ill-coloured, nauseous to the Taste,
                                        and offensive to the Smell. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male">A Man</ecda:anonPers> was then let down, who brought up a <distinct rend="italic">white Fowl</distinct> in a

                                        On further Examination, a large Quantity of <distinct rend="italic">Indigo Seed</distinct> was fished up from the
                                        Bottom of the Well. These Circumstances occasioned Suspicions of some Mischievous Design.
                                        The Houses of all the Negroes were Searched, and at one of them, inhabited by a
                                        near Relation of the Butler, a <distinct rend="italic">Calibash</distinct> or Bowl was found, out of which a <distinct rend="italic">greenish Liquid</distinct>
                                        had been recently emptied. This Circumstance brought to mind, that a Phial containing a
                                        Liquid of similar Appearance, had been noticed in the Butler's Pantry, who, upon the first
                                        Rumour of a Search, had conveyed it away. Still it was undecided upon whom the Suspicion
                                        ought to fall, till the Cook came voluntarily to his Master (apprehensive for his own
                                        Safety, if Poison should be privately thrown into any of his Dishes), and gave positive

                                        Plantation. This Woman fell suddenly into a Decline, without any known Cause, and languishing
                                        for some Time, contracted at length a very morbid Habit of Body. <ecda:anonPers a-gender="male" a-occupation="doctor">The Doctor who
                                        attended her</ecda:anonPers>, and tried a Variety of Medicens without any good Effect, declared it beyond
                                        his Power to afford her any Reliev, and pronounced her incurable. When her Death was
                                        every Day expected, and after much Importunity to discover the Cause of her Disorder, she 
                                        was prevailed on to confess that her Husband, from a violent Suspicion of her Infidelity to
                                        him, and on her sturdy Denial of the Charge, had obliged her <quote rend="quotes">to take Swear</quote> (as she
                                        called it), by drining a Mixture of <distinct rend="italic">Grave Dirt</distinct> and <distinct rend="italic">water</distinct>, accompanied by the usual
                                        Imprecation (that her Belly might swell and burst, and her Bones rot, if she was guilty). She
                                        concluded with deploring the miserable End to which she had brought herself by denying the 
                                        Fact, for that she really had been false to him. Intelligence of this Confession was given to
                                        her Husband's Master, who sent immediately for him, and representing the Perin in which he
                                        stood under the Law of the Land, which had declared the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Practice</distinct>, with <distinct rend="italic">Grave Dirt</distinct>,
                                        a capital Offence, advised him to go directly to his Wife, and endeavour to cajole her into a
                                        Belief, that it was nothing more than a sly Contrivance of his own to get at the truth: That
                                        the Mixture she had swallowed was not made with <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Dirt</distinct>, but only with a little common
                                        Earth, which he had picked up on the rad, and therefore it was very harmless. The Fellow
                                        (who had owned the Fact to his Master) joyfully took his Advice, and acted his Part so
                                        well , that the poor Woman was completely duped a second Time, and recovering her Spirits,
                                        was soon restored to perfect Health.

                                    <p>If this Woman had died, the Evidence of her Declaration would not have been deemed

                                        his own free Confession of the Fact, he would have escaped with Impunity. The singular

                                    who has sat upon the <mcr>Two</mcr> Trials, we beg leave to deliver the same in his own Words, and
                                    as a Supplement to what we have already had the Honour of submitting.

                                <p>In the Year <date when="1760">1760</date>, the Influence of the Professors of the <distinct rend="italic">Obiah Art</distinct> was such, as to induce a 
                                    great many of the Negro Slaves in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> to engage in the Rebellion which happened in
                                    that Year, and which gave rise to the Law which was then made against the Practice of <distinct rend="italic">Obiah</distinct>.
                                </p>
                                <p>Assurance was given to these deluded People, that they were to become invulnerable; and
                                    in order to render them so, the <name rend="italic">Obiah-men</name> furnished them with a Powder with which they were 
                                    to rub themselves.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the First Engagement with the Rebels, Nine of them were killed, and many Prisoners
                                    taken; amongst the latter was One very intelligent Fellow, who offered to disclose many
                                    important Matters, on conditin that his Life should be spares, which was promised. He then
                                    related the active Part which the Negroes, known among them by the Name of <name rend="italic">Obiah-men</name>,

                                    at that Time, various Experiments were made with Electrical Machines and Magic Lanthorns,
                                    but with very little Effect, except on One, who, after recieving some very severe Shocks,

                                    occasioned the Death of the Parties to whom they had been administered; notiwthstanding which
                                    the Lenity of their Judges prevailed so far, that they were only punished with Transportation.
                                    To prove the Fact, Two Witnesses were deemed necessary, with corroborating Circumstances.

                                Plantations have been formed, and are still forming, in the mountainous and interior or central
                                Parts, where vast Numbers of Horned Cattle, Horses and Mules, are annually bred, pastured
                                or fattened.

                            <p>We observe in Jamaica a great Variety of Soils—The Cane thrives best in deep rich
                                Mould, and on a Clay Bottom, and where Showers are frequent.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the old Estates, which have been under Culture for these 100 Years or upwards,
                                Manure in great Abundance is absolutely Necessary. Those Situations where Canes thrive
                                Best, are in general the very worst for Cotton and Coffee, which will not answer where
                                Rains and Floods are frequent, or the Soil very wet. The far greater Part of the Land at

                            <p>What Difference is there in the Produce per Acre of different Plantations in the same

                            <p>In answering this Inquiry, several general Observations must be premised in reference to
                                <placeName rend="italic">Jamaica</placeName>.
                            </p>
                            <p>1st. The Difference of Product so far as depends on unequal Supply of Rains.</p>
                            <p>The Two grand periods of the Year, when the rainy Seasons (or great Rains) are
                                commonly expected, are May and October; and when those Supplies arrive with Regularity (but
                                of late Years the May Season has too frequently failed) the Distribution of Rain, though not
                                equal in all Parts of the Island, is yet universal; but between these Two Periods, a due
                                Frequency of Showers is requisit for each Sugar Estate, in order to sustain Vegetation, and these
                                are very unequally bestowed, depending not only on the Direction in which the Mountains
                                and Hills are ranged, but on the Point from which the Wind may happen to blow; and on
                                the Extent of the Clouds; for it very often happens that an Estate from its particular 
                                Situation, receives Showers for several Days, when the next adjoining Estate, from its
                                Difference in Position in respect to the High-lands, Winds, &amp;c. does not get a Drop.
                            </p>
                            <p>2dly, is to be considered the essential Difference which arises from the difference of Skill and
                                Attention in manuring, planting, weeding, moulding, and the general Operations in
                                this Respect, as well as in the other manufacturing Process, by which the greatest possible
                                Quantity of Sugar is to be extracted.
                            </p>
                            <p>These Considerations being premised, the rest must depend upon the Quality of Soils,
                                which, in Jamaica, are various in each District at large, and almost equally so on the major 
                                Part of the Estates themselves. We believe that the Average Produce, One Year with another,
                                of the whole Island does not amount to much more than Half an Hogshead of Sugar per
                                Acre; particular Spots may yield much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Inquiry perhaps ought, for greater Satisfaction, to be directed to such Gentlemen
                                as are now residing in the Island.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Difference of Produce per Acre on different Plations is very great; much in
                                this Respect depends on the Difference not only of Soil but Mode of Management.
                            </p>

                            <p>By what Causes are Crops on different parts of the same Island partially affected?</p>
                            <p>In Jamaica, by partial Rains, partial Droughts, Floods, and Hurricanes, the Blast and
                                Rats, not to mention the great Disparity occasioned by more or less Skill in Management,
                                or by the healthy or unhealthy state of the Labourers, or their Adequacy or inadequacy in
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                point of Number to the present Crop, because seasonable or unseasonable Weather will
                                increase or diminish the Crop, and the Labour necessary to take it off.
                            </p>
                            <p>It frequently happens, that some Parts of this Island are materially injured by Droughts,
                                strong Winds, and other Causes, while other Parts experience very seasonable Weather.

                            <p>Does the Quantity of labour, which is necessary to require from the Negroes, vary
                                materially in different Parts of the Year, as it does here in Harvest Time, &amp;c. and is there
                                any Period at which the increased Labour produces any particular Effect on the Health of
                                the Negroes?
                            </p>
                            <p>The System of Sugar-making must be considered in its progressive State, as calling for
                                successive operations throughout the Year, as
                                <list>
                                    <item>1st Ploughing.</item>
                                    <item>2d. Holing, manuring, and trenching.</item>
                                    <item>3d. Moulding, weeding, and trashing.</item>
                                    <item>4th. Cutting, grinding, boiling, and curing.</item>
                                    <item>5th. Carting to the Shipping-place.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>Of these several Operations, that of holing and planting is by no means the most laborious;
                                but as it is often unavoidably obliged to be performed in showery Weather, the Negroes, if
                                too much exposed to it, may be liable to obstructed Perspiration and Fevers; but most of the 
                                Planters have moveable Tents or Sheds, which are set up in the Fields, for the Purpose of
                                protecting them from the Effects of heavy Showers.
                            </p>
                            <p>In point of Labour, the Fourth Operation is so far from being oppressive or injurious to
                                the Negroes, that they enjoy better Health in general during the Crop Season (which lasts
                                about Five Months) than at any other Time: This may in Part be ascribed to their free Use
                                of the Cane Liquor (resembling Sweet Wort) and the more settled or drier weather during
                                that Season of the Year.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Work of the Negro Slave in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is far less than that of a Labourer in <placeName>Britain</placeName>;
                                they have in general 15 Hours in 24 to themselves, which is quite sufficient for Sleep, and for
                                cooking and eating their Victuals, to say nothing of Recreations.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Labour of Slaves varies much at different Seasons of the Year: Digging Cane
                                Holes is Considered as the hardest Labour; so long, however as the Slaves continue at that

                                Morning, and Rum and Water in the Afternoon. Crop-time (our Harvest) may be deemed
                                hard Labour, as the Work in the Boiling-house is continued Day and Night; but the
                                Slavesdo not so consider it; and indeed, by the free Access they are allowed to the
                                Liquor in the Boiling-house, in the course of its Manufacture into Sugar, the Slaves 
                                universally thrive.

                            <p>Would it be possible to cultivate to Advantage the <placeName>West India Islands</placeName>, by the Labour of 
                                <name>Europeans</name>, or of Free Negroes?
                            </p>
                            <p>We think it impossible with <name>Europeans</name>: So far as Experience can determine, we find that
                                the same Exposure to the Sun, which cheers the <name>African</name>, is mortal to the <name>European</name>; Nine in
                                Ten of them would die in Three Years.

                            <p>As to Free Negroes;—in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> no Free Negro was ever yet known to hire himself, or be
                                employed in Agriculture upon the Sugar Plantations: The Men are averse to labour the
                                Ground even for themselves; and whenever they do it, it is only to supply their immediate
                                Wants: They have all the Vices of Slaves, and no Planter could controul them.

                            <p>What is the Disposition of the Free Negroes with respect to Labour, particularly continual

                            </p>
                            <p>We can only repeat what we have before said—that no Free Negro in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> was every yet
                                known to hire himself, or be employed in Agriculture of any Kind.

                            <p>Vide their Answer, Nº 37.</p>
                            <p>The Negroes are univerally disposed to be slothful and indolent; they are in general no
                                longer disposed to work than while they find it necessary to do so for immediate Subsistence;
                                there are however some Exceptions.

                                for cultivating a West India Plantation?
                            </p>
                            <p>We have every Reason to believe it would not: The Nature and Constitution of an <name>European</name>
                                are not so well adapted to retain even Life, much less to support Field Labour, either in the

                            <p>Is the Labour of Cattle, and of what Species and in what Proportion, used in the Cultivation
                                of a <placeName type="properAdjective">West India</placeName> Plantation?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, Oxen in general are used in ploughing, where ploughing is practicable; some
                                (but they are few) make use of Horses for the same Purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>Mules are chiefly used for Carriage on steep Acclivities and bad Roads; in other Places the
                                Carriages are drawn by Oxen.—The Mills are turned by Wind, Water, Mules, Oxen, or
                                Horses.
                            </p>
                            <p>Horned Cattle are used on many Sugar-works, in Ploughing and harrowing the Land;
                                and on all, the Cattle and Mules are used in carrying the Canes to the Mill, Manure to the
                                ground, Copper-wood to the Works, and any other Draught-labour where they can possibly
                                be applied: The Labour of Slaves is, however, absolutely necessary, after the Plough, to 
                                prepare the Land for the Plant.
                            </p>

                            <p>Could the Quantity of Cattle be increased, and could their Labour be substituted for that of
                                Slaves in a greater Extent than it is at present?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> the Quantity of Cattle is daily increasing, and may certainly be increasted
                                very considerably, by continuing to open and settle new Breeding Farms: How far the Assistance
                                of Cattle, in the Cane and other Culture, can be extended beyond what is at present, may
                                depend on a Variety of Circumstances, best learnt, by inquiring on the Spot; for it is 
                                presumed, that there are some thousands of Acres new in Culture, which, from their rocky and 
                                inacessible Nature, cannot be worked by the Plough; and many more thousand Acres yet
                                in the Wilderness, on which, when Cleared, the Plough may probably be usefully employed:
                                Cattle, we believe, are already employed in all the Operations of the <placeName type="properAdjective">Jamaica</placeName> husbandry to
                                which their Assistance is applicable.
                            </p>
                            <p>There is a Sufficiency of Cattle in this Island for Work, and also for the Butcher, and
                                considerbaly more than could be maintained but for the Introduction of Guinea Grass.
                            </p>
                            <p>No Negro-labour is applied, when it is possible to substitute the Labour of Cattle or 
                                Mules.

                                and as the Plough is coming daily into more general Use, the Labour of the Slave is likely to

                                without Roads, and underexplored; Error was probably unavoidable, and there is not a
                                Doubt at present, but that their Computation was greatly exaggerated; nor can we say more
                                in favour of subsequent Accounts, than that they are to be considered as mere Opinions of
                                Individuals, unfounded upon geometrical Process; that Island therefore has been lengthened
                                or contracted in its Dimensions, at various Times, by the Caprice of different Authors, as
                                a few out of a great many Examples will shew, viz.

                            <p>In the various Accounts we have of the Dimensions of this Island, there appears a Difference
                                of no less than 40 Miles in Length and 20 in the Breadth; nor have the astronomical
                                Observations, taken at different Periods, been more fortunate in adjusting the Longitude of
                                the Eastern and Western Extremities, for they make a Difference amounting to One Degree in
                                the former and 57 Minutes in the latter.

                                for accurate Computation can be obtained, no positive Exactness is to be hoped for.

                                allows 160,000 Acres for the Cane Land; but it is certain that from this Mode of Statement,

                                that there may be about 200,000 Acres for an annual Crop of 100,000 Hogshead,s at Half

                                public Statement, Cultivation has been considerably extended, Settlements multiplied, and
                                Products increased; but as this Question, and the Two succeeding ones, lead into a very
                                minute Investigation and Detail; we are sensible, were we to offer vague Conjecture,
                                instead of substantial Information, it would be very unsatisfactory; and we have only to lament
                                our Want of sufficient Lights to guide us in such multifarious Inquiries, which we think may
                                be made in the Island itself with better Success.

                            <p>The additional Heads of Inquiry, it is presumed, were inteded more immediately to be
                                answered from the Leeward Islands; the Magnitude and Extent of this Island make it difficult
                                to answer them with Accuracy. It is supposed the whole Number of Acres in this Island
                                is about 3,500,000, of which One-fifth may be in Cultivation; and Three-fifths of the
                                Remainder capable of being so.

                            <p>We cannot speak as to the exact Number, but can only say, that the Plough is very commonly,
                                though not universally, in use in Jamaica.—A more precise Answer can only, we
                                think, be obtained by Inquiry among the Planters resident there.

                            <p>The Plough has been used upon a great many Plantations, for the Purpose of preparing the
                                Land; but it is not possible to say on how many, with Precision, as the Use of the Plough
                                has been, and is now, increasing daily, as has been already said in the Answer to the 42d Quære of
                                the Heads of Inquiry.

                            <p>The making of sufficient Manure every Year is a very important Article of Husbandry in
                                Jamaica, and upon which the Crops of all the old Estates depend.
                            </p>
                            <p>The same Sort of Manure is made use of here as in England, except Lime; but the most
                                general Way of manuring is, to pen or fold the Cattle upon such Lands as are meant to be
                                replanted.

                            <p>If in general the Planters were to employ Mules and Cattle in carrying out the Manure,
                                would it not be for the Advantage both of the Negroes and the Owners?
                            </p>
                            <p>On the <sic>the</sic> Sugar Estates in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, we believe that the Manure is invariably carted out to
                                all the accessible Lands, and the Steeps are usually dressed by means of the moveable Cattle-
                                penns described in the preceding Answer. We do not know of any Sugar Estate in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>,
                                where the Practice exists of carrying or laying on Manure in any other Manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Manure was never carried in this Island in any other Way than by Cattle and Mules.</p>

                            <p>Upon any Plantation with a given Stock of Negroes, and yielding on an Average a certain
                                annual Quantity of Sugar, what may be supposed to be the net Income to the Owner, if living
                                on the Island, after deducting the Charge of maintaining and clothing his Negroes, the
                                Wear and Year, and other necessary Expences? And what the net Income to the Owner
                                living in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>?
                            </p>
                            <p>In <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, the Expences and Profits of a Sugar Planttion depend on the local Situation,
                                the Distance of Carriage to and from the Market or Shipping-place, the Goodness or Badness
                                of the Orads; the comparative Advantages of a Windmill, Watermill, or Cattlemill; the
                                Facility of procuring Wood, or the heavy Charges of importing Coals for Fuel; the Labour
                                required uopon the Estate, the knowing how to direct and apply that Labour to the best Effect,
                                and to preserve the Labourers and their Offspring, and the Cattle, in the fullest Health and Vigour;
                                the Fecundity of the Soil; the Skill of the Planter; in the best-adapted Husbandry; in preparing
                                the raw Material, and in working it up; the Credit and Independence of the Planter, wehreby he is
                                enabled to purchase, with more or less Advantage, the requisite Supplies for the carrying on
                                and Support of his Plantation; the Sagacity and Judgment of the Planter in choosing the
                                most eligible Factor for the Sale of his Produce. Such a Diversity in Talents, Circumstances,
                                and Management of each Estate, make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to answer the
                                first Part of this Question. As to the rest, the Planter who does not reside in the Island,
                                differs from the resident Planter only by having more Deficiency Tax to pay, which is proportioned
                                to the Size of his Family, and a Commission to the Person who has care of the Property
                                during such Absence, both of which operate upon the non-resident Planter as an Absentee
                                Tax.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is apprehended, that upon an Average throughout the Island, the Planter dos no make
                                more than Four per Cent. upon his Capital.

                            then stood: The Second, Third, and Fourth Columns, are the Alterations that have been made
                            since that Time. I have added at the End of the Act of <date when="1681">1681</date>; but as it does not distinctly appear
                            in that Act, whether the Servants mentioned therein are Negroes, or indented Whies, I have

                        <p>I have also added some of the Clauses of the French Code Noir, to save their Lordships
                            Trouble; as by this Means they may immediately compare their Code with our Jamaica Code, and
                            may be acquainted with the Reasoning of the French upon the Necessity of the Employment of
                            Negro Slaves in the Sugar Colonies, which will be found in Page (29), Column 2, of the Abstract
                            of the French Code Noir, at the End of the Appendix.

                            <p>The House went into a Committee on the Consolidated Slave Bill, and continued to sit
                                upwards of Three Hours. We understand, that by this Bill, the whole System of the Law
                                respecting Negroes is intirely changed. A Council of Protection is established in each Parish;
                                and many humane Provisions are introduced, for rendering their Condition as easy and happy as
                                possible. It is also made Felony, without Benefit of Clergy, to murder a Slave: A Clause
                                which, to the great Honour of the House, passed without a single dissenting Voice.

                            <p>It has been asserted with Confidence that Barbadoes was cultivated by White People.
                                I have my Doubts about it.
                            </p>
                            <p>An English Ship was drove into that Island by Accident.</p>
                            <p>The Earl of Carlisle's Patent passed.</p>
                            <p>Twenty Years afterwards Richard Ligon arrived there. He found that Sugar-making was
                                then but newly practised; and that whilst he lived in the Island there were reckoned in it
                                about 50,000 Souls, not including the Negroes, who were thought to amount to more than
                                double the Number of Christians. He arrived in September 1647; the Inhabitants were at
                                this time so greivously afflicted with a pestilential Diorder, viz. the Yellow Fever, that before
                                a Month was expired after his Arrival, the living were hardly able to bury the dead. He spent
                                about Three Years in the Island, he was advised, upon Enquiry, to purchase a plantation
                                ready stocked with Servants, Slaves, Horses, Cattle, &amp;c. Colonel Modiford, who was a 
                                Passenger in Ligon's Ship, immediatly treated with Major William Hilliard for Purchase of his
                                Plantation, viz.

                            <p>From the above Account I am unavoidably led to conclude, that 200 Acres in Canes could
                                not be cultivated by 28 White Servants; and finding that there were 96 Negro Slaves upon it
                                at the same Time, and that this was only at 23 Years at most after our first setting foot upon
                                that Island, it seems perfectly clear to me that the Island of Barbadoes was cultivated by Negro
                                Slaves, and not by White People, as it has been asserted (I think) without Foundation.

                            <opener>Mr. Speaker,</opener>
                            <p>Your Committee appointed to examine into, and report to the House, the various Allegations
                                and Charges, which, by the Letters of our Agent, and the Minutes of the House of Commons
                                of Great Britain, appear to be containted in a great Number of Petitions presented to that
                                Honourable House on the Subject of the Slave Trade, and the Treatment of the Negroes in this
                                and the rest of his Majesty's Sugar Colonies; to report the Proceedings and Resolutions of the
                                British Parliament thereon; and further, to consider whether it may be proper of the House to
                                adopt any, and what Measures on this important Occasion, and to report their Opinion thereon
                                to the House; do report,
                            </p>
                            <p>That it appears to your Committee, from the Minutes of the British House of Commons,
                                that Petitions have been presented from different Corportations, and respectable Bodies of Men
                                in Great Britain, praying the Interposition of Parliament in abolishing the Slave Trade; wherein
                                may of the said Petitioners, not content with stating the various Abuses in the Transportation of
                                Negroes from Africa, have ventured to bring forward many general unqualified Allegations, in 
                                respect of the Condition and Treatment of Slaves employed in the Cultivation of this, and
                                others of his Majesty's Colonies in the West Indies; charging, that the People so employed are
                                either exposed to the arbitrary Will of avaricious and unfeeling Task-masters, without any Protection
                                or means of Redress, even in the Cases of the most atrocious Injury, or placed under the 
                                Dominion of a most merciless and tyrannical System of Laws; that these Laws are executed
                                with Rigour and Brutality; that our Slaves are destroyed in a few Years by long and painful
                                Labour, and a Want of the common Necessaries of Life; and that the Result of such Treatment 
                                is, that our Slaves decrease, instead of increasing, in a Climate perfectly congenial to their
                                own.
                            </p>
                            <p>And it further appears to your Committee, That, in consequence of such Petitions, the House
                                of Commons did, on the Ninth of May last, come to the Following Resolution: <quote rend="quotes">That this
                                House will, early in the next Session of Parliament, proceed to take into Consideration the 
                                Circumstances of the Slave Trade complained of in the Petitions now lying upon the Table, and
                                what may be fit to be done theron;</quote> and that a Bill was brought in, for providing certain
                                temporary Regulations respecting the Transportation of Slaves in British Bottoms from the Coast of
                                Africa; which Bill has since passed into Law.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your Committee are of opinion, That the Principle of the said Act of the British Parliament
                                is founded in Justice, Humanity, and Necessity; and that the Provisions adopted therein, when
                                further matured by the Wisdom of Parliament, must ultimately prove highly beneficial to the
                                Sugar Colonies, inasmuch as it is notorious, that Vessels have been frequently corwded witha
                                greater Number of Negroes than they ought in Prudence to have contained. And it is the
                                Opinion of the Committee that the Wisdom and Authority of Parliament might be beneficially
                                exerted, in further Regulations of the African Commerce; particularly in preventing the Detention
                                of Ships on the Coast; in prohibiting the Purchase of Slaves who shall appear to have been 
                                kidnapped, or deprived of Liberty contrary to the Usage and Custom of Africa; and in compelling
                                the said Ships to transport an equal Number of both Sexes, and to provide Ventilators 
                                and a sufficient Quantity of Provisions, especially Water. It seems not to be understood in Great
                                Britain, that the Inhabitants of the West India Islands have no Concern in the Ships trading
                                to Africa. The African Trade is purly a British Trade, carried on by British Subjects residing
                                in Great Britain of Capitals of their own. The Connection and Intercourse between Planters of
                                this Island, and the Merchants of Great Britain trading to Africa, extend no further than the mere
                                Purchase of what British Acts of Parliament have declared to be legal Objects of Purchase.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your Committee are further of opinion, That as to the Charges and Allecations brought against
                                us, with regard to the Treatment and Situation of Slaves in this Island, it is necessary and easy to 
                                disprove the same, by demonstrating, 1st, That Negroes in this Island are under the Protection of
                                lenient and salutary Laws, suited to their Situation and Circumstances: 2d, That the Slave Laws are
                                executed with Humanity, Mildness and Mercy: 3d, That the Laws have made Provision to
                                grant Slaves Days of Rest, and to prevent their being in want of the Necessaries of Life: and
                                4th, That the Decrease of our Slaves does not arise from the Causes alleged in the Petitions
                                presented to the British House of Commons, but from various other Causes not imputable to us,
                                and which the People in Great Britain do not seem to comprehend.
                            </p>
                            <p>And your Committee are of opinion, That to disprove the said Charges and Allegations,
                                it is proper to recommend to the House, to grant the Committee Power to send for Persons,
                                Papers, and Records, and to examine all Persons that shall come before them in the most solemn
                                Manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Ordered, that the said Committee have Power to send for Persons, Papers, and Records, and
                                to examine all Persons that shall come before them, in the most solemn manner.

                            <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
                            <p>Your Committee appointed to examine into, and report to the House, the various Allegations 
                                and Charges which, by the Letters of our Agent, and the Minutes of the House of Commons
                                of Great Briatin, appear to be contained in a great Number of Petitions Presented to that 
                                Honourable House on the Subject of the Slave Trade, and the Treatment of the Negroes in this
                                and the Rest of his Majesty's Sugar Colonies, and for other Purposes, have, in pursuance of the
                                Powers granted them by the House on their First Report, proceeded to collect Evidence to
                                disprove the said Charges and Allegations, by demonstrating, 1st, <quote rend="quote">That Negroes in this
                                Island are under Protection of lenient and salutary Laws, suited to their Situation and 
                                Circumstances.</quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>On this Subject we have to observe, That it appears by the Letters of our Agent, that certain 
                                Head of Inquiry were transmitted to him a few Months ago from a Committee of the Lords
                                of his Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council, many of which related to the Condition and
                                Government of our Slaves, and in Answer thereto an Abstract of most of our ancient Slave Laws
                                was laid before their Lordships; to which, if necessary, Reference may be had; but it seems
                                not to have been understood by our Agesnt, that in 1781 many of those Laws were repealed, and
                                all the subsisting Laws, and Clauses of Laws, respecting the Order and Government of Slaves,
                                were consolidated and brough into One Act. This act is known by the Name of the Consolidated
                                Slave Act, and having expired on the 31st Day of December 1784, has since been
                                renewed with Amendments. By the said Act of 1781, Clauses 2d and 3d, all Possessors of 
                                Plantations are obliged, under 50l. to allot Provision Grounds for each of their
                                Slaves, to allow them sufficient Time to work the same, and also to keep in proper Cultivation
                                One Acre of Land at least for every Four Negroes, in Plantain Walk and Ground Provisions;
                                exclusive of the Negroes Grounds, and in case the Owners or Possessors have not Hands proper
                                for that Purpose, they are required to make some other ample Provision for the Support of their
                                Slaves.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause the 4th it is enacted, That every Master, Owner, or Possessor of Slaves, shall, under
                                the same Penalty, provide and give to each Slave proper and sufficient Clothing to be approved
                                of by the Justices and Vestry of the Parish.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 5th, Slaves giving Information of Thefts, or other Crimes and Misdemeanors, are
                                entitled to pecuniary Rewards; which is One Proof, among others, that our Laws consider
                                Slaves and capable of holding Property, and will protect them therein.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 6th, the Penalty of 100l. is laid on any Master or Owner who shall mutilate or
                                dismember any Slave or Slaves.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 7th it is enacted, That in case any Person shall mutilate any Slave the Property of
                                another, such further Punishment should be inflicted, exclusive of the aforesaid fine, as the
                                Court shous think proper, and at the same Time the Owner of the injured Slave is allowed to
                                pursue his Remedy for Damages at common Law.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 8th, any Person, wantonly beating a Slave, not his own Property, is liable to be
                                indicted for the same, and punished by Fine and Imprisonment.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 28th, further Security was given to Slaves, by altering the Mode of Trial of such
                                as stood charged with capital Offences; for by former Laws such Trials were directed to be held 
                                before Two Justices and three Freeholders indiscriminately chosen; whereas by the said act of 
                                1781 it was enacted that the Freeholders on such Trial should be chosen by Ballot, and out of a
                                Number not less than Five.
                            </p>
                            <p>When we reflect that many of these Clauses were Provisions of our ancient Laws, and in particular
                                that the Penalty on the Master who should mutilate or dismember his Slave was enacted
                                so long ago as the Year 1717; and when we consider further that the said Act of 1781 was in
                                full force until 31st December 1784, we cannot sufficiently express our Astonishment and Concern
                                that respectable Bodies of Men should have subscribed their Names to Allegations, which a
                                little Inquiry must have convinced them were totaly groundless.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the 31st of December 1784, the Consolidated Slave Law of 1781 (as hath been already observed)
                                expired, and as it appears by the Minutes of the House that on the 20th Day of October
                                1784, a Committee was appointed to bring in a Bill to revive and continue the same; but so many
                                Improvements and Amendments were proposed for giving further Protection and Security to
                                Slaves, particularly in the Mode of Trial for capital Offences, that it was thought advisable to
                                disperse throughout the Island printed Copies of the new Bill, with the intended Alterations, in
                                order that the full Sense of the Country thereon might be collected against the next Session of
                                Assembly: Much pressing Business prevented it passing into a Law in 1785 and 1786, and in
                                1787 the Assembly was dissolved; but the new Assembly, which met in October 1787, among 
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                the first Objects of their Attention, took the Subject into their Consideration, and passed the 
                                Consolidated Slave Bill which is now in force, wherein, among other Improvements and Amendments
                                to the Act of 1781, it may be sufficient to enumerate the following:
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 4th, regulations are made to prevent Slaves being deserted in future by their
                                Owners, on account of Age and Infirmity; and by a subsequent Clause the Justices and Vestry of
                                each Town and Parish empowered to lay a Tax upon the Inhabitants for providing Food, medical
                                Care and Attendance on Slaves already deserted by their Owners, and who are disabled from
                                Labour, by Sickness, old Age, or otherwise. And in order more effectually to enforce the 
                                Regulations of Former Laws respectng the Subsistence and Clothing of Slaves, it is enacted by Clause
                                6th, That every Master, Owner, or Attorney, shall under Penalty of 50l. give in to the Vestry,
                                on Oath, an Account of the Quantity of Land in Ground Provisions (over and above the Negro
                                Grounds) for the Use of their Slaves; or in case there are not Lands proper for the Purpose, an
                                Account on Oath of the Means adopted for the Maintenance and Support of their Slaves, and
                                also under the like Penalty give in an account of the Clothing actually served to each Slave.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 9th, The Penalty on Persons mutilating or dismembering their Slaves is increased,
                                by adding to the Fine of 100l. inflicted by former Laws, the Punishment of imprisonment, not
                                exceeding Twelve Months, and in certain Cases mutilated Slaves are to be declared Free; andin
                                all such Cases the Court is authorised to direct that the Fien of 100l. be paid over to the Justices
                                and Vestry of the Parish, who in consideration thereof are to allow to such Slave declared free
                                10l. per Annum for Maintenance and Support during Life. By the same Clause the Justices and
                                Vestry are appointed a Council of Protection, for the purposes of making full Inquiry into the
                                Mutilation of Slaves, and for prosecuting to Effect such Owner or Owners as may have been
                                guilty thereof, And by Clause 10th it is enacted, That in case any Information is made before
                                any Justice of the Peace, that any Slave or Slaves is or are mutilated and confined, it shall and
                                may be lawful for such Justice of the Peace, as he is required to issue his Warrant to the Marshal
                                or Constable, to bring the Slave or Slaves before him for Inspection.
                            </p>
                            <p>By this Regulation the Power of Concealment is endeavoured to be taken from the Owner; for
                                as it is not required that the Information shoudl be on Oath, the Magistrate is enable to obtain
                                a View of the Fact on Evidence, which in other Cases is and ought to be inadmissible.
                            </p>
                            <p>By Clause 11th is enacted, That is any Person shall murder any Slave, whether his own
                                Property of not, he shall suffer Death for such Offence.
                            </p>
                            <p>And in order more effectually to prevent the Destruction of Negreos by excessive Labour and
                                unreasonable Punishments, the Surgeon of every Plantation, by a subsequent Clause, is required to
                                give in on Oath to the Justices and Vestry, an annual Account of the Decrease and Increase of
                                the Slaves of such Plantation, with the Causes of such Decrease, to the best of his Knowledge,
                                Judgment, and Belief.
                            </p>
                            <p>On his Head the Committee cannot but remakr how tender and cautious every rational Manager
                                must necessarily be, in the Punishments which he administers, who considers that the has a
                                resident Inspector into his Conduct, and that the Punishments of Death may follow and Abuse of his
                                Authority.
                            </p>
                            <p>Neither does the Law extend its protection to the industrious and faithful Negro only; Provision
                                is made for the Support of such Fugitives and Criminals as are apprehended and lodged in 
                                the Gaols and Workhouses of this Island; the daily Allowance of good and wholesome Food
                                required, by Clase 31st, to be given to every Slave in Confinement, being abundantly liberal,
                                and as we conceive unexampled in most other Countries to unhappy Persons in similar 
                                Circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p>Having this briefly stated the Protection which the Laws of this Island have provided for our
                                Slaves in the grand Circumstance of personal Safety; we now proceed to the Secon Head,
                                namely, to prove <quote rend="quotes">That the Slave Laws in this Island are executed with Humility, Mildness,
                                and Mercy.</quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>By the Slave Laws here alluded to, we understand the Laws and Clauses of Laws which assign
                                Penalties and Punishments on such Offences and Transgressions of our Slaves as affect the Public;
                                and in order to obtain the fullest Information on this Head, we have called on the several Clerks
                                of the Peace of the different Precincts and Parishes for Returns of all Trials of Slaves, with the
                                Charges, Conviction, and Punishment, severall had thereon, for several Years last past, viz. from
                                the 1st of January 1784, to the 30th of September 1788. From these Returns we are enabled
                                to state the following Circumstances:
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Parishes and Precinct of St. Catherine, St. John, St. Dorothy, and St. Thomas in the
                                Vale, containing 21,772 Slaves, the Number of capital Convictions and Executions were Four
                                only in the said Interval.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Parish of St. Andrew, containing 9,613 Slaves, we find only One Execution in the said
                                Interval.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Parishes and Precinct of St. Thomas, in the East, and St. David, containing 23, 272 Slaves,
                                the Number of capital Convictions and executions were Ten in the said Interval.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Parishes and Precinct of St. Mary, and St. George, contianing 22,194 Slaves, the
                                Number of Capital Convictions and Executions were Four in the said Interval.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Parish of St. Ann, containing 12,324 Slaves, the Number of capital Convictions and
                                Executions were Two in the said Interval.
                            </p>
                            
                            <pb/>

                            <p>In the Parishes and Precinct of Clarendon, and Vere, containing 22,234 Slaves, The Number of

                            <p>In the several Towns and Parishes of Kingston, Port Royal, and Portland, containing 12,928 
                                Slaves, there do not appear to be any capital Convictions within the said Period, but the Records
                                of Trials in the Town of Kingston previous to 1787 are not to be found.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Total appears to be 52 Executions in Four Years and Nine Months, which is not more than
                                Eleven per annum, for the last Five Years, out of 210, 894 Slaves.—A Proof of Lenity in the 
                                Execution of our Criminal Laws, not to be surpassed, as we conceive, by any Nation in Europe.
                                Nothing further, therefor, seems necessary to be added on this Head, except the 40th Clause of the
                                present Consolidated Slave Bill, which directs, That in all Cases where the Punishment of Death
                                is inflicted, the Execution shall be performed in a public Part of the Parish, and with due
                                Solemnity; and Care shall be taken by the Gaoler, or Deputy-Marshal, that the Criminal is free from
                                Intoxication at the Time of his Trial, and from thence, to and at the Time of his Execution,
                                under the Penalty of 5l.: And the Mode of such Execution is directed to be, hanging by the Neck, and
                                no other. It is likewise provided, That where several Slaves are capitally convicted for the same
                                Offence, One only shall suffer Death, except in Cases of Murder or Rebellion.
                            </p>
                            <p>But the Committee cannot quit this Subject without observing, That the Number of Negroes at
                                this Time actually living within this Island, is much greater than appears on the Tax Rolls from
                                exempt Persons who have not more than Six Negroes from the Payment of Taxes on Slaves, whereby
                                many of the Negroes (especially in the Towns) are not given in to the different Vestries, and the
                                Returns of a great many other are fraudulently concealed. We judge, after diligent Investigation,
                                that the whole Number of Negro Slaves now actually in the Island, are 240,000 at the least.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the Third Ground of Inquiry we are to demonstrate, That the Laws have made Provision to
                                grant Slaves Days of Rest, and to Prevent their being in want of the Necessaries of Life.
                            </p>
                            <p>Although we conceive that this Assertion has been sufficiently established by the Recital already
                                given of such Clauses of our Laws as relate to the Subsistence of our Slaves, yet as the Words
                                <quote rend="quotes">sufficient Time</quote> in one of the Clauses referred to, left a discretionary Power in the Master, we
                                shall take occasion, in a subsequent Part of our Report, to show that the Legislature has provided a
                                Remedy against any possible Abuse of such discretonary Authority.—But the Further Discussion of
                                this Subject is deferred until we treat of the new Slave Bill passed the present Session.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the Fourth and Last  Ground of our Researches, namely, to demonstrate, <quote rend="quotes">That the Decrease
                                of our Slaves does not arise from the Causes assigned in the Petitions presented to the British House
                                of Commons, but from other Causes not imputable to us, and which the People of Great Britain
                                do not seem to comprehend;</quote> the Committee, after diligent Inquiry and Investigation, are of
                                opinion, that the following are the principal Causes to which the alleged Decrease of our Slaves
                                ought justly to be imputed:—First, The Disproportion between the Sexes in the annual Importations 
                                from Africa. Second, The Loss of new Negroes on, or soon after their Arriveal, from epidemic
                                Diseases brought from Africa, or contracted in the Voyage.
                            </p>
                            <p>Respecting the First of these Causes, the Committee have examined the most considerable African
                                Factors residing in this Island as to the relative Numbers of Males and Females impored and sold
                                annually for several Years past; and it appears from the Examination of Robert Hibbert, Esquire,
                                a Member of this House, that of 16,254 Negroes omported and sold by Messrs. Hibberts and
                                Jackson between the Years 1764 and 1774, 10,149 were Males, and 6,145 Females. It likewise
                                appears from the Examinations of Messrs. Coppells, and Messrs. Rainsfords, Messrs. Mures and
                                Dunlop, and Alexander Lindo, Merchant, that out of 32, 881 Slaves sold by them collectively
                                within these Seven Years last past, the Number fo Males was 20,487, and of Females, 12 394.
                                The Relative Proportion of the whole is Five Males to Three Females.
                            </p>
                            <p>We have annexed to this Report, Extracts from the Books of the aforesaid Factors, as 
                                produced by them to this Committee, and from which the above statement is formed. They are
                                marked as Nº 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
                            </p>
                            <p>With respect to the Second Cause of such Decrease, our Inquiries for the present have been
                                confined to the Number of new Negroes, that have perished in the Harbours of this Island, between
                                the time of their having been reported at the Custom-house and the Day of Sale; all which
                                are included in official Books and Returns as Negroes actually imported. From the Examination
                                of Mr. Lindo it appears, that out of 7,873 Negroes consigend to him as Factor in the Years
                                1786, 1787, and 1788, and reported at the Custom-house, no less than 262 perished in the
                                Harbour of Kingston before the Day of Slae; and if the same Proportion of Deaths be allowed to
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                the whole of the Africans imported since the Conquest of the Island to the present Time (an 
                                Allowance which, on many Accounts, we conceive to be moderate), the Numbers that have thus
                                persished are very considerable. We have thought it necessary to investigate this Circumstance
                                with as much Precision as the Subject will admit; and having, from the Books of the Receiver-
                                General, and other sufficeint Authorities, procured the most exact Account that can be formed 
                                of the Imports and Exports of Negroes into and from this Island from the Year 1655 (the Time
                                of its Conquest) to December 1787, we find the Imports to amount to 676,276 Negroes; of
                                which according to the Proportion above stated, no less than 31, 181 will appear ot have died on
                                Ship-board after Entry, although they stand in the Books of Office as constituting Part of the
                                actual Numbers supposed to have been distributed among the Planders, and destroyed by Neglect,
                                excessive Labour, or other Mal-treatment.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Committee are of opinion, that these Data lead to important Conclusions; for if the
                                Negroes that have perished as above, and the further Number of 160,449 (being the Total of
                                the Exports), making together 191,627, be subtracted ferom the Total of the Imports, it will 
                                appear, that the full Number of Slaves which have been introduced and lef in the Country from
                                the Conquest of the Island to December of 1787, is reduced to 484, 649. Of this Number, if a
                                Further Reduction of Two-fifths be made (which most have happened in any Cuntry, and under
                                any System of Government) to bring the Sexes to an Equality, the Balance is 290, 791. A further
                                Reduction must likewise be made for Negroes that have deserted from their Owners, and left
                                the Island; many Hundreds within these few Years having been inveigled over to Cuba, and
                                great Numbers have been stolen by Privateers in Times of War; others are annual carried to
                                Europe, and shipped off the Island by their Owners, of which no Account is preserved; exclusive
                                of such as were executed and transported in the several great Rebellions, and such as have
                                been transported for other Offences by the Sentence of the Law. It is impossible to ascertain
                                with Precision the Result of these several combined Causes; but we concieve that a Loss of
                                13,000 Negroes at the least bay be justly assigned to them since the first Settlement of the Island,
                                which is not quite an Average of a Hundred per Annum, and which brings the Remainder to
                                277,791. On the other Hand, to the Number of 140,000 Negroes actually living in the Island
                                on the 31st of December 1787, as before stated, must be added to the People caled the Maroons,
                                amounting by the last Returns, to about 1300; and also all the Free Negroes, and People of
                                Colour; the latter as being Descendents from the Black Females fo the original Stock.
                            </p>
                            <p>It is not easy to ascertain either of these Classes, with any Degree of Precision, from the Tax-
                                rolls, or from the Law, which requires Free Negroes, to take out Certificates, and wear the Badge
                                of their Freedom, as the Law is very seldom complied with; many of the Free Negroes considering
                                the Badge rather as a Token of Disgrace than a Mark of Distinction. We judge, on a
                                loose Computation, that the Free Negroes and People of Colour, of all Ages, and both Sexes,
                                cannot amount ogether to less than 500 in each Parish on an Average of the whole, which gives
                                10,000. The Total is 251,300, which, being subtracted from 277,791, leaves 26, 491 as the
                                Number which would have decreased since the Year 1655, under all Circumstances, and supposing
                                even that the Sexes had been eaually distributed.
                            </p>
                            <p>We shall now point out the principal Causes to which this Mortality is justly chargeable. It
                                is but too well known to the House, that in the several Years 1780, 1781, 1784, 1785, and
                                1786, it pleased Divine Providence to visit this Island with repeated Hurricanes, which spread
                                Desolation throughout most Parts of the Island; but the Parishes which suffered more remarkably
                                than the rest were those of Westmoreland, Hanover, St. James, Trelawny, Portland, and 
                                St. Thomas in the East. By these destrutive Visitation, the Plantain Walks, which furnish the
                                chief Article of Support to the Negroes, were generally rooted up; and the intense Droughts
                                which followed destroyed those different Species of Ground Provisions which the Hurricanes had
                                not reached. The storms of 1780 and 1781 happening during the Time of War, no foreign
                                Supplies, excepting a trifling Assistance from Prize Vessels, could be obtained on any Terms; and
                                a Famine ensued in the leeward Pars of the Island, which destroyed many thousand Negroes,
                                After the Storm of the 30th July 1784, the Lieutenant Governor, by the Advice of his Council,
                                published a Proclamation, dated the 7th of August, permitting the free Importation of
                                Provisions and Lumber in Foreign Bottoms for Four Months from that Period. As this was much
                                too short a Time to give sufficient Notice, and obtain all the Supplies that were necessary, the
                                small Quantities of Flour, Rice, and other Provisions, which were imported in consequence of
                                the Proclamation, soon rose to so exorbitant a Price as to induce the Assembly, on the 9th of
                                November the following, to present an Address to the Lieutenant Governor, requesting him to prolong
                                the Term until the latter end of March 1785; observing, that it was impossible for the
                                natural Productions of the Country to come to such Maturity as to be wholesome Food before
                                that Time. The Term of Four Montsh not being expired when this Address was presented,
                                the Lieutenant Governer declined to comply therewith; but, on the 1st of December following,
                                the House represented, that a Prolongation of the Term was then absolutely necessary. They
                                observe, That, persuaded wof the Reluctance with which his Honour would be brought to deviate
                                from Regulations which e felt himself bound to observe, it would give them much Concern to
                                address him on the same Occasion a second Time, were they not convinced that it was in a
                                Case of such extreme Necessity, as to justify such a Deviation. Accordingly the Lieutenant
                                Governor, by the Advice of his Majesty's Council, directed, that the Time formerly limited
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                should be extended to the 31st of January then ensuing (1785); but at the same Time
                                he informed the House, that he was not at liberty to deviate any longer from the Regulations
                                which had been established in Great Britain.
                            </p>
                            <p>From the 31st of January 1785, therefore, the Ports continued shut, and the Sufferings of th
                                poor Negroes in consequence thereof, for some Months afterwards, were extreme; providentially
                                the Season became more favourable about May, and considerable Quantities of Corn and Ground 
                                Provisions were gathered in by the Month of August, when the Fourth Storm happened, and the 
                                Lieutenant Governor immediately shut the Ports against the Exportation of any of our Provisions
                                to the French and Spanish Islands, which were supposed to have suffered more than ourselves; but
                                not thinking himself at liberty to permit the Importation of Provisions in American Vessels,
                                the Productions of the Country were soon exhausted, and the usual Attendants of scanty and 
                                unwholesome Diet, Dropsied and epidemic Dysenteries, were again dreadfully prevalent in the Spring
                                and Summer of 1786, and proved fatal to great Numbers of the Negroes in all Parts of the 
                                Country.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the 20th of October in that Year happened the Fifth dreadful Hurricane, which again
                                laid waste the leeward Parihes and completed the Tragedy. We decline to enlarge on the
                                Consequences which followed, lest we may appear to exaggerate; but having endeavoured to
                                compute, with as much Accuracy as the Subject will admit, the Number of Slaves, whose
                                Destruction may be fairly attributed to these repeated Calamities, and the unfortunate Measure
                                of interdicting foreign Supplies, and for this Purpose compared the Imports and Returns of
                                Negroes for the last Seven Years, with those of Seven Years preceding, we hesitate not, after
                                every Allowance for adventitious Causes, to fix the whole at 15,000. This Number we firmly
                                believe to have perished of Famine, or of Diseases contracted by scanty and unwholesome Diet,
                                between the latter End of 1780, and the Beginning of 1787.
                            </p>
                            <p>But the most general and prevailing Causes of the Decrease of our Slaves, and which are
                                abundantly sufficient to account for the Loss which is not already accounted for, are palpable to
                                every Observer; they are undoubtedly, First, the great proportion of Deaths that happen among
                                Negroes newly imported (exclusively of the Mortality which has been stated to occur before
                                landing); and secondly, the Loss which prevails among the Negro Infants that are born in the
                                Country. Of the latter it is believed, that One-fourth Part perish within Fourteen Dasy of the
                                Birth; but we can form no precise Estimate of the proportionate Loss of new Negroes, inasmuch
                                as the Diseases with which many of them are afflicted put on various Appearances, and are of a
                                tedious and lingering Nature, and may therefore be such as are common both to the new Negroes
                                and the old. Nevertheless, in order to collect the best Information in our Power on Subjects so
                                interesting to the Community, we have thought it necessary to take the Examination thereon of
                                some Gentlemen who are eminent in the Knowledge and Practice of Physic and Surgery, To
                                these Examinations, whic hare marked Nº 6, 7, and 8, the Committee refer, and are happy to observe,
                                that it is extremely probable the Regulating Act lately passed by the British Parliament,
                                when further matured, will greatly contribute to lessen in future that dreadful Mortality which
                                there has been so much Cause to lament, as well in the Voyages from Africa, as among the
                                Negroes after their Arrival in the West Indies. With such happy Consequences resulting from
                                the beneficial Provisions of the said Act of the British Parliament, and the Encouragement which
                                has been given, by a Bill passed in this Island this present Session, to the Overseers of our Plantations,
                                to induce them to take all possible Care of the new-born INfants, as will hereafter be more
                                particularly mentioned; the Committee have no Reasn to suppose that the Increase of our Negroes
                                by Generation (from the Time that the Sexes shall become nearly equal in point of Number)
                                will fall short of the natural Increase which occurs among the labouring Poor of Great
                                Britain.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Committee might here conclude their Report; but having referred to a new Bill, which
                                has passed the House this present Session, for giving further Protection and Security to our Slaves,
                                adn for altering the Mode of Trial of such as shall be charged with capital Offencesl we think
                                ourselves called upon, in Justice to the House, to subjoin an Abridgement of the principal Clauses
                                and Provisions contained therein.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Distinguishing Feature of this Bill, as the Title imports, is the Alteration in the
                                Modes and Trials of our Slaves, by referring all capital Offences to the Jurisdiction of the
                                Courts of Quarter Session which are held every Three Montsh in the several Precincts and Parishes
                                of the Island. By this Regulation the Offender will have the Security both of grand and petit
                                Jury, and even the Suspicion of Partiality or undue Influence will be obviated. It is further
                                enacted, That no less than Three Justices, One of whom to be of the Quorym, shall consitute
                                a Court at the Trial of Slaves at the Quarter Sessions; and that if the Jury apply to the Court to
                                suspend the Execution of the Sentance until the Pleasure of the Commander in Chief is known,
                                the Court shall be obliged to suspend the same for Thirty Days.
                            </p>
                            <p>Petty Offences, for which no punishment exceeding Fifty Lashes, and Six Months Confinement
                                to hard Labour, is assigned, are cognizable before Two Justices of the Peace; and it is
                                expressly declared, That neither the Courts of Quarter Session, nor the Justices, shall have Power
                                to order any Slave to be mutilated or maimed for any Offence whatsoever.
                            </p>
                            <p>By another Clause Encouragement is given to all Masters and Mistresses, Owners, or in their
                                Absence, Overseers of Slaves, as much as in them lies, to endeavour the Instruction of their
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                Slaves in the Principles of the Christian Religion, thereby to facilitate their Conversion, and fit
                                them for Baptism; and as soon as conveniently they can, they shall cause to be baptised all such
                                as they can make sensible of a Deity and the Christian Faith.
                            </p>
                            <p>Another very important Object of this Bill is, the Correction of Two material Errors which had
                                been accidentally made in the Consolidated Slave Bill of last Year; the Words <quote rend="quote">without Benefit
                                of Clergy,</quote> in the Clause which assigns the Punishment of Death to Persons wantonly killing
                                a Negro, or other Slave, having been undesignedly omitted, there are now restored. And another
                                Clause in the said Consolidated Slave Bill, which inflicted Punishments on Persons wantonly and
                                cruelly beating Slaves, and imprisoning them without sufficient Support, having been interpreted
                                not to extend to such Slaves as were the Property of the Offender, has been amended, and the
                                Protection which it affords is now extended to all Slaves without Distinction.
                            </p>
                            <p>Futher, in the View of Restraining arbitrary Punishments, it is by the said Bill enacted, That
                                no Slave, on any Plantation or Settlement, or in any of the Workhouses or Jails in this Island, 
                                shall receive more than Ten Lashes at One Time, and for One Offence, unless the Owner, Attorney,
                                Guardian, Executor, Administrator, or Overseer of such Plantation or Settlement, or
                                Supervisor of such Workhouse, or Keeper of such Jail, shall be present; and no such Owner,
                                Attorney, Guardian, Executor, Administrator, or Overseer, Supervisor or Jail-keeper, shall on
                                any Account punish a Slave with more than Thirty-nine Lashes at One Time and for One Offence,
                                under Penalty of 5 l. for every Offence, to be recovered against the Person directing
                                or permitting such Punishment.
                            </p>
                            <p>Another Object of this Bill, as hath been already observed, is, to secure to our Slaves Days of
                                Rest, and sufficient Time to cultivate their Grounds, in order to prevent their being in want of
                                the Necessaries of LIfe; for which Purpose, after reciting, that althoug it hath been customary
                                with the Planters in this Island to allow their Slaves One Day in every Fortnight (exclusive of
                                Sundays), yet this Indulgence not being compulsory, it is enacted by the said Bill, That the Slaves
                                belonging to, or employed on every Plantation or Settlement, shall, over and above the usual
                                Holidays allowed them at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, be allowd One Day in every
                                Fortnight, to cultivate their own Provision Grounds (exclusive of Sundays), except during th
                                Time of Crip, under the Penalty of 10l. to be recovered againt the Overseer, or other Person
                                having the Care of such Slaves. And,
                            </p>
                            <p>Lastly, with Intention to prevent, as far as possible, the great Mortality which as been stated
                                to prevail among the new-born Negro Infants, it is also enacted, that in case it shall appear to 
                                the Satisfaction of the Justices and Vestry of each Parish, from the Returns required to be
                                made annually, that there has been a natural Increase in the Number of Slaves on any such Plantation,
                                Penn, or other Settlement, the Overseer shall be entitled to receive from the Owner or
                                Proprietor of such Plantation, Penn, or other Settlement, the Sum of Twenty Shillings for every
                                Slave born on such Plantation, Penn, or Other Settlement, and which shall be then living at the
                                Time of giving in such annual Returns; and the Owner or Proprietor of such Plantation, Penn,
                                or other Settlement, shall have a Deduction from the first of his or her public Taxes that shall
                                become due, of the Sum so paid to the Overseer, on producing a Certificate of the Justices and
                                Vestry of such Increase, and a Receipt of the Overseer for the Sum so paid.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your Committee cannot conclude without observing, that if, notwithsatanding all that we have
                                urged in our own Vindication from the groundless Charges that have been made on our Humanity
                                in the Treatment of Slaves, it shall be determined by the British Parliament to abolish
                                trust in the Justice of the British Nation, that we shall not be made the Sacrifice on this 
                                Occasion, but that the Legislature will give us such a compensation as the consequent Diminution
                                in the Value of our Properties, and their ultimate Destruction, shall entitle us to expect. We
                                have the greater Reason to indulge this Expectation from the Justice that has been done to the
                                late Proprietors of Florida, and also to such of the African Merchants as would be Sufferers by
                                the late Regulations.

                            <head>The Examination of James Chisholme, of the Parish of Clarendon, formerly a Member
                                of this House.
                            </head>
                            <p>Saith, That he studied Physic at Edinburgh, hath practised in this Island upwards of Twenty
                                Years, and that during Fourteen Years of the Time, he hath had the Care of 4000 Negroes and
                                upwards.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That a great Proportion of Negro Infants perish between the Fifth and Fourteenth Days
                                after their Births, he believes nearly One-fourth Part of all that are born. The Species of 
                                Tetanus by which so many Negro Children are destroyed, is described by medical Writers under the
                                Name of Opisthotunus, or that Kind of Spasm in which the Muscles that bend the Spine backwards,
                                with those of the lpwer Jaw, are affected. It is commonly ascribed to One of the Three
                                following Causes: 1st, An Affection of the Bowels arising from the Meconium of Fœces (lodged
                                there before Birth) not being sufficienty purged off. 2dly, From obstructed Perspiration. 2dly,
                                From the Irritation occasioned by the improper Treatment of the Sore remaining after the umbilical
                                Chord has dropped off. He is of opinion, it seldom or never proceeds from the first Cause;
                                for it is a very common Custom with the Midwives to give the Children a good deal of Oil
                                and Sugar soon after they are born, by which they are much purged: Notwithstanding Children
                                so treated are frequently attacked with this Complained, besides Bowel Complaints, whether in
                                Children or Adults, though they frequently occasion Convulsions, and sometimes Palsy, yet he
                                believes they never occassion fixed Spasm. In regard to the second Cause, although he makes no
                                doubt it may occasion this Complaint in Children, as he has certainly seen it do in Adults,
                                yet he is inlined to think it seldom does. His Reasons are, that when this Complaint takes place
                                in Adults from obstructed Perspiration, it generally runs out to a great Lenth, and is not
                                generally fatal; whereas the Complaint in the Infant we are now treating of, always terminates
                                in a few Days, and is almost universally fatal. Further, this Compalint in Infants constantly
                                makes its Appearance between the Fifth and Fourteenth Day after Birth; but Children are not
                                more subject to Colds at that than at any other Period. The Third Cause appears generally.
                                if not in every Instance, to occasion this Disorder; it is universally known, that whatever villicates
                                or irritates the minute Brances of Nerves, whether by Puncture, Laceration, Burning, or Friction
                                on a raw Place, will in tropical Climates, occasion this Complaint even in Adults, but much
                                more readily in the tender Bodies of Infants. We also know, that in Negro Children, after the
                                umbilical Chord has fallen off, the raw Part, after being slightly covered with Lint or Rag, is
                                bound round with a coarse Cloth, and that in a few Hours is soaked in the Child's Urine, in
                                which State it is suffered to remain, producing a Degree of Irritation, much more than sufficiant
                                to produce this Spasm. When it is considered this Complaint takes place between the Fifth and
                                Fourteenth Day only, it must be allowed to be excited by some Cause that is also confined to the
                                same Period; but the Cause just mentioned is the only one that occurs at no other Period in Life,
                                as far as we know.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That if he is right in his Theory respecting the Cause of this Complaint, it will be
                                supposed that the Remedy is obvious, as it will be only directing a greater Attention to be paid
                                to the Dressing and Cleanliness of the Infant during the Period above alluded to; but simple as 
                                this may appear in Theory, those who are much conversant with Negroes will be aware of the
                                Difficulty, if not Impossibility, of putting it in practice in a Degree sufficient to answer the
                                Purpose; for such is the Ignorance, Obstinacy, and Inattention of Negroes, so little Regard have
                                they for each other, and so averse are they to executing the Directions of White People, when
                                repugnant to their own Prejudices, that he believes the Evil can never be wholly remedied, while
                                we are obliged to employ Negroes as Nurses.
                            </p>
                            <p>Being asked, Whether he hath not observed a great Mortality among Negroes newly imported,
                                and to what Cause or Causes he imputes the same,
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That a very great Number of newly-imported Negroes are lost by Diseases, the predisposing
                                Causes of which they bring to this Country along with them. Most new Negroes, when 
                                first landed, are much subject to putrid Complaints arising from a scorbutic Habit contracted
                                during the Voyage, which frequently manifests itself soon after they are landed in putrid 
                                Dysenteries, or by Foul Ulcers tending strongly to Mortification. Many Negroes, while aboard, are
                                afflicted with the most virulent venereal Complaints, others have the Yaws, some malignant Ulcers;
                                all of which, when the Day of Sale draws near, are, by the Management of the Ship's Surgeon, 
                                dried up, and the morbid Matter repelled into the System, so that the Surface of the Skin
                                shall appear clean and smooth for a Time; but which afterwards creates the most dreadful 
                                Complaints, too frequently baffling all Attempts to cure.

                            <p>Saith, That he had the Rudiments of Physic and Surgery in Aberdeen: That he afterwards
                                studied at Edinburgh, Leyden, and London, and has practiced Physic in this Island upwards
                                of Twenty-eight Years, and formerly, with a Partner, had the physical Care of near Four 
                                Thousand Slaves.

                            <p>Examinant is of opinion, That One-fourth Part of the Negro Infants perish before the
                                Ninth Day from the Birth, of the Tetanus or locked Jaw, a Disorder which the Negroes call the
                                Jaw-fall; and that its affecting Infants of that Age is peculiar to the West Indies: That he is of
                                opinion, One-tenth Part of the White Infants perish in the same Manner.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That he made the Inquiry when in Great Britain about Four Years ago, and
                                could hear of no such Disorder: That he is warranted to say, it is peculiear to the West Indies,
                                from a late Publication of the famous Dr. Cullen of Edinburgh, who, in treating of the locked
                                Jaw in Infants, says, <quote rend="quotes">He speaks only from Information, for he never met with it in the Course
                                of his Practice.</quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That he has made Inquiry among the most sensible Negro Women, and
                                that he never could learn the Disorder was known in Africa.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant faith, That he imputes the Cause to the Irritation of a putrid matter generated at
                                the Separation of the umbilical Chord, previous to the Separation, which generally happens from
                                the Fifth to the Seventh Day: That the Disorder may likewise proceed from Cold, or the Meconium
                                not being properly carried off, but these Causes occur very seldom: That the First Symptom
                                is an Uneasiness in the Infant, and Refusal of the Breast. In the course of a few Hours the Jaw
                                closes, a general Spasm takes place, and Death commonly ensues in the course of Twenty-four
                                Hours: That immediately before Death, a general Relaxation comes on, and the lower Jaw falls
                                on the Breast; thence called Jaw-fall by the Negroes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That he does not believe the Disorder in general is owing to any improper
                                Mode of Treatment of the Infant, as he has often known it occur notwithstanding the greatest
                                Care; and that, from the Rapidity of the Disorder, and the tender Age of the Patient, he knows
                                of no certain Remedy that succeeded, either from the Application of Opiates or any other 
                                Medicine, once in Twenty Times: That it occurs in hight and healthy Situations as well as in low 
                                ones; in mountainous Districts, as well as those near the Sea-side.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That great Losses are sustained in the Increase of Negroes from the Length
                                of Time the Negro Women continue their Children at the Breast, seldom less than Two Years,
                                and many of them more: That there is no remedying this Evil without great Discontent; as the
                                Mother, during the Time of her being a Nurse, is commonly allowed an Hour in turning out
                                to Labour later than the other Negroes, and returning an Hour earlier from Labour.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant is of an opinion, That many Negro Children die of that Distorder, peculiar to the
                                Africans, called the Yaws, particularly if they are infected during the first Year, which the
                                Mothers in general attempt to effect, on Purpose to excuse themselves from Labour.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant is of opinion, notwithstanding those Inconveniences already enumerated, there is
                                a very considerable Increase of Negroes on the Properties of this Island, particularly in the Parish
                                where he reisides.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinant saith, That the Losses sustained in seasoning newly-imported Negroes are chiefly
                                owing to the many Disorders they bring with them from Africa, or contracted on board Ship, such
                                as Venereals, the Yaws, and old habitual Ulcers.
                            </p>
                            <p>Examinat saith, the Number of obstinate Cases he has met with, induced him to inquire of
                                Surgeons that had been in that Trade, respecting their Mode of Treatment during the Voyage;
                                and that he has been informed it was customary to suppress Venereals with astringent Injection,
                                to cause the Yaws and ulcers to disappear by escarotic Washes; and on the Day of Sale, or a
                                few Days before, to hid the Scars with blackening and Palm Oil: That the epidemic Dysentery 
                                is frequent on board Ship; and though the Surgeions have a Method of concealing it on the Day
                                of Sale, in some Measure, by Atringents, yet it frequently breaks out after the Negroes are
                                landed with double Fury, of which he remembers the following remarkable Instance; Mr. Colin
                                Campbell, out of St. Ann's, having bought Thirty Negroes in Kingston, and endemic Dysentery
                                broke out among them soon after their Arrival at the Plantation, of which Twenty-four of them
                                died; the Disorder was communicated to the rest of the Negroes on the Plantation, and several of
                                them likewise fell a sacrifice to it.

                            <head>The Examination of John Quier, Practitioner in Physic and Surgery.</head>
                            <p>Saith, That he studied Surgery in London, and Physic at Leyden, and served his Majesty
                                as an Assistant Surgeon in the Military Hospitals, in the former War, in Germany: That
                                he has practiced in this Island for upwards of Twenty-one Years: That for the greater Part of
                                that Time he has had from 4 to 5000 Slaves Constantly under his Care in the Parishes of
                                St. John and St. Thomas in the Vale, and of late Years in the Parish of Clarendon.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That the local Circumstances attended Difference of Situation in this Island, occasion
                                so great a Diversity in the Diseases to which the Inhabitants of different Parts of this Country
                                are Subject, that the very few Observations thereon will be found to be universally true: that <choice><sic>heh as</sic><corr>he has</corr></choice>
                                not in general obseved any very great Mortality amongst Negro Infants soon after their Birth,
                                in that part of the Country where he practices; nor any peculiar Disease, to which they are more
                                subject than any other Children would be under the same Circumstances; namely, First, The
                                known Want of Cleanliness, arising from the obstinate Attachment of Negro Women to their
                                old Customs; particularly to one so evidently mischievous in a warm Climate, as that of not
                                shifting the Child's Cothes for the first Three Days after its Birth; and sometimes from a
                                Deficiency of Linen, and other Necessaries proper for a new born Infant. Secondly, The Nature
                                of their Habitations, sometimes suffocating with Heat and Smoke; at tohers, when the Fire
                                subsides, especially by Night admitting the cold damp Air through innumerable Crevices and
                                Holes of the Walls, which are seldom kept in proper Repair; which sudden Transition from
                                Heat to Cold, by occasioning peripneumonic Fevers, he thinks to be the most general Cause of
                                the Death of new-born Negro Infants in that Part of the Country where he practices. And,
                                lastly, the injudicious Custom of suckling a new-born Child for the first Week after its Birth, or
                                longer, with the Milk of a Woman who often has a Child at her Breast a Year old, or perhaps older.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That in his Opinion difficult Labours happen as frequently among Negro Women here,
                                as amongst the Females of the labouring Poor in England; but that he has not observed that a
                                greater Proportion of the Infants of the former perish in the Delivery than of the latter.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That he does not conceive the Tetanus, or locked Jaw, to be a Disease common to
                                Infants in the Part where he practices: That he apprehends there may be Reason to suppose that
                                a Symptom, which generally attends approaching Death, from whatever Cause it may proceed
                                in Children, viz. a Paralysis of the Muscles of the lower Jaw, has been frequently mistaken, by
                                People acquanted with Medicine, for the Tetanus; as he has often observed the same Name
                                to be given in common Discourse to both those Affections, though of so different a Nature.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That Negro Women, whether Slaves or Free, do not in his Opinion breed so frequently
                                as the Women amongst the labouring Poor in Great Britain: That he ascribes this
                                chiefly to the promiscuous Intercourse which the greater Number of Negro Women indulge
                                themselves in with the other Sex: That he believes the Abortions, which he thinks to be rather
                                frequent amongst them, to be ascribably to the same Cause: That he has not bet with any Cases
                                of Abortion which he could fairly impute to ill Usage or excessive Labour: That moderate
                                Labour is beneficial to pregnant Women, as being the best Means of preserving general Health.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That the Custom of carrying young Children into the Field in the Manner and with
                                the Precautions it is now practiced, is by no means hurtful to the Infants.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That he believes that a greater Number of Children under the Age of Ten Years
                                die here than in England: That there are some Disorders to which Children are more liable than
                                Adults: That the Yaws, a Disease originally African, occasion Numbers of them to perish:
                                That Worm Complaints are more frequent here than in England; and the same epidemical
                                Diseases which are incident to Children in Europe, viz. the Small Pox, Measles, and Whooping
                                Cough, are equally common to Negro Children here, and in a severer Degree. Moreover, that
                                from the frequent shifting of the Connexion between the Sexes, many Children are lost through
                                Neglect and the Want of maternal Affection, which the Mothers seldom retain for their Offspring
                                by a former Husband.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That in his Opinion any Attempt to restrain this licentious Intercourse between the
                                Sexes amongst the Slaves in this Island, in the present State of their Notions of Right and
                                Wrong, by introducing the Marriage Ceremony amongst them, would be utterly impracticable
                                and perhaps of dangerous Consequence, as these people are universally known to claim a Right
                                of disposing of themselves in this respect, according to their own Will and Pleasure, without
                                any control from their Masters.
                            </p>
                            <p>Saith, That a greater Proportion of those called New Negroes die, than of those that are
                                seasoned to the Country. That in his Opinion this is often occasioned in those recently
                                imported, by the mad Habit of the Body these People have contracted from long Confinement,
                                bad Food, and improper Treatment in the Voyage. That within these last Twenty Years the
                                Treatment of new Negroes in this Island has been greatly altered for the better. That those
                                People are now in general treated with great Humanity and Tenderness, both before and after
                                they are become seasoned to the Country; and that he does not conceive the great Mortality
                                amongst them commonly to arise from want of Food or severe Labour.

                                <p>By his Majesty's Packet, Greyhound, which arrived here on the 25th ultimo, I had the Honour
                                    to receive your Lordship's Letters of the 17th of September, and the 2d of October last; and by
                                    his Majesty's Packet Roebuck (dispatched by Express), which arrived here on the 29th ultimo, I 
                                    had the HOnour to receive Mr. Nepean's Letter of the 17th of October.
                                </p>
                                <p>From the Minutes of Council herewith transmitted, your Lordship will perceive that I lost no
                                    Time in taking the necessary and most effectual Steps to procure full and satisfactory Information
                                    upon the several Heads of Inqiry relative to the Slave Trade, and the Treatment of Negroes in
                                    these Colonies; and from their extensive Nature, and the Danger of giving Misinformation upon a
                                    Subject of so much Importance, I conceived that too much caution could not be obseved in 
                                    procuring it, which has been the Cause of my not sooner having it in my Power to submit it to
                                    your Lorship. I fear it will still be found defective; but this, with such Information as has
                                    already been furnish by the Report of a Committee of the Assembly upon this very interesting
                                    Subject, is, I believe, all that can be had from this Quarter which may at all be relied on; and I
                                    hipe it will arrive soon enough to meet any Discussion upon the Merits of it in Parliament. I
                                    need not add the Anxiety of all Ranks of People upon this Occasion: They conceive the Prosperity
                                    or Ruin of the Island to depend upon the Issue of a Question in whic their All is involved; and
                                    I cannot, under such Circumstances, withhold my Testimony against the apparent Misrepresentations
                                    upon wich the Clamour relative to them appears to be founded in England.

                                <p>This is another very pernicious Custom which the imported Africans bring with them to Jamaica,
                                    and it is more frequently remarked among the <distinct rend="italic">Popos</distinct> than the Natives of any other Country;
                                    but we do not affirm positively that Negroes from other Parts of Africa may not likewise be
                                    addicted to it: The Earth which they search for, and devour with so much Avidity, is a
                                    saponaceous Marle. We are told that Cakes of a similar Earth are publicly sold at some of the
                                    African Markets; and it is probably in Imitation  of that Practice, that <distinct rend="italic">Aboo</distinct>, or Earth-Cakes,
                                    are vended among the Negroes at Spanish Town in Jamaica. They are composed of a particular
                                    Earth, some Strate of which are to be found near the North-Eastern Extremity of that Town,
                                    adjoining to the Rio Cobre. The favourite Species of it in Jamaica is this described by

                                    Substance say that it is sweetish. Many of them acquire a Habit of eating it to such Excess,
                                    that it often proves fatal to them <emph>It is a most certain Poison</emph> when used for any Length of Time;

                                <p>A planter having not long since purchased Ten Negroes just imported from Africa, the Party
                                    on their Way to his Plantation, chanced to espy a Vein of this Earth in a Bank by the Side of
                                    the Road, and shouted for Joy at the Discovery.

                                <p>It is doubtful whether their Fondness of this Substance be the Occasion or the Consequence of
                                    a depraved Appetite. Some Plantations there are where no such Practice exists; but it is almost
                                    certain that it exists wheresoever a Vein of this Species of Earth happens to be discovered by any
                                    Negro whose Experience enables him to distinguish it. In Jamaica they prever waht is gathered
                                    from the Beds of Rivers, as more free by its Dilution from the Intermixture of other Earths. In
                                    its fresh and moist State it is of a brownish Colour, and has somewhat the Appearance of
                                    ordinary Castile Soap, but after having been perfectly dried it turns white. Young Children are
                                    equally greedy of it; they either learn the Habit from Example of their Parents, or are regaled
                                    with it as a Dainty, or as an Antidote to Acidities or Pains in the Stomach, to which they are
                                    very subject: For the latter Purpose it may likewise be frequently taken by the older Negroes.
                                    It is certain that this Abuse, from whatever Motive it proceeds, adds largely to the annual
                                    Death roll of Jamaica.

                                <p>A Plantation in the Parish of Westmoreland happened to be incumbered with an heavy
                                    Mortgage, which (after many Years Neglect of the Proprietor) was foreclosed, and the Negroes
                                    sold.
                                </p>
                                <p>The former Owner died soon afterwards, and left a Widow, One Son, and Two Daughters, in
                                    very distressed Circumstances.—Upon hearing of their unhappy Situation, the Negroes had a 
                                    Meeting, and agreed to pay an Annuity for the Support of their old Master's Family.—Not long
                                    since, the Son was observed by one of the Negroes, passing through the Plantation; and on his
                                    declaring his Poverty, the same Negroes assembled again, dispatched a Messenger to a Shop for 
                                    Clothes and Linen, and made up a little Purse for him of Three Pounds. This was entirely an
                                    extra Bounty; for as to the Annuity which they had agreed upon for Support of the Family, they
                                    continued paying it regularly to a Day.

                                <p>Another Planter of that Island having, in consequence of several protested Bills, been sued for a
                                    very considerable Amount, for which Judgments were obtained, and Writs isued against the Property;
                                    his Negroes assembled before his Door, and expressing their Concern, they offered him a
                                    large Sum of Money, whic hthey had brought ready tied up on Bags bade of old Stockings, and
                                    said, if the Money was insufficient, they could borrow as much more among their Friends and
                                    Relations. What the Sum total was, the Gentleman did not know, because he declined accepting
                                    their generous Offer; but the Bags were <emph>large</emph> and <emph>heavy</emph>.

                                <p>Both of these Accounts were communicated to Mr. Long, in the Year 1779, by a Correspondent

                                <p>The late Sir Charles Price having purchased Twenty newly-imported Negroes, had them
                                    brought before him to be reviewed soon after their Arrival at the Plantation where he intended to
                                    settle them.
                                </p>
                                <p>As soon as they were all collected and arranged for this Purpose, he could not help being
                                    particularly struck with the Appearance of one Man, whose Looks bespoke a mind that was labouring
                                    under some severe Affliction.—An irresistible Curiosity prompted him to enquire among the Plantation
                                    Slaves for one of the same Country, who might perform the Office of Interpreter: A Female
                                    Linguist was soon found, who put several Questions to the African, dictated by her Master, but to
                                    which no Answer was returned. The Man turned a deaf hear to her Expostulations, and seemed
                                    determined to maintain a sullen Silence. In the mean time Sir Charles, surveying the rest of
                                    them, remarked another Man whose Air of Cheerfulness promised better Success. The proper
                                    Inquiries were therefore addressed to him, and from his Replies it was understood, that his
                                    disconsolate Companion had been a Cabocero, or Chief of a Village, in his own Country, possessed of
                                    a great many Slaves; <said rend="quotes">and I myself,</said> continued he <said rend="quotes">was one of the Number, and used to wait
                                    upon him every Day.</said> When this Explanation was conveyed to Sir Charles, he was sensibly
                                    touched with the Vicissitude of Fortune which had reduced the Chief from the State of such Elevation <!-- omg!!!! do the authors not see the insanity of this???? -->
                                    and Authority in his own Country, to be the Companion in Servitude of his own Slave. He
                                    immediately withdrew, sent for the Cabocero to his House, and having by means of a trusty Interpreter
                                    received a Confirmation of the Story from his own Mouth, he executed a Manumission, the

                                    or remain where he was, he would freely confess, there was among his Companions a young
                                    Negress, whom he wished to have for his Wife, if she could but consent, he should prefer
                                    staying in Jamaica, and ending his Days with her. Sir Charles consulted the Girl, she made no
                                    Objection; a Spot was assigned for their Habitation upon a Part of his Estate; here they lived
                                    together very comfortably for many Years, in the Course of which their Felicity was heightened by
                                    the Birth of several Children. Sir Charles's Bounty did not terminate with his Life; for in his last
                                    Will he bequeathed Freedom to the Wife and Children. Nor was the former Liberality ill bestowed;
                                    for the poor Fellow conceived an inviolable Attachment to the Person and Interest of his Friend, and 
                                    was of very great Service in the Rebellion of Negroes which happened in 1760, when by his Influence
                                    over those belonging to Sir Charles's Plantation, most of whome were Coromantees, he 
                                    effectually restrained them from joining with their mutinous Countrymen.

                                <p>Whoever imagines that Europeans are capable of  enduring Field Labour in the West-Indies,
                                    ought to recollect what his own Feelings were, when the Thermometer during the Summer Season
                                    has risen in England to 80° in the Shade. He would figure to himself a successive Continuance
                                    of it, and then decide on the Humanity of forcing Englishmen to dig the Earth in any Part of
                                    the Globe where that is the meste Degree of shaded Heat throughout the Year; and where the
                                    Heat in the open Field is often from 15 to 32 Degrees higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>The mesne Heat on the Coast of Jamaica is 80°; and on the Coast of Africa is about 80° to 82°.</p>
                                <p>In this Temperature, which is congenial and pleasant to the Negroes, an Englishman cannot
                                    labour in the Field without imminent Danger to his Life. But on the other Hand, it is of that
                                    Kind in which the Negroes are found capable of undergoing great bodily Exertions without
                                    impairing their Health or diminishing their Enjoyments.—Africa, the <distinct rend="italic">natale Solum</distinct> of the
                                    Blacks, is notorious for being the Grave of almost every European who ventures thither to make
                                    any Stay.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the Isle of St. Thomas the Blacks do not appear to suffer from the Climate; yet so fatal is
                                    it to the White Inhabitans, that Portugal is obliged to replace them every Two Years.
                                </p>
                                <p>Doctor Chalmers informs us, that in South Carolina, in the Year 1752, during the Months
                                    of June and July, the Weather was hotter than ever had been remembered there.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Thermometer stood in the Shade at 115°, and the Heat out of the Doors was too great
                                    for his Instrument to measure; het his <emph>Negroes</emph> assured him, <quote rend="quotes"><emph>they</emph> preferred that Sort of Weather
                                    to the Winter's Cold <seg xml:id="a07ish" corresp="#n07ish">(a)</seg>.</quote></p>
                                <p>It seems as if the Sensation of Ease, and the corporeal Exertions of an European, terminated
                                    at nearly the same point where those of the African begin. Nature probably has ordained this
                                    Disparity, and appointed the Limits to each. The Negro, who Toils in the West Indies under
                                    80°, or even 96° of Heat, is in his natural Element. But an European labouring in the same
                                    Manner, under the same Exposure, would infallibly be seixed with a Fever of the most violent
                                    and dangerous Species. It is true, we cannot adduce an Example directly in point, because it
                                    has not been usual for Europeans to be employed in that Manner; but there are Examples in
                                    abundance to be met with in those Drudgeries to which that hardy Race of Men, our common
                                    Seamen, <emph>have</emph> often been compelled to submit in those Climates, and whic hare so applicable by
                                    Analogy to the ordinary Labours in our Sugar islands, as to establish the Proof of this Inaptitude
                                    most convincingly.

                                <p>In the Year 1733, when Government had resolved that a Fort and Storehouses should be
                                    erected upon Lynch's (or Navy) Island, at Port Antonio in Jamaica (which at that Period was
                                    almost entirely Woodland), the Engineers, Colonel Lilly, perceiving that Twenty Negroes, who
                                    were then employed in clearing it, did not make that Progress in the Work which his Majesty's 
                                    Service required, prevailed upon Governor Hunger and Rear Admiral Stuart to consent that a
                                    large Detachment of Seamen, drawn from the Squadron on that Station, might be employed for
                                    that Purpose. Dr. Linde has recorded the Consequences of this Measure. There are (says this
                                    experienced Practitioner) some Services of such a Nature that they cannot well be performed
                                    in hot and unhealthy Countries by Europeans, without imminent Danger of their Health and
                                    Lives. The first is that of cutting down Woods, or clearing the Ground from the Trees, the

                                    Antonio in clearing Navy Island of Wood, the Men, while in the Acto of cutting it down, were
                                    seized with a Fever and Delirium, The Phrenzy attacked a Man so suddenly, and with so much
                                    Fury, that with his Hatchet, if not prevented, he would have cut in Pieces the Persons who
                                    stood near him; and those who were seized in this Manner, and were left ot remain on Shore,
                                    either died or suffered a dangerous Fit of Sickness. He gives several other Examples, and
                                    among the rest the following:
                                </p>
                                <p>At the Conclusion of the late Peace (1762), the Captain of a Ship of War went ashore at
                                    the Island of <placeName rend="italic">Dominica</placeName>, with Twelve of his Men, to cut down the Wood, and clear a Piece of
                                    Ground, which he intended to have purchased; but in a few Days Sickness obliged them to 
                                    desist from this dangerous Work; the <emph>Captain himself</emph>, and <emph>Eleven</emph> out of his <emph>Twelve</emph> Assistants,
                                    being seized with violent Fevers, of which <emph>several died</emph>. This is an Occupation (says the humane
                                    Author) <emph>which has always proved destructive to Europeans in those Climates</emph>, and in which they
                                    ought never to be employed, especially in the rainy Season (<emph>which is the Season for planting)</emph>,
                                    there being numberless Instances of <emph>White Persons</emph>, when cutting down the Woods at that
                                    Season, who have been <emph>taken ill in the Morning</emph>, and died at Night. He adds, that if the
                                    purchasing of Negroes on the Coast of Guinea can be justified, it must be from the <emph>absolute
                                    Necessity</emph> there is for employing them instead of White Persons in such Services as these. Colonel
                                    Lily himself acknowledges (in his Letter to the Board of Ordnance, dated ad January 1734),
                                    that not only great Numbers of the common People, but <emph>above Twenty-two Officers</emph>, naval and 
                                    military perished by the Experiment at Navy Island; so that it may almost amount to a Question,
                                    Whether the selling of each Tree did not cost the Life of an English Subject? But it is hardly
                                    a Doubt, but that the same Climate and the same Labours were as malignant to the Bodies
                                    and Constitutions of Englishmen Two hundred Years ago as they are at present. Plantations
                                    have been settled in the West Indies by the Subjects of Spain, France, Britain, Holland, and
                                    other Nations; but we have no one Evidence, either historical, traditional, or inductive, to 
                                    ascertain as a Fact, that at any Period of Time, from the First Discovery by Columbus, a signel
                                    Acre of Ground in that Part of the World has ever been laboured and planted with Sugar
                                    Cane by the Hands of White Men. The Notion, therefore, that Barbadoes, or any other West
                                    India Island, was <emph>first</emph> planted by <emph>White Persons</emph>, without the Aid of Negroes, or of Indians, is
                                    absolutely and entirely unfounded.

                                <p>Of the different Vegetables in use among the Negroes, the Plantain is their chief Favourite, 
                                    for its heartening and invigorating Properties. It seems to be indebted for this Distinction 
                                    to a Degree of <distinct rend="italic">Astringency</distinct> which it possesses, and which their other Vegetables have not.
                                    Whether therefore the Plantation Trees happen to be blown down, the Negroes are speedily
                                    affected by the Change of Diet, and become subject to Fluxes. The Bread Fruit is said to 
                                    resemble the Plantiant in that distinguishing Quality, and is probably, for thsi Reason, not less
                                    nutritious and proper, and would be a most valuable Substitute.

                                <p>The French Colonists are not allowed to cultivate the Plantain, perhaps lest they might be
                                    tempted to rely too much upon so precarious a Resource in calamitous Years, and neglect the
                                    raising of Ground Provisions.

                                <head>Mr. Ashley, concerning the Use of the Plough on his Estate in Jamaica.</head>
                                <p>In addition to what has been before stated as Information received from some of the Agents
                                    for the British Islands in the West Indies, and in the Returns made from the said Islands, to
                                    the Question concerning the Use of the Plough in the Cultivation of Sugar Plantations in the
                                    said Islands, the Committee examined John Ashley, Esq. (now of Cookham) who had been recommended 
                                    as a Person who had himself made Experiment of the Use of the Plough upon his
                                    Estate in Jamaica; and his Evidence is as follows:
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley was born in Jamaica, and inherited an Estate there, which himself converted into
                                    a Sugar Plantation. He made little use of the Plough until the latter Part of the Year 1783.
                                    till which Time his Plantation never yielded more that 115 Tierces of Sugar. From the great
                                    Drought which they experienced in Jamaica in the Year 1782, the Crops were very small in the Years
                                     1783 and 1784; and Mr. Ashley finding himself much incumbered, and fearing to run further in
                                     Debt for the Purchase of Negroes, he determined to make a more extensive Experiment of the
                                     Use of the Plough, and made the Experiment accordingly from November 1783 to May
                                     1784. He opened fresh Land to enlarge his Plantation, and did it with the Plough; and the
                                     Consequence was, that with the same Strenght of Negroes, without the Addition of One, he made
                                     about 235 Tierces of Sugar, double the Quantity he had made before—but Mr. Ashley desired
                                     leave to observe, that they Year 1785 was a remarkably fine yielding Year. The Number of his
                                     Negroes (including his Children and infirm Negroes) was all this Time Ninety-six; of that Number
                                     he had Forty on his Field List, but seldom worked about Thirty-two at a Time.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley left the Island in June 1785, and wished the Use of the Plough to be continued
                                    on his Plantation, but finds it had not been done—his Overseer always makes Excuses,
                                    and says, it will interfere with the Use of the Cattle, which are wanted for Crop Time; but Mr.
                                    Ashley differs with him, as the Land may be ploughed in the latter Part of the Year before
                                    Crop Time begins. Mr. Ashley is of opinion that Overseers have a Prejudice against the Use
                                    of the Plough, from Dislike to be driven out of their ancient Mode of Cultivation. Some few 
                                    of the Overseers purchase Negroes to let out to hire, and where that is they Case, it may be their
                                    Interest not to abridge the Labour of Slaves.

                                <p>Mr. Asley being asked, Whether the Soil is not sometimes so dry as not to admit the Use of
                                    the Plough? replied, He never found it so—that he ploughed  in the Time of the greatest
                                    Drought—that his Plantation was situated in a very flat Country, subject to great Droughts, which
                                    make their Crops very precarious.
                                </p>
                                <p>Being asked, Whether the Ground is not sometimes too hilly or too stony for the Plough?
                                    he said, That in some Parts of the Island the Ground certainly is too hilly; but he has been
                                    told that the Farmer in this Country sometimes ploughs in the ground as steep as can well be 
                                    conceived. Mr. Ashley cannot say but there may be Parts of Jamaica too stony for the Plough.
                                </p>
                                <p>Being aksed, If the very steep Ground is ever used as a Sugar Plantation, he said a great deal
                                    of very steep Ground is used for Sugar Plantations, and the surest Grops are on those Grounds, as
                                    they experience a more regular Succession of Seasons, from their Situation in the interior Part of
                                    the Island.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley being asked, Whether the Cattle in so hot a Climate bear the Labour well? replied,
                                    They certainly do bear it well, and added that his Cattle were in as good Order when he
                                    left off ploughing as when he began, for he always plought from Day-light to Nine o'Clock
                                    in the Morning, and in the Evening from Three o'Clock till Dark, by which means the Cattle
                                    and the Ploughmen rested during the Heat of the Day.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley was aksed, what he conceived would be the Difference of Expence between 
                                    ploughing and holing and Acre for Canes? and replied, an Acre will employ Forty Negroes,
                                    on an Average of Soil a Day, to dig it fit for planting Canes; and a Jobber was paid in his
                                    Time 7l. Currency (equal to 5l. Sterling) for doing it. Mr. Ashley broke up an Acre in a
                                    Day, working only at the Periods above-mentioned with Two Sets of Oxen, each Set consisting 
                                    of Eight Oxen (One for the Morning and One for the Evening) to One Plough; and it took
                                    him Half a Day more to put it in the same Order for planting the Canes, as the Land dug by
                                    Jobbers. But without the previous Operation of breaking up the Land (which Labour in many
                                    Souls may be spared) he has holed Two Acres a Day with Two Spells of Oxen to the Plough,
                                    and has found it answer full as well as Land holed by Negro Labour. The Land holed by
                                    Hand is never entirely broken up, there being an intermediate Space of Land which as not
                                    been dug, upon which they pull up the Earth out of the Holes.
                                </p>
                                
                                <pb/>
                                
                                <p>Mr. Ashley is of opinion, founded upon Experience, that Land holed by the Plough is more
                                    likely to produce good Crops, than Land hoed by the Labour of Negroes, because the Ground 
                                    is more completely shaken by the Plough than by the Hoe. He cannot say at what Rate per Acre
                                    a Jobber would undertake to plough, as he never new an Acre ploughed by Job.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley, though he generally ploughed with Oxen, sometimes put Two Horses as Leaders in
                                    the room of Two Oxen, and found them stand the labour as well as the oxen. Mules well
                                    trained would stand the Labour better than either.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley being asked whether his Estate produced as much since the Use of the Plough
                                    was discontinued as before when it was used? replied, It had not; but that might be owing to
                                    various Circumstances. He rather imputes the falling off to the Want of Rains, for although
                                    the Plough has not been made use of, there as been no Want of Labour, as he has purchased
                                    more Negroes, and has hired Jobbers occasionally, but his Expences therefore have been higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley observed that he wished here to explain that in part of the Island where his
                                    Estate is situated, the Labour is not so great as in many other Places, as the Canes will bear a
                                    Repetition of cutting for Eight or Ten Years, wihout re-holing or replanting the Land;
                                    whereas in some Estates situate in other Parts of the Island, One-third of the Sugar Land must
                                    be replanted every Year, not bearing to be cut above Twice, that is Once in Plant and Once in
                                    Rattoon. On these Estates, therefore, the Plough would be much more useful, than in that
                                    Part of the Island where his Property lies, provided they are not hilly Plantations. And Mr.
                                    Ahsley is of opinion that the Stock employed in Grinding the Sugar Cane might be employed 
                                    as soon as the Crops are over, until they begin again (say Six Months Space at least) in ploughing
                                    the Land without the Addition of Stock upon the Plantation or Tetriment to them.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley added, that he found the Negroes lear the Use of the Plough very readily,
                                    though at first the Negro set to Plough seemed to thinki t an Harship on him, to do the Labour
                                    (as he termed it) of all the Field Negroes. But as it was necessary to have One Negro to drive
                                    the Oxen in the Plough, Mr. Ashley took care to have thim trained to hodling the Plough; so
                                    that in fact there were Two Ploughmen to One Plough; when the one was ploughing the other
                                    drove, and by changing their Situations relieved each other, so as to make the Labour light.
                                </p>
                                <p>Mr. Ashley being asked, Whether he could state to the Committee the Quantity of Sugar is 
                                    Estate produced each Year? replied, that could be recollect the exact Quantity he had made
                                    each Year, and the Number of Slaves he possessed at each Period of Time from his first settling,
                                    it would be no manner of Use; for as he had already mentioned, the Seasons are so very
                                    precarious in the Part of the Island where his Estate is situated, that some Years they do not make 
                                    sufficient to pay the contingent Charges, and in others the Returns are ample.
