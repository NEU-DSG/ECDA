            <p>At the close of a sultry day in the month of
            October, in the year one thousand eight hundred 
            and twenty-two; or rather at the moment when 
            the sun (whose fiery ardour had not been moderated
            in any part of his course by the least zephyr
            of the sea breeze) had just sunk behind the emerald
            summits of the Blue Mountain, and relieved 
            from his scorching rays those Europeans who
            toil on the northern shores of Jamaica; a person
            who (from some circumstances about to be explained)
            appeared to be a stranger, was seen
            riding along the western bank of the Rio Grande,
            that clear and beautiful stream which hurrying

            down from the wildernesses of the island, carries
            the torrents of its highest mountains to the
            Atlantic. The stranger seemed to be seeking a 
            ford, and strove from time to time to prevail on 
            a sulky-looking Spanish horse, which bore him
            without manifesting any satisfaction at his burthen, 
            to venture through the deep and rapid 
            current; but it was evident that the rider and his 
            steed were of two minds on the point, and that
            the pertinacity of the latter was more than a match
            for the hesitating and undecided anxiety of the 
            former; whose timidity, arising from inexperience
            of the river, induced him not to press his beast
            into the flood against that instinct to which he
            preferred to trust his fortune on the present
            occasion.</p>
      
            <p>The rider was accoutred in a black coat, cut
            straight, or it might be of a dingy grey, with
            black cloth buttons, and a waistcoat of the same.
            His trowsers were of brown holland, tucked into 
            a huge pair of spatterdashes, buttoned above his
            knee, as a defence against the bites of musquitos.
            He wore a large brimmed hat, slouched by
            many a tropical shower, and rendered rusty by
            constant exposure to the tropical sun, although
            at present he carried an umbrella secured in the 
            straps of a portmanteau mounted behind him on
            his horse's crupper; and his great-coat, of the 
            same sombre hue as his other vestments, was fast-
            <pb/>
            
            HAMEL <fw type="pageNum">3</fw>
            ended upon his saddle bow. He was attended by a 
            bare-legged negro boy on foot, dressed in an Osnaburgh
            frock and drawers, which, with a glazed hat
            on his head, formed the whole of his costume.
            The boy hung on sometimes to his master's stirrup, 
            that he might keep pace with the horse; and 
            sometimes, falling into the rear, brought himself
            up by grasping the animal's long tail; a liberty
            the beast admitted with an occasional affectation
            of elevating his croupe and lowering his ears, - 
            intimations that he had a right to kick (though
            he did not at present) as well understood by
            young Cuffy as expressed by the horse.</p>
            
            <p>This youngster's features scarcely harmonized 
            with those of his very demure and melancholy looking
            master, whose pale and cadaverous countenance 
            indicated something more than bodily 
            mortification and fatigue. His eyes, black and
            penetrating, were shadowed by brows that had 
            once been dark as the skin of his follower, but
            now, with the locks that strayed in right lines
            from under his huge castor, exhibited the mingled 
            hues of black and grey; his nose was sharp and 
            aquiline; and his mouth, though rather of the 
            largest, by no means badly formed, was furnished 
            with a set of short but regular teeth, as white as
            those of Cuffy, whose happy physiognomy bespoke
            the innocence and kindness of his heart,
            and relieved that of the spectator from the sym-

            pathy of sadness inspired by the looks of the 
            white-faced traveller. Yet the gloom on the 
            cheek of this last was not attributable perhaps to 
            any dignified grief or sentimentality of disposition
            -at least his features did not augur any such 
            feeling; nor to age, for he was by some years
            short of forty. Anxiety of mind, as well as fatigue
            of body, natural irritability, and pecuniary cares,
            will impress even on a more juvenile countenance
            those lines which, visible there only, are channelled 
            by time and memory on the invisible and wasted
            heart. Whether this were the case in the present
            instance, will be seen in the course of our narrative.</p>
            
            <p>The stranger and his footman continued their
            route for some distance beside the river, halting
            again and again to compare notes as to the fordability
            of several spots, where the latter declared
            he could see the track of mules and horses,
            which he thought had crossed from the other
            side; but his master imagined them to be only
            indications of the cattle having been there to 
            drink or cool themselves, and referred the point 
            invariably to his horse, who, however anxious to
            drink or roll in the stream, always manifested the 
            same unwillingness to traverse it. The evening
            was closing in rapidly, and the traveller, impatient 
            at last of his beast's fears or obstinacy, had
            directed his valet to strip and try a ford, which,
            <pb/>
            
            HAMEL.<fw type="pageNum">5</fw>
            
            as he could distinguish by marks on the opposite
            side, was certainly used at times; when
            Cuffy who was already half across the river, 
            called to his master that he could see some 
            Negroes coming down the hills from the interior
            towards a row of stones or rocks placed a little 
            farther up the winding current, for the convenience 
            of foot passengers, which had been hidden
            from their view by the trees growing on its banks.</p>
            
            <p>To this rudest of rude bridges the traveller 
            and his boy advanced without delay, being anxious
            no doubt to leave the river behind them,
            and hurry to their quarters, yet at some miles 
            distance beyond it, if possible before nightfall; 
            and they had just gained the bridge in question, 
            when they were saluted by the Negroes, who 
            were coming down from their provision grounds 
            with yams, cocos, and various fruits for the 
            next day's market on their heads. There was an 
            excellent ford just above the stepping stones, 
            which the cantancrous horse was compelled to 
            pass, Cuffy still leading the way; and the Negroes 
            furnished them with abundant directions to the 
            settlement for which the traveller inquired, though
            accompanied with a piece of intelligence not 
            altogether so welcome, as they intimated a report 
            that the said settlement had been deserted since 
            the death of its proprietor, whose widow had 
            gone down to Port Antonio, while his slaves,
            
            <fw type="pageNum">6</fw> HAMEL.
            
            some eighteen or twenty, had run away into the 
            woods.</p>
            
            <p>Notwithstanding this information, the traveller's 
            countenance brightened very visibly at sight
            of some young negro girls of the party, to each 
            of whom he had something agreeable to say - some
            compliment to their persons, attended with a 
            cavalier and rather equivocal expression of his 
            eyes, which raised a smile on the lips of the 
            sable beauties, and elicited some rather diverting 
            remarks from them on the discrepancy between 
            his language and his looks. One of them, who 
            said she was handmaid to her mistress, observed 
            that he smelt sweet like her lady's washball; and 
            most of them remarked on the perfumed state of 
            his person, to which it must be avowed he was not 
            inattentive: and whether they were cosmetics, or 
            preparations for the hair, or essences to gratify 
            his own olfactory nerves, which he breathed, he 
            was, in fact, "perfumed like a milliner."</p>
            
            <p>Yet in the midst of these odours he asked the 
            young girls whether they were married; and if 
            married, whether the ceremony had been performed 
            by a priest or a missionary, or whether 
            they were married after the African fashion. He
            enquired too about their soul's grace, their work, 
            profits, punishments: - whether they expected to 
            be free, and how many Mulatto and Quadroon 
            girls there were on their master's estate, and if 
            <pb/>

            his daughter were handsome; and then relapsed 
            into some rather spiritual advice, mingled with a 
            few allusions to the worm which dieth not, and 
            the fire which is not quenched.</p>
            
            <p>The girls began to think him an unaccountable 
            buckra, and rather affected with insanity; more 
            especially as he persisted in his intention of proceeding 
            to the settlement of which they had given 
            him such an unfavourable account, and refused 
            their assurance, on the part of their master or the 
            overseer, of good quarters and hospitable entertainment 
            for the night. Cuffy would fain have 
            seconded their arguments, but his master silenced 
            him with a gloomy frown; and after a few more 
            desultory observations to the women, with some 
            of whom he chose to shake hands, the head of 
            the Spanish steed was turned toward the mountains; 
            and Cuffy again seizing its tail, master and 
            man resumed their course. The short twilight 
            expired, and the shadows of night rendered still 
            more sombre the forlorn and unfrequented path 
            along which they journeyed.</p>

            <p>he had left, and lingered onwards most reluctantly, 
            in spite of sundry kicks bestowed on his 
            ribs by his fractious master, whose impatience 
            increased with the storm which already penetrated 
            through his garments. A tropical wetting is but 
            too often precursor and cause of those baleful 
            fevers which are almost the only curse upon the 
            otherwise blissful climate of the Antilles, - blissful 
            in the idea of the inhabitants; and our traveller, 
            already initiated in the miseries of this scourge, 
            was but too full of apprehensions and forebodings, 
            as he felt the tempest invade him to the skin.</p>
            
            <p>The thoughts of a sick bed, or sickness without 
            a bed, without medicine, in an abandoned 
            dwelling in the midst of the jungle, as it was 
            represented to him, crowded fast on his perturbed 
            imagination, which now first reproached him for 
            the expedition he had undertaken, although the 
            feeling was purely selfish: however, it was of short 
            duration; the uproar of the elements increased 
            so rapidly and violently, that all apprehensions 
            for the past or the future quickly yielded to more 
            immediate fears for his present personal safety. 
            They had been for some time ascending, and had 
            now gained the summit of a steep hill, whence 
            the road began to descend as abruptly into another 
            dingle, through which they could discover, by the 
            occasional flashes of lightning, a river of more 
            importance than the many petty streams they 
            <pb/>
            
            HAMEL. <fw type="pageNum">11</fw>
            
            had already crossed. This was indeed the Rio 
            Grande again, but little inferior in magnitude to 
            the volume of water it had presented to them 
            some miles below; and how were they to pass it? 
            or how indeed were they to reach it? The road, 
            scarcely three feet wide, wound along the side of a 
            precipice, against which the wind raged with such 
            fury, and the rain beat so spitefully, that the horse 
            for a long time refused to face either of them, and 
            was at last driven down into the valley by master 
            and man on foot, urging him with sticks, and 
            preventing him from turning round in the narrow 
            path, so slippery and precipitous that he slid 
            down the last portion of it on his hind quarters, 
            and rolled over and over into the narrow plain 
            below, bursting his girths and scattering abroad 
            his harness and the portmanteau, umbrella, and 
            great coat. These were, however, readjusted 
            with a promptitude inspired by the occasion, and 
            with a resolution which was little else than the 
            effect of despair; the river was passed in comparative 
            safety; Cuffy, who led the horse, only 
            stumbling occasionally over the loose rocks which 
            strewed its channel. But scarcely had they 
            reached the terra firma on the other side, when 
            the terrified boy cried out that the earth shook 
            beneath him, and ran up the path which they had 
            found, as if he expected the river to rise and 
            arrest him, or hurry him with its waters down its 
            <pb/>
            
            <fw type="pageNum">12</fw> HAMEL.
            
            impetuous current. The horse, no less alarmed, 
            or afraid of losing his negro guide and friend, 
            hastened after him. Another eminence was gained, 
            from whence a track of fire was driving apparently at a 
            great distance before the wind. "Earthquakes 
            are not uncommon," thought the traveller; "but 
            fire - this must be produced by human means." 
            Cuffy thought otherwise; more especially when 
            he descried other fires in different directions, and 
            one or two now and then flashing into view at no 
            very great apparent distance. The earth shook 
            again; and the wind, as if it had still reserved 
            some of its power for an effort of desperation, 
            burst on them with such exasperated fury, that 
            it seemed impossible to make farther progress 
            against it. Cuffy clung to the boughs and the 
            rocks beside him; and his master being fain to 
            follow his example, the steed, with equipage, 
            was left to the mercy of the elements, from 
            which they saw him gradually recede to the 
            distance of fifty or sixty yards, like a ship 
            driving at her anchors and going bodily to leeward, 
            until he was lost in the darkness. Cuffy, 
            true to his trust, abandoned his hold to keep 
            sight of his master's baggage; while his master, 
            encumbered with his spatterdashes, and fearful of 
            following the fate of his Bucephalus, encouraged 
            his valet to stand by the horse, and took a firmer
            <pb/>
            
            HAMEL. <fw type="pageNum">13</fw>
            
            grasp of the rocks from which he sought protecion. 
            Often and often was his voice lost in the 
            tumult of the storm, as he shouted to his boy for 
            some assurance of his safety. No answer reached 
            his ears - no sound but that of the elements 
            raging as if to produce a second chaos, thunder 
            and wind, the roaring of the augmented waterfalls, 
            the rumbling of the rocks which they loosed 
            from their beds, the creaking and crashing of 
            falling trees. It was in vain that the lightning at 
            every other instant illuminated the scene with its 
            partial flashes, now here, now there: it gleamed 
            only on mountains uncultivated and uninhabited, 
            (except perhaps by a few outlawed runaways who 
            lived by a predatory warfare on the wild hogs and 
            pigeons of the desart,) on naked precipices and 
            foaming torrents, or on the giant trees of the forest 
            quivering beneath the blast of the hurricane. Then 
            came down the rain, not as in the temperate zone 
            even in its most weeping seasons, when the spectator 
            would fain imagine a second deluge; but 
            torrents, sheets of water, seemed to rush from the 
            clouds, and threaten the annihilation of all life 
            beneath the sky. The forlorn and dispirited traveller, 
            still clinging to the rocks which yielded 
            him a partial and precarious kind of security, had 
            groped his way along them to a chink, in whose 
            recesses he flattered himself with an idea of 
            weathering the storm till daylight, drenched -

            nay, almost drowned - as he was by this time; but 
            even here the elementary war pursued him; a 
            stream of water began to ripple down the chink, 
            soon swelling to a torrent, augmented by another 
            which found its way through the chasms of the 
            precipice as if it had burst from some subterranean 
            reservoir. The traveller's situation became 
            insupportable; he must remove or perish; yet 
            not daring to quit the crags to which he clung, 
            and availing himself of the partial lee they afforded, 
            he essayed to clamber up the face of the precipice, 
            and with much difficulty and struggling 
            reached the edge of the chink whence the torrent 
            fell. Here he found himself comparatively safe in 
            a long narrow passage or natural alley, in which 
            he was at least secured from the wind by the 
            high and inaccessible rocks on either side of it. 
            Yet as the torrent still flowed over his feet and half 
            way up his legs, he waded onwards to find a spot 
            of higher ground, or an insulated piece of rock 
            that might elevate him above the stream, and 
            with this hope pursued the course of it for above 
            a hundred yards, till he came to a chasm that 
            opened on it from another mass of rocks, between 
            which and his present station another brawling 
            cataract, at depth of fifty feet beneath him, 
            found its way towards the streams which united 
            in the Rio Grande below. A fallen tree formed a 
            bridge across this fissure, on the opposite side of 
            
               <pb/>

            which the mouth of a cave might be distinguished 
            by a glare of the lightning, sufficient in appearance 
            to ensure our traveller shelter and safety for 
            the night - shelter from the rain, and security from 
            the wind. It was a most perilous undertaking to 
            pass this bridge; but prompted by hope, and urged 
            by misery and fear, he ventured on its uncertain 
            surface, keeping his balance by means of a branch 
            that hung from the opposite side, which, with 
            much ado, he reached at last without accident. 
            Here he found what appeared to him steps cut by 
            human art for some height in the face of the rock: 
            he ascended them, and walked into the cave.</p>

            <p>As soon as the traveller found himself safe from 
            the storm, he sat down on the floor of the cave, 
            and burst into a flood of tears; and something like 
            an acknowledgment of heaven's mercy passed 
            his lips. His next thought was for his boy and 
            his equipage, the horse and the portmanteau; 
            nor was he long in adverting to the deplorable 
            condition in which he yet found himself, drenched 
            with rain, and exhausted with the fatigue of having 
            borne up against the passion of the hurricane. 
            To sit still might be fatal to him in this state, and 
            he had even thoughts of stripping off his wet garments, 
            and parading the cave, as far as he could 
            see into it, till daylight; but was checked by the 
            idea which he could not dismiss of stepping on 
            scorpions or centipedes, or becoming an easier 
            prey to the musquitos which like himself had 
            here found a refuge from the weather. While he

            yet mused on the manner in which he was to pass 
            the hours till morning, his olfactory nerves became 
            sensible of a smell of fire, - the smoke of burning 
            wood, which evidently came from the interior of 
            the cave; and hastily concluding it to be owing to 
            one of the wandering fires he had seen abroad, he 
            explored his way through the cavern towards the 
            smell, expecting to find an outlet on the other 
            side of the mountain, through which he calculated 
            the smoke was driven perhaps from a distance. 
            The odour and its vapour increased as he proceeded; 
            and he had not made a very long or very painful 
            march, before he began to perceive a glimmering 
            of light, by which he attained an inner apartment 
            as it were of a cave, filled it is true with smoke, 
            but in some measure illuminated by the fire from 
            which it exhaled; not one of the wandering fires 
            of the wilderness, but a fire of burning brands laid 
            on the floor of the apartment too evidently by 
            human hands. "This," thought he, "is at least the 
            abode of man: runaway slave, Maroon, or robber, 
            I will yet claim his hospitality; my situation 
            cannot be worse, and what have I to lose? 
            But where is the tenant of the dwelling? Here 
            are plantains too, not long roasted, and rum; and 
            what are these?" he added, taking up some garments 
            that lay on the floor, a contoo, and an 
            instrument of music, a bonjaw. "Let us at least 
            summon the master of the cave. What ho! hilloh!"

            The voice died away unheeded, and the traveller 
            listened to its echoes until he felt almost afraid 
            and ashamed to disturb the silence again. Yet 
            he mustered courage to exert his voice a second 
            and a third time, though as at first ineffectually. 
            Sufficiently removed from the storm without, to 
            hear no more of it than an occasional murmur 
            which stole along the vault he had penetrated, 
            too faint to cause him any farther concern, his 
            own voice was reverberated on his ears with a
            force from which he shrank within himself, so 
            painful was it to his oppressed and agitated 
            nerves. He called no more; but conforming himself 
            with a philosophical moderation to the hour 
            and the scene in which he found himself, he trimmed 
            the fire; took off his wet clothes, which he 
            wrung and disposed around it; attired himself in 
            the contoo of his invisible host; and wrapping his 
            feet in a blanket which lay beside it, helped himself
            from the calabash of rum, and put some of the 
            plantains on the fire again to warm. He had 
            seated himself on a bundle of sticks, and as he 
            took a second taste of the rum calabash, surveyed 
            at his leisure, by the cheerful blaze he had made, 
            the extent and furniture of his apartment.</p>
            
            <p>It was a lofty cavern hewn by the hand of nature 
            in the otherwise solid lime-stone rock, from 
            the roof of which hung many stalactites, whose 
            points were blackened by the smoke from the fire

            beneath. Besides the opening by which the traveller 
            had entered, there were four other apertures, 
            each leading, as it seemed from the glimpse 
            he had taken of them, to the other recesses in the 
            rock, and so much resembling each other that he 
            could not now distinctly ascertain that which had 
            admitted him. Alarmed for a moment as this discovery, 
            he arose from his seat, and taking a firebrand 
            from the blazing pile, would fain have explored 
            these vomitories, into each of which he 
            walked a few paces, without however deriving the 
            information he required, or gaining any but a conviction 
            that they extended farther than he was 
            disposed at present to penetrate. He next surveyed 
            the precincts of the cave itself, and its rather 
            curious contents. In a recess stood a couple of 
            spears, one solely of hard wood, whose point was 
            rendered still harder by fire; the other was shod 
            with iron and rusted apparently with blood; a 
            bamboo rod, ten feet in length and about an inch 
            in thickness, leaned against the rock beside them, 
            carved or tattoed from end to end. In another 
            angle of the vault was a calabash filled with various 
            sorts of hair, among which it was easy to discriminate 
            that of white men, horses, and dogs. 
            These were huddled together, and crowded with 
            feathers of various birds, especially those of 
            domestic poultry and wild parrots, with one or 
            two of the spoils of a macaw. A human skull

            was placed beside this calabash, from which the 
            teeth were missing; but on turning it up, the traveller 
            found them with a quantity of broken glass 
            crammed into the cerebellum, and covered up with 
            a wad of silk cotton, to prevent them from falling 
            out. There were several other skulls in a second 
            recess, some perfect, some which had been broken 
            apparently with a sharp pointed instrument, and 
            many of them serving as calabashes or boxes to 
            hold the strange property of the master of the 
            cave; one was a receptacle for gunpowder, which 
            the inquisitive traveller narrowly escaped inflaming; 
            a second contained bullets and shot of various 
            sizes, mixed with old nails and pieces of rag; 
            and from a third he saw with no little horror a 
            black snake uncoil itself the moment he touched 
            it. There were three muskets, all old and out of 
            order; a pistol and two cutlasses, disposed on different 
            ledges of the rock; a large conch-shell 
            fitted with a belt of mahoe bark, to be worn over 
            the shoulder, hung from a projection, with several 
            other pieces of rope made of similar materials, to 
            which were attached rings of wood and hollowed 
            stones, perhaps intended for amulets or charms. 
            A lamp of clay at last arrested his attention; it 
            had carved on it some rude figures and was filled 
            with oil of the Palma Christi, having a wick 
            formed of the fibres of the plantain stalk. This 
            the intruder took the liberty of illuming, to assist 
            
            <pb/>

            him more conveniently than did his flickering 
            firebrand in the farther search he seemed disposed 
            to prosecute. By the help of this he espied a 
            pair of shoepatters, a sort of coarse sandal, and a 
            red cloak resembling the South-American poncho. 
            Some salted fish was suspended from a part of the 
            roof, with a large calabash of sugar, and another of 
            coarse salt; and an earthen jar contained no 
            small store of salted pork. There were several 
            pieces of jerked hog hanging from a stick 
            placed across this recess, to one of which he 
            helped himself without ceremony; and thinking 
            he had made sufficient search for the present, 
            returned to the fire, on which he heaped fresh fuel, 
            raking forward the embers to cook his meat: 
            placed his lamp on a shelf of the rock full in his 
            view; and taking a gombah for his stool, sat down 
            very deliberately to his supper. He ate with no 
            sparing appetite; and the rum which he quaffed 
            as his thirst prompted him, refreshed his body 
            and composed his mind so happily and so gradually, 
            that what with that and his fatigue, the 
            solace of the fire and the fumes of his digestion, 
            he at last slipt gently from his gombah, which 
            now served him for a pillow, rolled himself up in 
            his blanket, and fell into a profound sleep.</p>
