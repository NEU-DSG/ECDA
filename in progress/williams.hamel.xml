            <p>At the close of a sultry day in the month of
            October, in the year one thousand eight hundred 
            and twenty-two; or rather at the moment when 
            the sun (whose fiery ardour had not been moderated
            in any part of his course by the least zephyr
            of the sea breeze) had just sunk behind the emerald
            summits of <placeName ref="#blue_mountains">the Blue Mountain</placeName>, and relieved 
            from his scorching rays those <rs type="persGroup">Europeans</rs> who
            toil on the northern shores of <placeName ref="#jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>; <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">a person</rs>
            who (from some circumstances about to be explained)
            appeared to be <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">a stranger</rs>, was seen
            riding along the western bank of the <placeName ref="#rio_grande">Rio Grande</placeName>,
            that clear and beautiful stream which hurrying
            
            <fw>VOL I.</fw>

            <fw type="pageNum">2</fw>
            
            down from the wildernesses of the island, carries
            the torrents of its highest mountains to the
            <placeName ref="#atlantic_ocean">Atlantic</placeName>. <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">The stranger</rs> seemed to be seeking a 
            ford, and strove from time to time to prevail on 
            a sulky-looking <ecda:fauna>Spanish horse</ecda:fauna>, which bore him
            without manifesting any satisfaction at his burthen, 
            to venture through the deep and rapid 
            current; but it was evident that <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the rider</rs> and his 
            steed were of two minds on the point, and that
            the pertinacity of the latter was more than a match
            for the hesitating and undecided anxiety of the 
            former; whose timidity, arising from inexperience
            of the river, induced him not to press his beast
            into the flood against that instinct to which he
            preferred to trust his fortune on the present
            occasion.</p>
      
            <p><rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">The rider</rs> was accoutred in a black coat, cut
            straight, or it might be of a dingy grey, with
            black cloth buttons, and a waistcoat of the same.
            His trowsers were of brown holland, tucked into 
            a huge pair of spatterdashes, buttoned above his
            knee, as a defence against the bites of <ecda:fauna>musquitos</ecda:fauna>.
            He wore a large brimmed hat, slouched by
            many a tropical shower, and rendered rusty by
            constant exposure to the tropical sun, although
            at present he carried an umbrella secured in the 
            straps of a portmanteau mounted behind him on
            his <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>'s crupper; and his great-coat, of the 
            same sombre hue as his other vestments, was fast-
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">3</fw>
            
            ended upon his saddle bow. He was attended by a 
            bare-legged <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">negro boy</rs> on foot, dressed in an Osnaburgh
            frock and drawers, which, with a glazed hat
            on his head, formed the whole of his costume.
            <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">The boy</rs> hung on sometimes to his <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs>'s stirrup, 
            that he might keep pace with the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>; and 
            sometimes, falling into the rear, brought himself
            up by grasping the animal's long tail; a liberty
            the beast admitted with an occasional affectation
            of elevating his croupe and lowering his ears,—
            intimations that he had a right to kick (though
            he did not at present) as well understood by
            young <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> as expressed by the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>.</p>
            
            <p>This <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">youngster</rs>'s features scarcely harmonized 
            with those of his very demure and melancholy looking
            <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs>, whose pale and cadaverous countenance 
            indicated something more than bodily 
            mortification and fatigue. His eyes, black and
            penetrating, were shadowed by brows that had 
            once been dark as the skin of his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">follower</rs>, but
            now, with the locks that strayed in right lines
            from under his huge castor, exhibited the mingled 
            hues of black and grey; his nose was sharp and 
            aquiline; and his mouth, though rather of the 
            largest, by no means badly formed, was furnished 
            with a set of short but regular teeth, as white as
            those of <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName>, whose happy physiognomy bespoke
            the innocence and kindness of his heart,
            and relieved that of the spectator from the sym-
            <pb/>
            
            <fw type="pageNum">4</fw> 
            
            pathy of sadness inspired by the looks of <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the 
            white-faced traveller</rs>. Yet the gloom on the 
            cheek of this last was not attributable perhaps to 
            any dignified grief or sentimentality of disposition
            —at least his features did not augur any such 
            feeling; nor to age, for he was by some years
            short of forty. Anxiety of mind, as well as fatigue
            of body, natural irritability, and pecuniary cares,
            will impress even on a more juvenile countenance
            those lines which, visible there only, are channelled 
            by time and memory on the invisible and wasted
            heart. Whether this were the case in the present
            instance, will be seen in the course of our narrative.</p>
            
            <p><rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">The stranger</rs> and his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">footman</rs> continued their
            route for some distance beside the river, halting
            again and again to compare notes as to the fordability
            of several spots, where the latter declared
            he could see the track of <ecda:fauna>mules</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>,
            which he thought had crossed from the other
            side; but his <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs> imagined them to be only
            indications of the cattle having been there to 
            drink or cool themselves, and referred the point 
            invariably to his <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>, who, however anxious to
            drink or roll in the stream, always manifested the 
            same unwillingness to traverse it. The evening
            was closing in rapidly, and <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs>, impatient 
            at last of his beast's fears or obstinacy, had
            directed his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">valet</rs> to strip and try a ford, which,
            <pb/>
            
            <fw type="pageNum">5</fw>
            
            as he could distinguish by marks on the opposite
            side, was certainly used at times; when
            <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> who was already half across the river, 
            called to his <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs> that he could see some 
            <rs type="persGroup">Negroes</rs> coming down the hills from the interior
            towards a row of stones or rocks placed a little 
            farther up the winding current, for the convenience 
            of foot passengers, which had been hidden
            from their view by the <rs ana="flora">trees</rs> growing on its banks.</p>
            
            <p>To this rudest of rude bridges <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs> 
            and his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">boy</rs> advanced without delay, being anxious
            no doubt to leave the river behind them,
            and hurry to their quarters, yet at some miles 
            distance beyond it, if possible before nightfall; 
            and they had just gained the bridge in question, 
            when they were saluted by <rs type="persGroup">the Negroes</rs>, who 
            were coming down from their provision grounds 
            with <ecda:food>yams</ecda:food>, <ecda:food>cocos</ecda:food>, and various <ecda:food>fruits</ecda:food> for the 
            next day's market on their heads. There was an 
            excellent ford just above the stepping stones, 
            which the cantancrous <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> was compelled to 
            pass, <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> still leading the way; and <rs type="persGroup">the Negroes</rs> 
            furnished them with abundant directions to the 
            settlement for which the traveller inquired, though
            accompanied with a piece of intelligence not 
            altogether so welcome, as <said direct="false">they intimated a report 
            that the said settlement had been deserted since 
            the death of its <ecda:anonPers>proprietor</ecda:anonPers>, whose <ecda:anonPers>widow</ecda:anonPers> had 
            gone down to <placeName ref="#port_antonio">Port Antonio</placeName>, while his <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs>,
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">6</fw> 
            
            some eighteen or twenty, had run away into the 
            woods.</said></p>
            
            <p>Notwithstanding this information, <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs>'s 
            countenance brightened very visibly at sight
            of <rs type="persGroup">some young negro girls</rs> of the party, to each 
            of whom <said direct="false">he had something agreeable to say—some
            compliment to their persons</said>, attended with a 
            cavalier and rather equivocal expression of his 
            eyes, which raised a smile on the lips of <rs type="persGroup">the 
            sable beauties</rs>, and <said direct="false">elicited some rather diverting 
            remarks from them on the discrepancy between 
            his language and his looks</said>. One of them, who 
            <said direct="false">said she was handmaid to her mistress, observed 
            that he smelt sweet like her lady's washball</said>; and 
            <said direct="false">most of them remarked on the perfumed state of 
            his person</said>, to which it must be avowed he was not 
            inattentive: and whether they were cosmetics, or 
            preparations for the hair, or essences to gratify 
            his own olfactory nerves, which he breathed, he 
            was, in fact, <hi rend="quotes">perfumed like a milliner</hi>.</p>
            
            <p>Yet in the midst of these odours <said direct="false">he asked <rs type="persGroup">the 
            young girls</rs> whether they were married; and if 
            married, whether the ceremony had been performed 
            by a priest or a missionary, or whether 
            they were married after the African fashion. He
            enquired too about their soul's grace, their work, 
            profits, punishments:—whether they expected to 
            be free, and how many Mulatto and Quadroon 
            girls there were on their master's estate, and if

            his daughter were handsome; and then relapsed 
            into some rather spiritual advice, mingled with a 
            few allusions to the worm which dieth not, and 
            the fire which is not quenched.</said></p>
            
            <p><rs type="persGroup">The girls</rs> began to think him an unaccountable 
            <distinct>buckra</distinct>, and rather affected with insanity; more 
            especially as he persisted in his intention of proceeding 
            to the settlement of which they had given 
            him such an unfavourable account, and refused 
            their assurance, on the part of their master or the 
            overseer, of good quarters and hospitable entertainment 
            for the night. <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> would fain have 
            seconded their arguments, but his <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs> silenced 
            him with a gloomy frown; and after a few more 
            desultory observations to <rs type="persGroup">the women</rs>, with some 
            of whom he chose to shake hands, the head of 
            <ecda:fauna>the Spanish steed</ecda:fauna> was turned toward the mountains; 
            and <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> again seizing its tail, master and 
            man resumed their course. The short twilight 
            expired, and the shadows of night rendered still 
            more sombre the forlorn and unfrequented path 
            along which they journeyed.</p>

            <p>he had left, and lingered onwards most reluctantly, 
            in spite of sundry kicks bestowed on his 
            ribs by his fractious <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs>, whose impatience 
            increased with the storm which already penetrated 
            through his garments. A tropical wetting is but 
            too often precursor and cause of those baleful 
            fevers which are almost the only curse upon the 
            otherwise blissful climate of the <placeName ref="#antilles">Antilles</placeName>,—blissful 
            in the idea of the inhabitants; and our <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">traveller</rs>, 
            already initiated in the miseries of this scourge, 
            was but too full of apprehensions and forebodings, 
            as he felt the tempest invade him to the skin.</p>
            
            <p>The thoughts of a sick bed, or sickness without 
            a bed, without medicine, in an abandoned 
            dwelling in the midst of the jungle, as it was 
            represented to him, crowded fast on his perturbed 
            imagination, which now first reproached him for 
            the expedition he had undertaken, although the 
            feeling was purely selfish: however, it was of short 
            duration; the uproar of the elements increased 
            so rapidly and violently, that all apprehensions 
            for the past or the future quickly yielded to more 
            immediate fears for his present personal safety. 
            They had been for some time ascending, and had 
            now gained the summit of a steep hill, whence 
            the road began to descend as abruptly into another 
            dingle, through which they could discover, by the 
            occasional flashes of lightning, a river of more 
            importance than the many petty streams they

            the volume of water it had presented to them 
            some miles below; and how were they to pass it? 
            or how indeed were they to reach it? The road, 
            scarcely three feet wide, wound along the side of a 
            precipice, against which the wind raged with such 
            fury, and the rain beat so spitefully, that the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> 
            for a long time refused to face either of them, and 
            was at last driven down into the valley by <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs> 
            and <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">man</rs> on foot, urging him with sticks, and 
            preventing him from turning round in the narrow 
            path, so slippery and precipitous that he slid 
            down the last portion of it on his hind quarters, 
            and rolled over and over into the narrow plain 
            below, bursting his girths and scattering abroad 
            his harness and the portmanteau, umbrella, and 
            great coat. These were, however, readjusted 
            with a promptitude inspired by the occasion, and 
            with a resolution which was little else than the 
            effect of despair; the river was passed in comparative 
            safety; <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName>, who led the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>, only 
            stumbling occasionally over the loose rocks which 
            strewed its channel. But scarcely had they 
            reached the <distinct xml:lang="la">terra firma</distinct> on the other side, when 
            <rs ref="cuffy_0001" type="person">the terrified boy</rs> cried out that the earth shook 
            beneath him, and ran up the path which they had 
            found, as if he expected the river to rise and 
            arrest him, or hurry him with its waters down its

            <fw type="pageNum">12</fw> 
               
            impetuous current. The <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>, no less alarmed, 
            or afraid of losing his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">negro guide and friend</rs>, 
            hastened after him. Another eminence was gained, 
            from whence a track of fire was driving apparently at a 
            great distance before the wind. "Earthquakes 
            are not uncommon," thought <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs>; "but 
            fire—this must be produced by human means." 
            <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> thought otherwise; more especially when 
            he descried other fires in different directions, and 
            one or two now and then flashing into view at no 
            very great apparent distance. The earth shook 
            again; and the wind, as if it had still reserved 
            some of its power for an effort of desperation, 
            burst on them with such exasperated fury, that 
            it seemed impossible to make farther progress 
            against it. <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> clung to the boughs and the 
            rocks beside him; and his master being fain to 
            follow his example, the steed, with equipage, 
            was left to the mercy of the elements, from 
            which they saw him gradually recede to the 
            distance of fifty or sixty yards, like a ship 
            driving at her anchors and going bodily to leeward, 
            until he was lost in the darkness. <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName>, 
            true to his trust, abandoned his hold to keep 
            sight of his master's baggage; while his master, 
            encumbered with his spatterdashes, and fearful of 
            following the fate of his Bucephalus, encouraged 
            his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">valet</rs> to stand by the horse, and took a firmer

            grasp of the rocks from which he sought protecion. 
            Often and often was his voice lost in the 
            tumult of the storm, as he shouted to his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">boy</rs> for 
            some assurance of his safety. No answer reached 
            his ears—no sound but that of the elements 
            raging as if to produce a second chaos, thunder 
            and wind, the roaring of the augmented waterfalls, 
            the rumbling of the rocks which they loosed 
            from their beds, the creaking and crashing of 
            falling trees. It was in vain that the lightning at 
            every other instant illuminated the scene with its 
            partial flashes, now here, now there: it gleamed 
            only on mountains uncultivated and uninhabited, 
            (except perhaps by a few outlawed runaways who 
            lived by a predatory warfare on the wild hogs and 
            pigeons of the desart,) on naked precipices and 
            foaming torrents, or on the giant <rs ana="flora">trees</rs> of the forest 
            quivering beneath the blast of the hurricane. Then 
            came down the rain, not as in the temperate zone 
            even in its most weeping seasons, when the spectator 
            would fain imagine a second deluge; but 
            torrents, sheets of water, seemed to rush from the 
            clouds, and threaten the annihilation of all life 
            beneath the sky. The forlorn and dispirited <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">traveller</rs>, 
            still clinging to the rocks which yielded 
            him a partial and precarious kind of security, had 
            groped his way along them to a chink, in whose 
            recesses he flattered himself with an idea of 
            weathering the storm till daylight, drenched—
            
               
            <pb/> 
            <fw type="pageNum">14</fw> 
            
            nay, almost drowned—as he was by this time; but 
            even here the elementary war pursued him; a 
            stream of water began to ripple down the chink, 
            soon swelling to a torrent, augmented by another 
            which found its way through the chasms of the 
            precipice as if it had burst from some subterranean 
            reservoir. <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">The traveller</rs>'s situation became 
            insupportable; he must remove or perish; yet 
            not daring to quit the crags to which he clung, 
            and availing himself of the partial lee they afforded, 
            he essayed to clamber up the face of the precipice, 
            and with much difficulty and struggling 
            reached the edge of the chink whence the torrent 
            fell. Here he found himself comparatively safe in 
            a long narrow passage or natural alley, in which 
            he was at least secured from the wind by the 
            high and inaccessible rocks on either side of it. 
            Yet as the torrent still flowed over his feet and half 
            way up his legs, he waded onwards to find a spot 
            of higher ground, or an insulated piece of rock 
            that might elevate him above the stream, and 
            with this hope pursued the course of it for above 
            a hundred yards, till he came to a chasm that 
            opened on it from another mass of rocks, between 
            which and his present station another brawling 
            cataract, at depth of fifty feet beneath him, 
            found its way towards the streams which united 
            in the <placeName ref="#rio_grande">Rio Grande</placeName> below. A fallen tree formed a 
            bridge across this fissure, on the opposite side of 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">15</fw>
            
            which the mouth of a cave might be distinguished 
            by a glare of the lightning, sufficient in appearance 
            to ensure our <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">traveller</rs> shelter and safety for 
            the night—shelter from the rain, and security from 
            the wind. It was a most perilous undertaking to 
            pass this bridge; but prompted by hope, and urged 
            by misery and fear, he ventured on its uncertain 
            surface, keeping his balance by means of a branch 
            that hung from the opposite side, which, with 
            much ado, he reached at last without accident. 
            Here he found what appeared to him steps cut by 
            human art for some height in the face of the rock: 
            he ascended them, and walked into the cave.</p>

            <p>As soon as <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs> found himself safe from 
            the storm, he sat down on the floor of the cave, 
            and burst into a flood of tears; and something like 
            an acknowledgment of heaven's mercy passed 
            his lips. His next thought was for his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">boy</rs> and 
            his equipage, the <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> and the portmanteau; 
            nor was he long in adverting to the deplorable 
            condition in which he yet found himself, drenched 
            with rain, and exhausted with the fatigue of having 
            borne up against the passion of the hurricane. 
            To sit still might be fatal to him in this state, and 
            he had even thoughts of stripping off his wet garments, 
            and parading the cave, as far as he could 
            see into it, till daylight; but was checked by the 
            idea which he could not dismiss of stepping on 
            <ecda:fauna>scorpions</ecda:fauna> or <ecda:fauna>centipedes</ecda:fauna>, or becoming an easier 
            prey to the <ecda:fauna>musquitos</ecda:fauna> which like himself had 
            here found a refuge from the weather. While he 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">17</fw>
            
            yet mused on the manner in which he was to pass 
            the hours till morning, his olfactory nerves became 
            sensible of a smell of fire,—the smoke of burning 
            wood, which evidently came from the interior of 
            the cave; and hastily concluding it to be owing to 
            one of the wandering fires he had seen abroad, he 
            explored his way through the cavern towards the 
            smell, expecting to find an outlet on the other 
            side of the mountain, through which he calculated 
            the smoke was driven perhaps from a distance. 
            The odour and its vapour increased as he proceeded; 
            and he had not made a very long or very painful 
            march, before he began to perceive a glimmering 
            of light, by which he attained an inner apartment 
            as it were of a cave, filled it is true with smoke, 
            but in some measure illuminated by the fire from 
            which it exhaled; not one of the wandering fires 
            of the wilderness, but a fire of burning brands laid 
            on the floor of the apartment too evidently by 
            human hands. "This," thought he, "is at least the 
            abode of man: runaway slave, Maroon, or robber, 
            I will yet claim his hospitality; my situation 
            cannot be worse, and what have I to lose? 
            But where is <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the tenant</rs> of the dwelling? Here 
            are <ecda:food>plantains</ecda:food> too, not long roasted, and <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food>; and 
            what are these?" he added, taking up some garments 
            that lay on the floor, a <distinct>contoo</distinct>, and an 
            instrument of music, a <distinct>bonjaw</distinct>. "Let us at least 
            summon the master of the cave. What ho! hilloh!"

            <fw type="pageNum">18</fw>
            
            The voice died away unheeded, and the traveller 
            listened to its echoes until he felt almost afraid 
            and ashamed to disturb the silence again. Yet 
            he mustered courage to exert his voice a second 
            and a third time, though as at first ineffectually. 
            Sufficiently removed from the storm without, to 
            hear no more of it than an occasional murmur 
            which stole along the vault he had penetrated, 
            too faint to cause him any farther concern, his 
            own voice was reverberated on his ears with a
            force from which he shrank within himself, so 
            painful was it to his oppressed and agitated 
            nerves. He called no more; but conforming himself 
            with a philosophical moderation to the hour 
            and the scene in which he found himself, he trimmed 
            the fire; took off his wet clothes, which he 
            wrung and disposed around it; attired himself in 
            the <distinct>contoo</distinct> of his <rs type="person">invisible host</rs>; and wrapping his 
            feet in a blanket which lay beside it, helped himself
            from the calabash of <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food>, and put some of the 
            <ecda:food>plantains</ecda:food> on the fire again to warm. He had 
            seated himself on a bundle of sticks, and as he 
            took a second taste of the <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food> calabash, surveyed 
            at his leisure, by the cheerful blaze he had made, 
            the extent and furniture of his apartment.</p>
            
            <p>It was a lofty cavern hewn by the hand of nature 
            in the otherwise solid lime-stone rock, from 
            the roof of which hung many stalactites, whose 
            points were blackened by the smoke from the fire 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">19</fw>
            
            beneath. Besides the opening by which <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs> 
            had entered, there were four other apertures, 
            each leading, as it seemed from the glimpse 
            he had taken of them, to the other recesses in the 
            rock, and so much resembling each other that he 
            could not now distinctly ascertain that which had 
            admitted him. Alarmed for a moment as this discovery, 
            he arose from his seat, and taking a firebrand 
            from the blazing pile, would fain have explored 
            these vomitories, into each of which he 
            walked a few paces, without however deriving the 
            information he required, or gaining any but a conviction 
            that they extended farther than he was 
            disposed at present to penetrate. He next surveyed 
            the precincts of the cave itself, and its rather 
            curious contents. In a recess stood a couple of 
            spears, one solely of hard wood, whose point was 
            rendered still harder by fire; the other was shod 
            with iron and rusted apparently with blood; a 
            bamboo rod, ten feet in length and about an inch 
            in thickness, leaned against the rock beside them, 
            carved or tattoed from end to end. In another 
            angle of the vault was a calabash filled with various 
            sorts of hair, among which it was easy to discriminate 
            that of white men, <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna>dogs</ecda:fauna>. 
            These were huddled together, and crowded with 
            feathers of various <ecda:fauna>birds</ecda:fauna>, especially those of 
            <ecda:fauna>domestic poultry</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>wild parrots</ecda:fauna>, with one or 
            two of the spoils of a <ecda:fauna>macaw</ecda:fauna>. A human skull

            <fw type="pageNum">20</fw>
            
            was placed beside this calabash, from which the 
            teeth were missing; but on turning it up, <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the traveller</rs> 
            found them with a quantity of broken glass 
            crammed into the cerebellum, and covered up with 
            a wad of silk cotton, to prevent them from falling 
            out. There were several other skulls in a second 
            recess, some perfect, some which had been broken 
            apparently with a sharp pointed instrument, and 
            many of them serving as calabashes or boxes to 
            hold the strange property of <rs type="person">the master of the 
            cave</rs>; one was a receptacle for gunpowder, which 
            <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the inquisitive traveller</rs> narrowly escaped inflaming; 
            a second contained bullets and shot of various 
            sizes, mixed with old nails and pieces of rag; 
            and from a third he saw with no little horror a 
            <ecda:fauna>black snake</ecda:fauna> uncoil itself the moment he touched 
            it. There were three muskets, all old and out of 
            order; a pistol and two cutlasses, disposed on different 
            ledges of the rock; a large conch-shell 
            fitted with a belt of mahoe bark, to be worn over 
            the shoulder, hung from a projection, with several 
            other pieces of rope made of similar materials, to 
            which were attached rings of wood and hollowed 
            stones, perhaps intended for amulets or charms. 
            A lamp of clay at last arrested his attention; it 
            had carved on it some rude figures and was filled 
            with oil of the <ecda:flora>Palma Christi</ecda:flora>, having a wick 
            formed of the fibres of the <ecda:flora>plantain</ecda:flora> stalk. This 
            the intruder took the liberty of illuming, to assist

            him more conveniently than did his flickering 
            firebrand in the farther search he seemed disposed 
            to prosecute. By the help of this he espied a 
            pair of shoepatters, a sort of coarse sandal, and a 
            red cloak resembling the South-American poncho. 
            Some <ecda:food>salted fish</ecda:food> was suspended from a part of the 
            roof, with a large calabash of <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food>, and another of 
            coarse <ecda:food>salt</ecda:food>; and an earthen jar contained no 
            small store of <ecda:food>salted pork</ecda:food>. There were several 
            pieces of <ecda:food>jerked hog</ecda:food> hanging from a stick 
            placed across this recess, to one of which he 
            helped himself without ceremony; and thinking 
            he had made sufficient search for the present, 
            returned to the fire, on which he heaped fresh fuel, 
            raking forward the embers to cook his meat: 
            placed his lamp on a shelf of the rock full in his 
            view; and taking a <distinct>gombah</distinct> for his stool, sat down 
            very deliberately to his supper. He ate with no 
            sparing appetite; and the <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food> which he quaffed 
            as his thirst prompted him, refreshed his body 
            and composed his mind so happily and so gradually, 
            that what with that and his fatigue, the 
            solace of the fire and the fumes of his digestion, 
            he at last slipt gently from his <distinct>gombah</distinct>, which 
            now served him for a pillow, rolled himself up in 
            his blanket, and fell into a profound sleep.</p>

             <p>DEEP and leaden as were the slumbers of our 
             <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">traveller</rs>, his mind was not wholly relieved from 
             the cares of this world, for which, sleeping or 
             waking, nature seems by some perversion from 
             her original and benevolent purpose to have 
             formed this our enslaved, if not incarcerated, 
             sensorium: not but that there are dreams of all 
             denominations—visions of bliss, as well as of 
             sorrow; but the first are still dependent on terrestrial 
             objects, human interests and passions, as 
             well as the latter; and where is the mind that 
             would not, at many periods of even a short life, 
             have consented to wipe away from its tablets the 
             very memory of those, to escape the painful rememberances 
             of these? The brains of our <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">weather-
             beaten sleeper</rs> were not long idle. He fancied

             himself still contending with the elements, and 
             striving in vain to save his boy <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> from the 
             storm, or keep his own seat on his Spanish horse, 
             which succeeded in kicking his <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">master</rs> into a 
             river, whose waves were waves of fire. Then 
             again he fancied himself sauntering by moonlight on 
             the banks of another, a clear and crystal stream, 
             whence he descried at a distance the buildings of 
             a sugar estate on fire. He ran towards it. From 
             the great house (as the principal dwelling is 
             called) <ecda:anonPers>a female figure</ecda:anonPers>, young and beautiful, 
             looked out, imploring help. The passion of <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the 
             sleeper</rs> was awakended; he clambered into the 
             piazza, reconducted <ecda:anonPers>the lady</ecda:anonPers> to her chamber, assured 
             her of her safety, and in spite of her distress, 
             presumed to talk to her of his love; nay, 
             insensible to all but his own selfish feelings, attempted 
             to pollute her with his caresses. She 
             died in his arms, as he thought, curseing him for 
             his cruelty; and as he shrunk with horror from 
             her inanimate and ghastly corpse, he saw a fiend 
             arise from her bed, fix on him its eyes glaring 
             with a malignant fury, by a threatening action 
             command him to silence, and trace on 
             his forehead, in burning characters, the fearful 
             syllable death. The only sound which escaped 
             the lips of the demon was that of his own name 
             -<persName ref="#roland_0001">Roland</persName>! <persName ref="roland_0001">Roland</persName>!-articulated in a voice of

            sat upright for an instant, and stared wildly 
            around, scarce recollecting his own identity or

            <p><rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">This figure</rs> stood before the lamp, whose rays

            from his eyeballs. He stood in an attitude which 
            <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the dreamer</rs>'s fears quickly determined to be the 
            menacing posture of the demon from which he 
            had shrunk; the forefinger of his right hand elevated, 
            the left hand leaning on a bamboo staff.

            replied <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Negro</rs>, as if he had not adverted to 
            the question. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">There was once <ecda:anonPers>one</ecda:anonPers> who fled 
            towards it for refuge, not from a hurricane, but 
            from the punishment of crimes and misdeeds.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">What had he committed?</said> said <persName ref="roland_0001">Roland</persName></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">It was told of him, but I know not how

            his <ecda:anonPers>daughter</ecda:anonPers> in a fit of jealousy. He galloped 
            from his pursuers, and scrambled up the 
            pass you found, where they could not follow him; 
            and halting at the bridge, invoked the white 
            man's God to help him over; but he slipped, and 
            tumbled down the gully.</said></p>
            
            <p>While this conversation took place, <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Negro</rs> 
            had renewed the fire, taken a piece of <ecda:food>salted 
            pork</ecda:food> from the jar, put it into an iron pot with 
            some water in it, which <persName ref="roland_0001">Roland</persName> had overlooked 
            in his examination of the premises, and set it 
            on the fire to boil. He produced some <ecda:food>water</ecda:food>

            <fw type="pageNum">28</fw>
            
            also from one of the recesses, with which he 
            mixed himself some <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food> in a small calabash; 
            and after the libation of a little on the earth, 
            drank to the health of the white man. <persName ref="roland_0001">Roland</persName> 
            was neither pleased nor surprised to see him 
            find the food and materials he required with 
            so much ease and familiarity; not doubting that 
            he was at least one of the proprietors of the cave, 
            according to his account of them. But though he 
            felt a confidence in the hospitality of one who 
            could, had he been so disposed, have taken his 
            life while he was sleeping, still he could not 
            regard him without a suspicous feeling, and watched 
            him as he moved about the cave with the same 
            anxious scrutiny as that with which an alarmed cat 
            keeps sight of a <ecda:fauna>terrier dog</ecda:fauna> who has invaded the 
            stable or loft where her offspring are concealed. 
            He had full time to remark the singularity of his 
            dress and appearance, of which it may not be 
            improper to give the reader some idea; as <persName ref="#hamel_0001">Hamel</persName> 
            (by which name he was known) will probably

            <p><rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">This dealer in magic</rs>, for he was no less a personage, 
            was of a slight and elegant make, though

            the lines which that had traced on his features

            feeling hostile to his fellow-creatures, at war with 
            human nature, or dissatisfied with himself. He 
            was attired in a South American poncho, which 
            had once been of a bright scarlet colour, fastened 
            round his waist by a thin leathern girdle; and his 
            head was decorated with a red silk handkerchief, 
            tied in the fashion of a turban. He was barefooted, 
            and without any offensive weapon; for 
            such the bamboo wand on which he had leaned 
            could hardly be denominated. He moved with 
            an elasticity uncommon for his years; and his 
            manner indicated on his part perfect confidence, 
            wholly unsuspicious of his <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">guest</rs> or his purpose. 
            Yet it was but too evident to <persName ref="#roland_0001">Roland</persName>, that <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Negro</rs> 
            had evaded his questions as to the magic talents

            but as the use of Obeah is denounced by law, 
            however despised by <rs type="persGroup">white men</rs>, he could not 
            attach any particular consequence to such evasion,

            was perhaps one which his recollection had almost

            deeds which preyed on his memory. Misfortune 
            and guilt might have claimed an equal share in 
            that: passion and remorse had been the cause 
            and consequence of these, which had as yet escaped 
            detection; as had indeed the first alluded to—

            alone. Yet <persName ref="#hamel_0001">Hamel</persName> had only charged him with 
            shedding blood. The particulars of the circumstance 
            might be a mystery to him still; or he 
            might have made a vague charge on the suggestion 
            solely of his own fancy, taking the chance of 
            getting credit for displaying a supernatural power, 
            to acquire a natural one over the mind of a white 
            man, whose business at any rate he seemed to 
            understand; whose business, if discovered to the 
            authorities of the island, would be death. Death! 
            <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">The Missionary</rs>'s mind glowed with the thought, 
            and his heart died almost within him, as the conviction

            of it. <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">The Missionary</rs>'s feelings had betrayed 
            him into an avowal of guilt of some kind, an 
            avowal of which <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the wizard</rs> would not fail to

            into repose after a storm, <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs> had laid 
            aside <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Negro</rs>'s blanket and contoo, in which he 
            had been enveloped, and resumed his own more 
            appropriate dress. He trimmed the lamp, and fed 
            the fire, as if not altogether in charity with darkness; 
            and seeing by his watch that it must needs 
            be daylight abraod, began to explore the passage 
            from the cave by which <persName ref="#hamel_0001">Hamel</persName> had so suddenly 
            disappeared: for he had made his own ingress; 
            nor is to be supposed that he was ambitious of 
            again passing over that awful gully, by the bridge 
            which, according to <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah man</rs>'s account, 
            the Enemy of mankind had constructed, and reserved 
            for his own particular friends. However, 
            his fortune did not favour him here; a few yards 
            in darkness brought him to a spot whence he 
            could feel two or three currents of air, evidently 
            issuing from as many passages in the rock; and 
            the sounds of his feet, now equipped with his 
            iron-heeled boots, echoed along these galleries 
            in so many directions, that he became afraid of 
            trusting himself beyond the extent of the spot at 
            which he had halted. The lamp was portable, 
            and might assist him in unravelling the labyrinth; 
            without it he must, as he thought, be lost. He 
            returned to possess himself of it' and as he reentered 
            the cave by the same apeture as that by

            as he stepped into the chief apartment of the

            with this indignant feeling, he traversed the cave 
            with an impatient step, as if intent on quitting 
            it, and looking alternately into the various openings 
            which led from it, as if determined to try his

            tried to pacify him; his passion seemed to augment 
            with the concessions of the others; and he 
            continued to denounce <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the wizard</rs> as an agent of

            about him as they returned from the light of the

            on the features of <rs type="persGroup">the two Negroes</rs>, he caught up 
            a machet, and made another sally through a different 
            opening, along which <rs type="persGroup">the tenants</rs> of the 
            cave could hear him groping and stumbling, now 
            shouting, then grumbling again; hacking the

            fiends who inhabited this den of his <rs ref="hamel_0001" type="person">evil genius</rs>, 
            if such a being could exist. His mental and 
            secret determination was to denounce <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah 
            man</rs>, whom he was resolved to bring to justice; 
            but of this nought escaped his lips even in 
            murmurs. Thus blundering on, he reached at 
            last the daylight, and beheld the chasm which

            to the westward. They might be compared to 
            wounded stragglers in the rear of a victorious 
            army; the followers of the storm; harmless, impotent 
            indications of the violence which had preceded 
            them. The distant sea sparkled in the sun, 
            while its huge waves still retained the elasticity 
            which the hurricane had imparted to them, their 
            summits flashing with white spray, hurried along 
            by the wind, like tears chased from the sunny
            cheeks of youth by hope:—but let us leave metaphors. 
            A considerable plain lay beneath the eyes 
            of <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Methodist</rs>, between the sea and the woods 
            which he immediately overlooked to the eastward. 
            It was here that he could trace the progress of the 
            fires which had alarmed him the previous night. 
            The had raged through a great extent of long 
            <ecda:flora>grass</ecda:flora>, withered by the dry season, and kindled by 
            the negligence of <rs type="persGroup">runaway Negroes</rs>; and although

            the rain had now quenched their flames, it was 
            very apparent, by the blackened acres they had 
            left, and the smoke yet reeking from them, that 
            their fury must have been uncontrollable except 
            by nature's own efforts; and that, once within 
            their influence, all escape from them would have 
            been impossible to any human being. <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">The Missionary</rs>'s 
            course lay across a part of this plain, as 
            he thought, where he contemplated only dust and 
            ashes; and willing to see everything that related 
            to himself in the best light possible, he was fain 
            to attribute the storm he had weathered to the 
            providence of heaven interposing to save the life 
            of one so valuable to <rs type="persGroup">the unchristian Negroes</rs> 
            whom he yet meant to enlighten metaphysically 
            and spiritually. Every stream was yet swollen, 
            and the <placeName ref="#rio_grande">Rio Grande</placeName> rolled among a mass of foam 
            which marked its course high above its usual and 
            natural banks; while fragments of rock and 
            broken <ecda:flora>trees</ecda:flora>, to the euthusiast's imagination, rose 
            and fell as the waves hurled and tossed them 
            about, like condemned spirits tossing on the restless 
            billows of Hades. He felt a sort of pride in 
            the idea, and looked around, bewildered for a moment, 
            in search of some more or less pious fellow-
            creature who might applaud or envy him for the 
            conceit: but his own safety diverted his attention 
            to other objects. He stood at the mouth of the 
            gallery, as we have stated, where the face of the

            perpendicular rock beneath was cut into some 
            shallow steps leading to a narrow ledge, whence a 
            tree hung over that frightful chasm called the 
            Devil's Gully; a chasm not more than fifteen feet 
            across, but apparently of an immense profundity; 
            for, owing to his present position, <rs ref="roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs> 
            could not see down to the current of water which had 
            perhaps formed and now occupied it as its channel 
            to the <placeName ref="#rio_grande">Rio Grande</placeName>. Another <ecda:flora>tree</ecda:flora> lay across the 
            gully; but though he had passed this bridge in the 
            dark, it was too awful to be encountered in the light, 
            which served only to make manifest the danger he 
            had escaped; nay, so terrible did the very descent 
            to it appear down the face of the rock, that he 
            had not hardihood enough to attempt it, urged as he 
            was by horror and disgust of the abominations he 
            had seen in <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the wizard</rs>'s cavern, by his ambition 
            to denounce <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah man</rs>, and his anxiety to 
            regain the habitations of civilized life, for more 
            than one purpose which he had at heart. It was in 
            vain that he strained his neck in every direction, 
            to spy out some hope for effecting his escape, 
            some human being who might come to his assistance; 
            in vain he searched with his eyes every 
            <ecda:flora>bush</ecda:flora> beneath him for his boy <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName>, and his 
            <ecda:fauna>Spanish horse</ecda:fauna>, and all his moveables. The 
            mountain path was not visible from his eyrie, 
            and the jungle concealed everything that could 
            have consoled him, encouraged him, or given

            him a hope of emancipation from <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah 
            man</rs>'s abode and power. Hour after hour 
            elapsed as <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs> still contemplated the 
            scene before him; and he began to feel again the 
            calls of hunger, as well as to entertain some little 
            surprise that neither <persName ref="#hamel_0001">Hamel</persName> nor <persName ref="combah_0001">Combah</persName> interfered 
            with or even followed him. What could 
            be their motive for thus neglecting him? Did they 
            calculate on starving  him into submission to their 
            plans, knowing the almost insurmountable difficulties 
            he must encounter in attempting to descend 
            the rocks? His life was in their power, 
            but that was not worth their taking; moreover 
            <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName> depended much on him for his influence 
            with the Christian part of the population; and 
            <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName> was a Christian. If <hi rend="italics">he</hi> could be prevailed 
            on, <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the wizard</rs> might be kept in check; nay, was it 
            not prudent after all to give or appear to give way 
            to <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah man</rs>, who had such a strange and perverse 
            power over the minds of <rs type="persGroup">the Blacks</rs>? The 
            point once gained, the rebellion in vigour, <persName ref="#hamel_0001">Hamel</persName> 
            might be outwitted, anyhow disposed of; it were 
            no sin to slay an accomplice of the devil, or 
            to launch him from his fastness into the dingles 
            below. <said rend="quotes" aloud="false">Indeed,</said> thought he, as the reflection

            fact, any longer stay in his present position was 
            evidently absurd, as he was utterly afraid to attempt 
            a descent; and happen what might, he must return 
            through <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah man</rs>'s apartment, before he 
            could regain the abode<unclear>s</unclear> of <rs type="persGroup">white men</rs>. There 
            was <ecda:anonPers>a lady</ecda:anonPers> too in the case; a young person on 
            whom he had set his affections, whom he desired 
            ardently to revisit, as soon as he should have 
            effected the purpose for which he had undertaken 
            his journey to the abandoned settlement noticed 
            in a previous part of this narrative. Without the 
            help of <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName>, he knew not how to assure himself 
            of any success with this young person; for she 
            had not as yet returned his love, nor any acknowledgment 
            of it or for it. She would neither listen 
            to nor even look on him, if she could avoid it; and 
            she had been heard to express no less horror of 
            him and his misplaced affection, than that which 
            <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs> himself had felt for <persName ref="#hamel_0001">Hamel</persName> and 
            his office. This feeling had incensed <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Methodist</rs> 
            without at all diminishing his love, which 
            was of a nature more passionate perhaps than 
            refined. It wounded him besides in the tenderest 
            part of his spirituality, his vanity; for he knew 
            that she preferred <ecda:anonPers>another one</ecda:anonPers>, whom he was 
            accustomed to regard as a worthless, irreligious, 
            profane, and at the same time daring adventurer, 
            who had scoffed at him and his <hi rend="italics">religion</hi>, and 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">52</fw>
            
            denounced him publicly as a cheat and an impostor. 
            To circumvent <ecda:anonPers>this youth</ecda:anonPers>, and to gain possession 
            of <ecda:anonPers>the lady</ecda:anonPers>, had been the first motives for 
            his league with <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName>. In the confusion of 
            a revolt, successful or unsuccessful, an opportunity 
            would be contrived by the <rs ref="#combah_0001" type="person">would-be king</rs> 
            and his followers for <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs> to seize and 
            carry off his prize; at least he had so bargained 
            with <rs ref="#combah_0001" type="person">his majesty</rs>. Once his, for ever his, thought 
            he; fraud, violence, would be compensated by the 
            offer of his hand; and his character was in too high 
            esteem among all ranks who knew him by name 
            and by his preaching, to suffer anything from the 
            breath of slander. This was his idea, supposing 
            the revolt to fail. If it succeeded, he 
            became the right-hand man of <rs ref="#combah_0001" type="person">the king</rs>, viceroy 
            over him, as <persName ref="#trinculo_0001">Trinculo</persName> happily observes; the 
            keeper of his conscience, high priest, pope protestant 
            of the island, with a beautiful girl for 
            his wife. <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">The enthusiast</rs>'s ambition was not so 
            immoderate as to extend farther than a desire for 
            dominion over the consciences of all <rs type="persGroup">the inhabitants</rs> 
            and their <rs ref="#combah_0001" type="person">monarch</rs>; but the monarch, it 
            seemed, had already revolted from his spiritual

            possibility of enlisting fiends and demons into

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="false">Well,</said> thought he, turning round to retrace

            The very thought made him shudder. <said rend="quotes" aloud="false">If argument

            <p>THE storm of the preceding night, whose violence 
            we have commemorated, had wrecked, no doubt, 
            many a gallant vessel and many a wayworn bark, 
            whose <rs type="persGroup">crews</rs>, sinking into the waves which ingulphed

            in history, with the exception of a few miserables

            in these pages.</p>
            
            <p>It was near midnight, and the storm was 
            at its height, and every house in the island which 
            had such means of defence barricadoed to resist it, 
            when <ecda:persGroup>a rather motley group of persons</ecda:persGroup>, eight or

            ten in number, knocked at the house of <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">a gentleman</rs> 
            in the parish of St Mary, and demanded the 
            rights of hospitality. This house was situated 
            within half a mile of the sea, at <!-- long dash --> Bay, and 
            <rs type="persGroup">the strangers</rs> said they had been wrecked in a 
            large canoe, with which they had crossed from 
            <placeName ref="cuba">Cuba</placeName>; where, as they farther stated, they had 
            been detained as prisoners by a party of <rs type="persGroup">pirates</rs>. 
            <rs type="persGroup">The inhabitants</rs> of the house were more surprised 
            at their being able to reach it, although to leeward 
            of the spot where they had been cast on 
            shore, than at their request to be received and entertained 
            in it; an indulgence to which all persons 
            in the island, in case of need at least, would have 
            fancied themselves entitled under any circumstances; 
            I should say all <ecda:persGroup><!-- hi rend="italics" -->white persons</ecda:persGroup>. A window 
            of the piazza was opened, and the party 
            reconnoitred, with the help of a lanthorn, by <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">an 
            old gentleman</rs> from within; for being <ecda:persGroup>strangers</ecda:persGroup> 
            and from another island, they were liable to a 
            little suspicion; and the mention of the word pirates 
            perhaps gave birth to an idea of the possibility 
            of their being themselves of that calling. They presented 
            themselves to the old gentleman's gaze in 
            succession; and the opened window being on the 
            lee side of the house, he could examine their features 
            with some little attention, and make what 
            enquiries he thought fit to put to them, so 
            as to be heard and answered; but the vio-

            lence of the storm threatening to burst in the 
            shutters on the weather-side of the piazza, it became 
            necessary, as a security in case of such an 
            accident, to shut the aforesaid window; for if the 
            gale should once gain passage through the house, 
            the building would inevitably go to pieces, and 
            its <ecda:persGroup>inhabitants</ecda:persGroup> might be blown away with the rest 
            of its contents; a circumstance that has occurred 
            more than once in this part of the globe. <ecda:persGroup>The 
            shipwrecked men</ecda:persGroup> were therefore admitted, after a 
            mutilated set of interrogatories through the piazza 
            window, which was closed and again barricadoed, 
            for fear the wind might shift; and all hands immediately 
            repaired, as if by instinct, to that portion 
            of the building which was more directly 
            threatened. Here <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">the owner</rs> of the mansion 
            resumed the labours he had evidently left but a 
            few minutes before, which consisted in pulling to 
            pieces a bedstead, with the materials of which he 
            was adding to his stauncheons and barricadoes; 
            almost heedless of his <ecda:persGroup>guests</ecda:persGroup>, whom he had commended 
            to the care of <ecda:anonPers>a Negro butler</ecda:anonPers>, desiring he 
            would furnish them from the beaufet with <ecda:commodity>rum</ecda:commodity> or

            except by quitting the mansion. But the

            menaced them, repaired at once to his assist-

            ance, and secured the bed-posts against the 
            shutters and doors, before they attended to any of 
            the other directions of their <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">host</rs>, or adverted to 
            the rest of the <ecda:persGroup>inmates</ecda:persGroup> of the dwelling, whose 
            situation seemed yet to require some attention, 
            after all measures of security had been completed. 
            It was then that one of the party, looking into a 
            chamber whose window opened upon the piazza, 
            beheld a <rs type="person">lady</rs> pale and almost insensible, supported 
            in an arm chair by <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">a <distinct>Quadroon</distinct> soubrette</rs>, 
            who applied a smelling bottle of some essence to 
            her nostrils with one hand, while with the other 
            she chafed her <rs type="person">mistress</rs>'s temples. It was but a 
            momentary glance in which <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the stranger</rs> indulged 
            —a feeling of delicacy prevented him from gazing 
            with too much curiosity; but it sufficed to convince 
            him that <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the soubrette</rs> was a very beautiful 
            girl, and that the lady herself was no ordinary 
            person; she looked but little turned of thirty 
            years of age, for her complexion was smooth, 
            clear, and bright, as if she had never known a tropical 
            climate; but it was the whiteness almost of 
            alabaster, without a tinge of blood in her cheek; 
            and as she lay in the arm chair so languid and 
            pale, her dark hair disheveled, a litle on her 
            brows, assumed a deeper hue, perhaps by so glaring 
            a contrast. She opened her eyes at the moment 
            that this stranger removed from his position; 
            and seeing a man in the piazza whom she neither 
            knew nor recollected to have seen before, uttered

            a faint and half-stifled cry as she clung to the 
            arms of <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the Quadroon</rs>.</p>

            to be a little confounded at the sight of 
            this <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">beautiful creature</rs>. her complexion was 
            nearly similar to that of her <rs type="person">mother</rs>, pale and delicate; 
            but her figure was firm and elastic, not 
            withstanding her alarm; and the scanty portion 
            of clothes in which she was clad, concealed but 
            little of its elegant outline. Her paleness might 
            be attributed to her apprehensions, for the colour 
            had even fled from her lips, or at least there was 
            but enough of the rose left there to characterize 
            her as an animated creature of this earth, who might 
            otherwise have been almost fancied a being 
            of another world. She was as fair as pale, with 
            large blue eyes, from which her terror had but 
            just chased her tears, as was but too evident from 
            the expression of grief still upon her features; and 
            with her hair partly bound round her head in 
            braids, partly disordered on her shoulders, and 
            waiving in the current of the wind, she wanted 
            only the chaplet of <ecda:flora>flowers</ecda:flora> which the painter has

            hue of a stout Sambo, is carrying off his prize 
            from her pastoral diversions to the realms of Tartarus. 
            But the figure of Pluto would not correspond

            and commanding manner, open and undisguised, 
            with nothing in his appearance indicative 
            of the robber or ravisher. He sighed as he looked 
            at her again, and quickly removed his gaze to his 
            <ecda:persGroup>companions</ecda:persGroup>, who were yet labouring for their 
            <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">host</rs> to secure the very spars of the roof, lest the 
            hurricane should tear that shelter from their heads. 
            <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">The young lady</rs> turned to her <rs type="person">mother</rs> with a view

            to time thanked his <ecda:persGroup>guests</ecda:persGroup> for their assistance, 
            without which his house and household would 
            have been, as he said, in but a very indifferent 
            plight; for <ecda:persGroup>the Negroes</ecda:persGroup> belonging to the estate, 
            in confirmation of the truth that charity begins at 
            home, had all abandoned their <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">master</rs>'s abode, to 
            guard each his own dwelling. At any other time, 
            at least upon a less serious occasion, his costume 
            and appearance would have excited a smile even 
            on the negro faces which were now turned on 
            him; for both almost bordered on the ludicrous. 
            In the hurry of quitting his chamber at the commencement 
            of the storm, he had put on a long 
            dressing gown of chintz or dark-figured cotton, 
            two-thirds of which had been since torn off by his 
            efforts and struggles in contending against the

            elements, so that it had become a sort of spencer, 
            which gave to view a pair of black silk breeches, 
            with large Spanish silver knee-buckles, matched, 
            though scarcely surpassed by another pair of the 
            same metal on his shoes. He was some fifty years 
            of age; and his hair, a mixture of brown and grey, 
            was combed from off his face with such accuracy 
            and perseverance to form a queue, tied close up 
            to his occiput, that it seemed to drag with it all 
            the muscular part and power of his cheeks, forehead, 
            nose, and mouth; so that many of his acquaintance 
            were accustomed to fancy he never 
            could shut his eyes without letting go his pigtail. 
            Indeed by the same rule he could never open them 
            to their full capability of extension; for the corners 
            were drawn forcibly towards his temples, resembling 
            in figure and effect those of the cayman; and 
            all he could do as to motion with these his half 
            opened window-lights, was to wink them once or 
            twice a day. Superadded to this rather droll 
            part of his physiognomy, one of the aforesaid eyes 
            was gifted with a most ominous cast in its vision, 
            and appeared to the spectator on whom it was intended 
            to be turned (under influence fo any 
            passion) to be contemplating the starts, or reading 
            calculations, (written by the imagination of which 
            it was the light,) in the penetralia of the brains 
            behind it. With all this singularity his materiel, 
            he displayed a most pompous though inof-

            fensive solemnity in his march, manners, deportment, 
            and address, which extended to the 
            language in which he sometimes buried rather than 
            clothed his thoughts. He had likewise a taste 
            for ornamenting his discourse with quotations from 
            <ecda:persGroup>the Latin authors</ecda:persGroup>; and though he understood or 
            appeared to understand the application and translation 
            of these elegancies, his <ecda:persGroup>hearers</ecda:persGroup> were not 
            always so fortunate, owing to some peculiarities 
            to which he was attached of now and then altering 
            the cases and genders of adjectives and articles.

            was taken by a boat's crew from a log of mahogany 
            of which he was making prize in the 
            ocean (having seen it with a glass from his piazza 
            window.) He had no sooner seen than he desired

            came up with and was himself securing it, when 
            a strange sail, which had been skulking under the

            prey; and before his <ecda:persGroup>Negroes</ecda:persGroup> could disengage him 
            from the log, he was a prisoner. Indeed he bid 
            them seek their own safety, for (his presence of

            of redeemign half a dozen slaves as well as

            himself, and had nearly lost his life for his prudence 
            or parsimony; <ecda:persGroup>the pirates</ecda:persGroup> threatening to 
            fling him into the sea, until he persuaded them 
            that <ecda:persGroup>the Negroes</ecda:persGroup> had rowed off from their own 
            fears. However, they carried him away; but being 
            happily taken into <placeName ref="#guadeloupe">Guadaloupe</placeName> by a French 
            cruizer, they were disposed of according to law; 
            and he, having proved his innocence, was dismissed 
            with great courtesy, and sent home. Upon 
            his arrival however, he found he had cause to regret 
            his absence; some of his buildings had been 
            burnt, it was supposed maliciously; and he had 
            found his <rs type="person">wife</rs> in a state of melancholy and ill 
            health, owing, as was said, to her alarm respecting 
            him, in the first place; and in the second, to 
            her terrors occasioned by the fire, from which to 
            this hour she had not recovered. These terrors 
            were revived on the present occasion. The combustion 
            of the elements, the earthquake which 
            had convulsed the house, the wind and the lightning, 
            however frequent in the island, all raging in 
            unison, had filled her with physical alarm, as well 
            as superstitious apprehensions, to which her state 
            of mind had left her but too subject. It was to 
            no purpose that her <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">husband</rs> argued with her on 
            the folly of such fancies; in vain that her <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">daughter</rs> 
            sought and practised every means of consoling 
            her. Though not insensible, she appeared to be 
            indifferent to both, to everything that had hitherto

            <fw type="pageNum">64</fw>
            
            given her any sort of consolation or interest. She 
            even preferred, or seemed to prefer, the absence of 
            her <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">daughter</rs>, as if the sight of  this her only child 
            increased her agitations, and as if those attentions 
            which <persName ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001">Joanna</persName> too fondly paid her, excited only 
            painful recollections. So, in the midst of her present 
            alarms, she had in a manner banished her 
            daughter to her own chamber, and accepted the 
            services of <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the soubrette</rs>; and hence the tears 
            and distress of the former, for whose presence 
            she had only called at the sight of <ecda:persGroup>the strange 
            guests</ecda:persGroup> with whom the storm had accommodated

            to take time by the forelock, can secure <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">the young 
            lady</rs> before a fear or suspicion of a revolt should 
            affect the minds of <ecda:persGroup>the inhabitants</ecda:persGroup>. With this 
            feeling a canoe had been provided, whose <ecda:persGroup>crew</ecda:persGroup> 
            were to hover on the coast, sometimes at sea, 
            sometimes on shore, as occasion might require. 
            They were to watch to windward for a certain 
            signal, at the signt of which they were, if necessary, 
            to attack the house of <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>; at any 
            rate to seize the young lady, hurry her away to 
            the canoe, and bring her, not to the abandoned 
            settlement behind <placeName ref="#port_antonio">Port Antonio</placeName>, but to the cave 
            of <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah man</rs>. This signal was to be the 
            kindling of three fires on one of the ridges of the 
            <placeName ref="#blue_mountains">Blue Mountain</placeName>; and we have seen how it 
            happened that on the night in question <persName ref="#roland_0001">Roland</persName> 
            and his boy <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> had looked with no little terror 
            on as many if not more of these wandering flames; 
            which, although they had been accidentally 
            kindled by <ecda:persGroup>runaway Negroes</ecda:persGroup>, had carried a conviction 
            to the minds of <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName>'s delegates, that 
            this was their signal, and that now was the moment 
            for going to work. But the storm had run 
            their canoe on the rocks, damaged it, and, as they

            feared, almost beaten it to pieces. It was not without 
            difficulty that they saved their lives; and 
            to escape from the hurricane, they had ultimately 
            been obliged to ask hospitality at the very dwelling 
            against whose inmates they had meditated 
            such horrible violence. Their plan therefore (at 
            least for the present) was suspended, if not frustrated; 
            for although they might have carried off 
            <persName ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001">Joanna</persName> by sea, it would be worse than madness 
            to attempt such a scheme by land; nay, it would 
            be impossible, except the whole country were in 
            open revolt; and even then it would be no easy 
            matter to persuade <ecda:persGroup><persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>'s Negroes</ecda:persGroup> to 
            suffer such violence to be done to him on any pretence. 
            These were ideas which had been commmunicated 
            among <ecda:persGroup>the party</ecda:persGroup> as they groped their 
            way in the storm to the mansion where we have 
            introduced them. Once within it, they had little 
            opportunity of comparing notes or hatching any 
            fresh schemes, or even of mutual converse: they 
            were occupied with <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">the master of the house</rs> in 
            counteracting the fury of the wind; and although 
            they had had a sight of <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">the fair creature</rs> who had 
            been marked for their prey, there was but one of 
            them who had been allowed more than a momentary 
            look at her; and he, strange to say, had 
            turned them aside from the contemplation of a 
            person whom they had in some sort hired him to 
            steal, or to assist in stealing. <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">This stranger</rs> they

            he described himself to have fled from the cruelty

            make property of him. His story might be true 
            or false; but at any rate he had ingratiated himself 
            so far in their good opinion, as to have learnt 
            the purpose for which they were bound to <placeName ref="#jamaica">Jamaica</placeName>; 
            and on the plea of avenging himself on <ecda:anonPers>the 
            tyrant</ecda:anonPers> who had oppressed him, he had been permitted, 
            and finally encouraged, to take part with 
            them in their enterprise; more particularly, as he 
            gave them reason to see that he was acquainted 
            with the part of the island in which the scene of 
            their affair was to be laid, and with the house in 
            question; although he owned no knowledge of its 
            inmates. <hi rend="italics">He</hi> was to assist in carrying off <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">the

            vengeance on the unjust and inhuman tyrant 
            who had practised against his liberty and independence. 
            But let us return to <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>This <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">unsuspecting gentleman</rs>, occupied more 
            with the danger which had threatened his mansion 
            from the fury of the elements, than with the 
            fears and fancies of his <rs type="person">wife</rs>, to which time had a 
            little hardened him, succeeded eventually, with 
            the assistance of his <ecda:persGroup>guests</ecda:persGroup>, in securing his doors 
            and windows, and the spars of his house; and, in 
            short, enabled it to weather the gale, which abated, 
            as we have seen, towards morning, and had

            so far subsided by daylight, as to admit of the 
            defences being withdrawn for the purposes of 
            ingress and egress.</p>
            
            <p><rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">The old gentleman</rs>'s gratitude as well as hospitality, 
            begun now to manifest themselves more 
            visibly in his wishes and offers of rewards and 
            refreshments, for the services he had received 
            from his <ecda:persGroup>strange guests</ecda:persGroup>; offers which he, with 
            apparent difficulty only, could prevail on them to 
            accept—that is, as to the rewards. The refreshments 
            they declined; not thinking it advisable 
            perhaps to continue under the roof of one to 
            whom they had meditated so deep an injury, especailly 
            as his <ecda:persGroup>Negroes</ecda:persGroup> began to assemble about 
            the premises, and learnt with some feeling of 
            shame and surprise, that their <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">master</rs> owed the 
            preservation of his house to <ecda:persGroup>a band of strange 
            people of colour</ecda:persGroup>. Nay, <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName> spared no 
            pains to encrease their shame, in vaunting to them 
            the noble and disinterested endeavours of these 
            <ecda:persGroup>good men</ecda:persGroup>, as he called them, who had so fortunately 
            come to his assistance, when his own 
            <ecda:persGroup>Negroes</ecda:persGroup> had left him to the mercy of the storm.</p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes">I tell you,</said> cried he, (feeling for the skirts of

            better than they are; <persName ref="#roland_0001">Mr Roland</persName> tells you

            I only wonder you did not profit by the occasion 
            to thieve; but I suppose you were too busy with 
            your own <ecda:fauna>cocks</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>hens</ecda:fauna>, and your <ecda:fauna>pigs</ecda:fauna>, your

            now perhaps you are only come to see whether 
            the storm has not left something for you to plunder, 
            or blown something away from the stores of 
            which you may make prize. Are not you ashamed 
            that I should owe my safety to <ecda:persGroup>strangers</ecda:persGroup>? Why, 
            I suppose it would have been the same if we had 
            been attacked by <ecda:persGroup>pirates</ecda:persGroup> or <ecda:persGroup>runaway Negroes</ecda:persGroup>. 
            You would have left us to our fate; we might 
            have been robbed, murdered, and flung in the sea, 
            before you would have come to our help.</said></p>
            
            <p>This harangue was made from the steps of the 
            piazza, where <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>, heated, exhausted, 
            indignant, and enraged, gave vent to his passion in 
            thus stigmatizing the feelings of his <ecda:persGroup>slaves</ecda:persGroup> for attending 
            to their own affairs in the late emergency, 
            instead of sacrificing them to their concern for 
            his. If his figure and appearance were ludicrous 
            by the lamp light of the preceding night, they 
            were scarcely less than diverting even to his 
            <ecda:persGroup>Negroes</ecda:persGroup> by day. In feeling for the skirts of his

            dressing gown, which had now been restored to 
            him by <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the soubrette</rs>, he had discovered a woful 
            gash in his silk breeches, over which he hung 
            the fragments he had received, in the manner of 
            a petticoat. His features were disfigured with 
            perspiration, dust and dirt; and his hands, which 
            he displayed in suiting the action to the word, 
            were as black nearly as those of <ecda:persGroup>the sable gentry</ecda:persGroup> 
            he addressed. So laughable indeed was his appearance 
            altogether, that <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the brown stranger</rs> in 
            whose praise he was speaking (the person who 
            had appeared to possess an influence over his 
            comrades) could scarcely retain his gravity, in 
            spite of the more serious ideas which we may 
            suppose were fermenting in his brains, whenever
            the sinister eye of his <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">host</rs> was diverted from him 
            to the multitude he anathematized. As for the 
            rest of the chosen few who had merited the eulogy 
            of <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>, they had begun some time since 
            to effect a retreat towards the shore, on pretence 
            of examining their boat, and securing what effects 
            the sea might have spared them from it:—not 
            altogether a pretence, although there was perhaps 
            a no less important consideration which affected 
            them in thus withdrawing themselves; namely, 
            the apprehension of being suspected, recognised 
            by any of the multitude, detected, and secured. 
            Nay, one of them had overheard <rs ref="#ariel_0001" type="person">an old black 
            woman</rs>, surnamed <rs rend="#ariel_0001" type="person">the White Fairy</rs>, (because she

            <fw type="pageNum">72</fw>
            
            was as black as pitch,) muttering beneath the 
            piazza window, that her <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">master</rs> need not brag so 
            much of his new friends, who, bad as they looked, 
            ("fit only for the John-crows,") still looked better 
            than they were in reality; and, as the listener 
            seemed to wince a little on hearing her oracular 
            inuendo, she had begun to assume a bolder tone, 
            and called out for the sailor's paper, a word significative 
            of passport. The paper, sure enough, 
            had been prepared; but there was no immediate 
            occasion, according to their ideas, of submitting 
            it to inspection and scrutiny; and they judged 
            it better to remove to the sea-shore, for the purposes 
            above-mentioned. Thither they proceeded 
            without delay; leaving their <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">comrade</rs> with the 
            <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">master of the house</rs>, to answer all interrogatories, 
            and make any reconnoissance he should think 
            proper for the furthering of the scheme which was 
            the subject of their expedition.</p>
            
            <p><persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName> saw them depart, without making 
            any remark, supposing their intention to be such 
            as they represented; but as soon as his passion 
            thus vented on his <ecda:persGroup>slaves</ecda:persGroup> had in some meausure 
            abated, he began to pay a little attention to this 
            more <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">important-looking personage</rs>; of whom, 
            considering his colour, he felt authorized to ask 
            his name and lineage, at the same time that he 
            begged his acceptance of a doubloon, in testimony 
            of the services he wished to acknowledge. This

            <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the Mulatto-man</rs> decidedly renounced, as well as

            he to them; but if there were to be obligation on

            from any hiterto thought or spoken of; 
            and perhaps he might have it in his power, without 
            however claiming any acknowledgment for it,

            <p>It was in vain that <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the Mulatto</rs> protested against 
            such an honour as breakfasting in the piazza of 
            <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">the white man</rs>: his bows either were not sufficiently 
            disqualifying, or there was something in his 
            physiognomy which excited the pertinacity of the 
            buckra. At any rate, he allowed himself to be 
            prevailed on, and took his station, as desired: 
            while <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>, having given the orders he had

            company many minutes before he saw one of the 
            doors gently open, and a pair of black eyes peep 
            on him from a face, the rest of which was concealed 
            behind the door. There could be nothing 
            repulsive in his exterior; for the aforesaid eyes, as 
            far as he divined, expressed an increasing curiosity; 
            and the face, after a sufficient stare, gradually 
            elongating itself from its concealment, displayed 
            the pretty features of <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the soubrette</rs>. This 
            <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">young beauty</rs> had not failed to take notice of <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the 
            stranger</rs>'s figure and appearance the previous 
            night; and if she was pleased, or rather not displeased, 
            with them under the circumstances of 
            that time, and the calamity that attended it, there 
            was no reason why she should not indulge herself 
            with a second, a daylight perusal of them. So,
            having heard the finale of the dialogue in the 
            piazza, and her <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">young mistress</rs> being by this time 
            attired, and after having made the above-mentioned 
            observaion of the premises, she stepped fearlessly 
            out of the chamber, and shutting the door 
            behind her, beckoned with a familiar smile to the 
            stranger to follow her to the further end of the 
            piazza; where she made a halt, and turning 
            round upon him suddenly, took advantage of the 
            full glare of the daylight to examine his features 
            to her heart's content.</p>
            
            <p>We have before remarked, in mentioning the 
            picture of Schiavoni, that <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">this Mulatto</rs> was a tall,

            athletic, personable man. <persName ref="#michal_0001">Michal</persName> <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the soubrette</rs>, 
            surveying him from head to foot, was speedily 
            convinced of this; and had his skin been white 
            instead of tawny, she had taken him to be a very 
            handsome <distinct>buckra</distinct>. <ecda:persGroup>Quadroon damsels</ecda:persGroup> do not 
            look for beauty in the youth of their own colour; 
            their first ideas of admiration or love are devoted 
            to the genuine white breed, either native or imported, 
            to which they are themselves indebted, 
            as they think, for the charms of their own persons, 
            and all the favour they find in the eyes of 
            those who sigh for their affections. Therefore, 
            however natural the desire she might have to appear 
            to advantage, even before a young Mulatto-
            man, nothing was farther from her thoughts than 
            to inspire him with anything like that confidence 
            which prompted him, after he had tenderly squeezed 
            the hand unconsciously held out to him, to imprint 
            a kiss upon her lips. Nothing was more 
            unexpected, and few things had more astonished 
            her. She snatched away her hand, and tore herself 
            from his embrace as if she had been in the 
            folds of such a serpent as that which stopped 
            the march of <ecda:persGroup>the Roman army</ecda:persGroup>; and though her tongue 
            refused to express the feelings which this insult 
            had roused, her black eyes flashed with so much 
            anger and indignation, that the heart of <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the Mulatto</rs> 
            for a moment sunk within him, and he felt 
            the necessity, by looks as well as words of sup-

            plication, to apologize for the liberty he had 
            taken. There is a natural grace in the manners 
            of <ecda:persGroup>persons of colour</ecda:persGroup> (nay, even in those of <ecda:persGroup>Negroes</ecda:persGroup>;)
            so that the apology to which she listened, 
            however elegantly worded and delivered, seemed 
            only what she might have expected; but the tone 
            of voice was in no wise creole; and <persName ref="#michal_0001">Michal</persName>, as 
            she set him down in her mind for an impudent 
            fellow, concluded he had acquired his gentility 
            with his free and easy manners in other countries, 
            and in pursuit of his business, whatever it might 
            be. However, as her resentment began to abate 
            with the manifestation of his repentance, she gave 
            way to the more natural kindness of her disposition, 
            and told him with a smile, that he was no 
            <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">guest</rs> for her <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">master</rs> and <rs type="person">mistress</rs>, but must come 
            and breakfast at her house, not twenty yards from

            him plenty of coffee and <ecda:food ana="flora">roasted plantains</ecda:food>, which 
            were now waiting his pleasure. As she spoke 
            this, she descended the piazza steps; and <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the 
            Mulatto</rs>, convinced by her expression, and his own 
            reflections, that she was in the right, followed her 
            not unwillingly to the abode which she had 
            pointed out, where he was indulged with the seat 
            of honour, and regaled with an excellent breakfast: 
            while at the same time he feasted his eyes 
            with gazing on those, and the many other charms 
            of the pretty and amiable <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">soubrette</rs>.</p>

            afraid to speak to the Mulatto and Quadroon

            <p>THERE was nothing that could be called preposessing 
            in the costume of <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the Mulatto-man</rs>; which 
            consisted of a large pair of loose Osnaburgh 
            trowsers, over a pair of brown leathern boots; a 
            check shirt, buttoned up close to the neck; and a 
            waistcoat with loose sleeves, of drab-coloured 
            cloth, braided in front, and at the seams, but 
            much the worse for the service it had done. He 
            carried a Spanish sword, slung from his right 
            shoulder by a brass or copper chain, consisting of 
            oblong links, bright wth friction; and his head 
            was graced with a huge white sombrero beaver. 
            He followed his <rs ref="#guthrie_0001" type="person">host</rs> with a firm and undaunted 
            step into the piazza which he had last quitted 
            with <rs ref="#michal_0001" type="person">the Quadroon</rs>, and doffed his castor with a

            returned his salutation with a natural grace, and 
            with little effort, although her features, pale with

            grief and watching, indicated considerable agitation, 
            anxiety, and irresolution: yet still regarding 
            him only as an inferior, she scarcely examined 
            his features, and indeed paid little attention to his 
            figure; but she turned her eyes in some confusion 
            on the floor, when her father signified that the person

            would be kind enough to give her some information, 
            various reports of a most odious description 
            respecting him having found their way to 
            the country. Besides which, he had other reasons 
            to inquire particularly concerning him, as he 
            was the last in an entail that would devolve on 
            himself in the event of <persName ref="#oliver_fairfax_0001">Mr Fairfax</persName>'s death—a 
            circumstance bruited abroad, among the other 
            reports. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Now, <persName ref="#sebastian_0001">Mr Sebastian</persName>,</said> he added, <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">do

            <p>As he said this, <persName ref="#guthrie_0001">Mr Guthrie</persName>, who had used the 
            privilege of his vision during his speech of looking 
            right and left at the same time, now turned, 
            or endeavoured to turn, the gaze of both eyes on 
            <rs ref="#sebastian_0001" type="person">the Mulatto</rs>; an effort in which he succeeded 
            without being detected; as no one unacquainted 
            with him could have imagined, from the obliquity of 
            his scrutinizing glance, that it was directed where 
            it was intended. The Mulatto almost laughed 
            unconsciously, as he replied, looking steadfastly 
            at <rs ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001" type="person">the lady</rs> while he spoke, that <persName ref="#oliver_fairfax_0001">Mr Fairfax</persName> was 
            certainly alive. A half-supressed sigh escaped

            the lips of <persName ref="#joanna_guthrie_0001">Joanna</persName> at this piece of news; and her 
            face, which was previously pale as marble, assumed 
            for a moment the hue of crimson. She 
            seated herself on a sofa, as she said—venturing

            <p>He said this with a slight inclination of the

            for her rosy colour had faded faster, if possible,

            strode along the piazza and down the steps,

            consoled him with assurances of his <rs ref="#cuffy_0001" type="person">boy</rs>'s safety, 
            and the recovery of his <ecda:fauna>Spanish horse</ecda:fauna>; and how, 
            leading him higher up in the mountains, to cross 
            the swollen rivulets nearer their sources, they 
            finally introduced him at nightfall to <ecda:persGroup>the slaves</ecda:persGroup>

            at the foresaken settlement, to which he was journeying 
            on the previous night, when the storm 
            overtook him, and our history began.</p>
            
            
            <p>Behold him then, after rather a tedious journey 
            on foot, standing beside the ruins of a house 
            which had been all but destroyed by the hurricane; 
            the roof totally demolished, and the spars 
            of it scattered about the small surrounding plain, 
            part of which had formerly served as a barbicue 
            to dry the <ecda:food>coffee</ecda:food> which <ecda:anonPers>the deceased planter</ecda:anonPers> had 
            been used to cultivate. The walls were partly 
            standing, being built of stone; and within them a 
            narrow staircase of the same materials led to a 
            cellar, which he intended to visit as soon as he 
            should have had an opportunity of conversing 
            with the <hi rend="italics">Liberals</hi> whom he expected to meet on 
            this occasion. There were two gigantic palms to 
            the eastward of the building, waving their feathery 
            summits most gracefully, as the land-wind sighed 
            its spicy breath through their plumes; and their 
            long shadows seemed to float upon the whitened 
            walls whenever the shafts of these noble trees 
            traversed the rays of the moon, whose brilliant 
            orb lighted up the surrounding scenery with a 
            splendour but little inferior to that of the sun in 
            more northern climes. But for the ruined mansion 
            before him, <persName ref="#roland_0001">Mr Roland</persName>, or a spectator more 
            alive to the impressions of nature, might have 
            almost fancied this a fairy scene, if not the very

            abode of romance. It was a plain of about three 
            or four acres, like an amphitheatre, environed by 
            huge masses of perpendicular rocks crowned with 
            the everlasting forest of the island, and watered 
            by a considerable rivulet which tumbled from 
            among them, and after flowing nearly round their 
            bases, precipitated itself into a deep ravine, so 
            clothed with the rank foliage of the overhanging 
            trees, that even by daylight its further course 
            could hardly be discriminated. There were many 
            other little rills produced by the late rains, some 
            of which seemed as it were to leap from their 
            rocky precipices into the streams below, whilst 
            others murmured unseen beneath or behind the 
            fragments which their temporary currents had 
            heaped in the courses through which they disembogued 
            themselves. The air was filled with 
            these accumulated and soothing sounds, so moderated 
            by the night-wind, that they ought to have 
            inspired in a more virtuous bosom none but the 
            most pleasing recollections or ideas; feelings 
            sacred perhaps to melancholy, but in no wise at 
            war with humanity.</p>
            
            <p>So thought, so felt, <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs>; but he 
            quickly reassured himself by calling to mind the 
            purpose for which he had travelled to this sequestered 
            spot. Meanwhile <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah man</rs> was 
            employed in clearing a passage to the cellar 
            among the dismantled fragments which encum-

            bered the floor of the house; and <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName>, who 
            had been for some time assisting him, while 
            <persName ref="#roland_0001">Roland</persName> was thus musing to little purpose, began 
            to hack the fallen spars and rafters with a bill-
            hook, which he had brought with him to cut 
            them into junks for making a fire; when their 
            ears were saluted with a whistle, which rang round 
            the amphitheatre with such an echo, in spite of 
            the waterfalls, that it was impossible to tell from 
            what particular spot it emanated. However, 
            <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName> replied to it, as soon as the echoes had 
            died away, by four distinct repetitions of the 
            same sound, waiting at every interval, that the 
            listeners might be enabled to discriminate the 
            number beyond the possibility of mistake. The 
            fourth was replied to by a fifth from the unseen 
            tenant of the wilderness; and a sixth, from <rs ref="#combah_0001" type="person">the 
            sable monarch elect</rs>, appeared to rouse the very 
            rocks to language; for a score of voices, as it 
            seemed, shouted in all directions to answer it, as 
            clamorous as the yell of demons might be supposed, 
            and scarcely less startling to the ears and 
            nerves of <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs>. <said rend="quotes" direct="false">This,</said> thought he, 
            <said rend="quotes" direct="false">is not my signal.</said> But the voices shouted

            <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Brutchie, Brutchie,</said> as the watchword, was 
            reverberated from mouth to mouth, as well as from

            <p><persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName> had indeed been no less in his own 
            country; as a token of which, the skin of his 
            forehead had been torn off in his youth, from the 
            setting-on of his woolly hair to within a narrow 
            space of his eye-brows, over which the edge of 
            the skin which had been so mutilated, obtruded 
            itself a little; sufficiently, by darkening the expression 
            of his eyes, to give hiim countenance a 
            character of additional ghastliness, in the opinion 
            of some of <ecda:persGroup>the Whites</ecda:persGroup>: otherwise, he had regular 
            and not unhandsome features. He received his 
            new subjects, who were to swear allegiance to 
            him, with a fine affection of royalty; and bid 
            them go down into the cellar, to his friend who 
            was busy there making a fire. But he presently 
            called one of them back by name; and stepping 
            a pace or two from <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs>, bid him take 
            a hoe and a calabash, and fill the latter with some 
            dirt from the grave of a child which his late 
            master had buried about eighteen months ago. 
            This command was intended to be a secret from 
            <persName ref="#roland_0001">Roland</persName>; but he, having had more than one misgiving 
            regarding his personal safety, was too 
            much on the alert to allow any sound to escape 
            him, which his senses could by possibility arrive 
            at. He held his breath, strained forward his

            neck, opened his mouth, and tried to swallow 
            every whisper of <rs ref="#combah_0001" type="person">the monarch</rs>'s speech; but as he 
            heard it only in part, the words <hi rend="quotes">hoe</hi> and <hi rend="quotes">grave</hi> 
            were all he could distinguish. They were, however, 
            more than sufficient to renew his alarm; 
            fearing that some scheme was to be played off on 
            him, if he should prove refractory with <rs ref="#hamel_0001" type="person">the Obeah 
            man</rs>, whose magic rites he had predetermined to 
            denounce publicly, should he see anything which 
            in his ideas militated against his duty to his 
            God, or the rights of the Christain religion. Thus 
            shrinking within himself at the mention of the 
            word <hi rend="quotes">grave,</hi> which he fancied could only be intended 
            for himself, he called his majesty to him, 
            as a pope's legate in ancient days would have 
            summoned a sovereign of <placeName ref="#europe">Europe</placeName>; and assuming 
            a courage which he had not, would have told him 
            that his plans were wicked, and that he was forsaken 
            by the angels of heaven. But the monarch 
            put his finger on <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the preacher</rs>'s lips, and himself 
            burst into a loud laugh as if to drown the words 
            and feelings which oppressed the other for want 
            of utterance. Still <rs ref="#roland_0001" type="person">the Missionary</rs> was obstinate; 
            and it required some assurance on the part of 
            <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName>, to prevent him quitting the assembly, 
            which began to increase—Negroes pouring in 
            from all quarters of this strange amphitheatre; 
            some from the path which <persName ref="#cuffy_0001">Cuffy</persName> had taken,

            grown weary of so odious a name. It might have 
            been fancied at last that this was almost literally 
            the case; for the voices and the echoes at length 
            subsiding, silence was gradually restored, with 
            the expectations of the audience, until for a time 
            no sound was heard but that of the waterfalls, 
            and the waving of the trees; every mind being 
            as it were bound up in suspense, and every ear 
            impatient to receive the glad tidings which the 
            spiritual comforter had promised. The moon 
            shed a flood of light on his dark figure, and on 
            the darker one of <persName ref="#combah_0001">Combah</persName>, who stood at his 
            elbow, and whom the addition of a pair of horns 
            would have qualified for the personification of the 
            fiend so frequently represented by the painters of 
            yore as attendant tempter on holy monks and

            while he leaned against the broken wall for support, 
            the Brutchie having taken charge of his 
            hat; and when this had been followed by audible 
            prayers, also usual with the orthodox, he spread 
            open his arms, and began as follows.</p>

            gion, of which you may all become members, 
            acknowledges no such distinction as that of master 
            and slave: it makes all men equal; I say, it makes 
            all men equal, all brothers.</said> This piece of information 
            was received with murmurs of approbation, 
            augmenting at last into a general hurrah which 
            lasted several minutes, so as to have drowned the 
            language of the preacher, had he not paused. It 
            gave almost universal satisfaction, the black gentleman 
            at Roland's elbow being the only individual 
            dissentient; and he with some reason, as it 
            disqualified him in one word for the office and the 
            rights of king. He pulled the preacher gently 
            by the flap of his coat, during the tumult of congratulations 
            below, and reminded him of his private 
            and royal necessities. But Roland bid him fear 
            nothing; and as soon as silence was again secured, 
            resumed his oratory aloud.</p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Brethren, you know the white peopel well. 
            They brought you or your fathers from Africa; 
            they <hi rend="italics">bought</hi> you, they say; which means, they 
            hired people to steal you and bring you on board 
            their ships. They brought you here, and made 
            you work, and flogged you. Then they took your 
            wives and your daughters for their mistresses, to 
            live with them; and you know they flog <hi rend="italics">them</hi>, if 
            they like. Now these white men call themselves 
            Christians; but they are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> Christians; they are 
            more heathens than any of your ancestors were,

            as some of you have before heard from myself and 
            other zealous men, who come here to show you 
            your rights. You will perhaps say I am a white 
            man. So I am outwardly—my skin is white; 
            but my heart is like yours; and if that is black 
            as your skins, so is mine. I am an exception to 
            the white men; I have never flogged you, nor ravished 
            your daughters.</said> Here a loud demoniac 
            sort of laugh was heard from the cellar below, 
            where, as Roland at the sound recollected, his 
            Obeah rival was at work. However he continued 
            his speech; for the moonlight could not betray 
            the expression pourtrayed on his writhing features, 
            except to his own mind's eye; yet he faultered 
            out again the words <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">ravished your daughters. 
            Let me tell you,</said> he continued, <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">how the first 
            people calling themselves Christians treated the 
            inhabitants of this island, when they conquered 
            it. They said that they had a right from heaven 
            to burn them, if they would not be true Christians; 
            and I have told you that true Christianity makes 
            all men equal; that is, it does away at once with 
            slavery. They burned them, they hung them, 
            they cut their throats, they strangled them, they 
            hunted them with dogs, until they killed them 
            every one. There is not one of their descendants 
            now alive, not one. Those conquerors knew it 
            was impossible to trust people who had it in their 
            power to revenge themselves. Need I repeat

            that? I do not say that the white people here 
            will serve <hi rend="italics">you</hi> so: no—but had you all come with 
            them when they first conquered the country, they 
            would have made you do all this for them: yes, 
            they would have put swords and guns in your 
            hands, and told you to fire upon and to stab those 
            who were masaters of the lands; they would have 
            told you to show no mercy, to spare nobody, to 
            drive the men into the sea or fling them down 
            the precipices, and to destroy them every one, that 
            they and you might have the houses and the 
            lands, and their daughters and wives, for themselves 
            and yourselves, without any fear of their being 
            taken away from you: for if any of the people had 
            been left alive, they might ahve risen again and 
            overpowered you, or got men to come from other 
            countries to fight for them and conquer you 
            again; when they would have killed you every 
            one without mercy. But if you had left nobody 
            alive except your friends; I say, except your 
            friends, those who toil for you, sweat for you, 
            travel for you, all to save your souls from damnation,—
            you would have been perfectly safe; 
            you, and your sons, and your grandsons, from 
            generation to generation. Now my friends and 
            breathren, there are many of you who are true 
            Christians; and such you may all become, if you 
            will—</said></p>

            below. This cellar was immediately underneath 
            the preacher, who, except his royal companion, 
            was perhaps the only person near enough to distinguish 
            accurately the stray words which from 
            time to time escaped to the upper air. Combah 
            looked down in a little alarm; and the preacher 
            muttered <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Perdition!</said> as  he resumed. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">The 
            white people here are none of them true Christians, 
            because they believe in slavery; and there is no 
            such thing as slavery in the religion which i profess. 
            You know tha the white people in England 
            want to make you free: there are many true believers 
            there; one of them, a great man, rich, adn 
            a lord, says that the white men here are receivers 
            of stolen goods, or inheritors, which is the same 
            thing: he means that <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are the stolen goods.
            Now, he is a fine, great, wise, brave, man: one of 
            his ancestors helped to conquer England itself a 
            long, long time ago; and got for his share four 
            great parishes in one county, with all the slaves 
            upon it, who were called villains; and another of 
            his ancestors went round the world in a ship, and 
            beat the Spaniards in America, and stole all their 
            money, almost a million of dollars; more than 
            you can count; besides silks, and satins, and 
            musks, and all sorts of things. He came upon 
            them unawares, and killed a great many of them. 
            So you see he too was a great brave man; and he 
            has had many more rich and great ancestors and

            relations, whose money he has inherited, besides 
            all this; and he has lands and slaves—no, not 
            slaves, poor men—to work for them and for him, in 
            England and Ireland. He gives them no clothes, 
            and nothing to eat; but he is a great, wise man, 
            and very religious and virtuous; and what he says 
            must in this instance be as true as the Gospel 
            itself.</said></p>

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">What is the use of your masters giving you 
            houses, and clothes, and fish, and grounds to cultivate? 
            It is that you may work for them. Why 
            do you tell me that your mistresses attend to you 
            in sickness and old age; that they are kind to 
            you and your children? Pshaw! it is that you 
            may slave for them, and that the children may 
            take heart, and hope to pass <hi rend="italics">their</hi> old age in the 
            same way. But remember what I said about 
            slavery and true Christianity; if you will be true 
            Christians, you cannot be slaves. Slaves! Did 
            not those of St Domingo make themselves free? 
            <hi rend="italics">They</hi> were brave men: they had white wives 
            when they were free; for they lvoed their mistresses, 
            and shed only the blood of their oppressors. 
            But if you were free, as the English nation 
            wants to make you—remember—choose your own 
            schoolmasters and preachesrs; do not let them 
            send you parsons and bishops to enslave your 
            very hearts, to eat you and drink you, and make 
            you work for them, for fear of the Devil. No;

            think of those who have taught you relgion, as 
            I have done; who have laboured night and day 
            to instruct you; who have pointed out to you the 
            road to freedom; who have saved you from hell. 
            Do you know that in England every man works 
            one day in the week for a parson, who is as wicked 
            as your masters? and every man pays his corn, 
            and his milk, and his fruit, and his vegetables, his 
            honey, and his pigs and calves, to him? And 
            these parsons are among the people who want to 
            keep you slaves; you must hear only missionaries. 
            The parsons will not let anybody there 
            speak against them; not a word: they catch 
            them up, and put them in teh stocks and in gaol 
            for two or three years or more. You had better 
            remain as you are, than have such as these for 
            your masters. You have a right to be free; but 
            still remember the light I have shewn you, the 
            true religion. If you forsake your God, he will 
            foresake you; and hell has room for millions yet 
            unborn, your children and your children's children; 
            do not entail an everlasting curse on them! 
            Beware of the fire which is not quenched; beware—
            beware!</said></p>
            
            <p>The Missionary was here startled and confounded, 
            as well as interrupted in his unaccountable 
            career, by and explosion in the vault below; 
            the smoke of which, finding its way to his nostrils 
            and those of the Brutchie, caused the last

            to shift his quarters, and the first to jump headlong 
            down. He could not spring towards the 
            multitude who stood with their mouths open 
            devouring his discourse, for they occupied all 
            the spare place as far as the ruins of the walls 
            and beams would allow. To the outside of the 
            ruin consequently he was obliged to turn about, 
            and spring down in to the area of the building, 
            where, as fortune had ordained, his weight broke 
            through the rotten boards that had formed the 
            floor of the hall, and he fell, amidst the cockroaches 
            and rubbish which he carried with him, 
            into the vault below, in which Hamel and a chosen 
            few were celebrating some orgies of a very 
            different nature from those which constituted the 
            externals of Roland's faith. Meanwhile, his sudden 
            disappearance from above disconcerted some 
            of his audience, as it did not fail to amuse others, 
            who would have compared this his exit with that 
            of Empedocles, had they ever heard of him or 
            of mount Etna; or with the secession of Lycurgus, 
            after he had favoured the Spartans with his 
            very moral and salutary laws, not inferior in interest 
            or humanity to the doctrine they had just 
            heard. But knowing nothing of these ancient 
            worthies, their admiration was limited to the 
            descent, unexpected and unaccountable except 
            to those who were near enough to smell the smoke 
            and witness the accident of this modern apostle,

            who found anything but a welcome among the 
            crew which his evil genius had thus doomed him 
            to encounter in the cellar. As soon as he had a 
            little recovered from teh confusion caused by his 
            downfall, he heard exclamations of <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Turn him 
            out—fool—mule—what does he want here?</said>—
            and Brutchie was appealed to from below, to come 
            and take away his preaching man. The consternation 
            of Roland was not inferior to the indignation 
            of those he had disturbed; for he found 
            himself among a dozen or more of wild-looking 
            negroes, most of them naked to the waist; or if 
            they had garments, they were more or less stained 
            with blood. There was likewise a human skull 
            on a table in the midst of them, filled with earth; 
            and a calabash, containing a filthy-looking mixture, 
            placed beside a small iron pot which flamed with 
            burning rum, whose blue and ghastly light, sufficient 
            to illuminate the cellar, cast a glare of deeper 
            hideousness on the faces and persons of these 
            practitioners. A cow's horn tipped with brass, in 
            all probablility once the magazine of a rifleman, 
            promised to hold more of the compound which 
            had caused the explosion, as it had not received 
            any damage; and although the cellar was still 
            reeking with smoke, the combustion had not been 
            of any importance, except that it had brought 
            down to them this troublesome and unwelcome 
            guest.</p>

            <p>Roland remained in some confusion, while all 
            eyes were turned on him, fancying that Combah 
            had thus betrayed him; for which his imagination 
            quickly apprehended a sufficient cause in 
            his having preached, or rather harangued, solely 
            for himself, omitting to mention Mr Brutchie, 
            much less to recommend him as a monarch to 
            the assembled multitude, who had heard from 
            him only a doctrine of equality and republican 
            emancipation. Meanwhile the company still 
            glared on him, now in silence; and he heard with 
            additional alarm his friend Combah above, dismissing 
            the crowd from before the house, and 
            telling them to dance and be happy, for there 
            was plenty of rum, and women, and music; and 
            they had only to enjoy themselves for an hour, 
            while he went to talk with the Missionary, who 
            was gone down to eat some supper below. They 
            gave the chief a hurrah, and withdrew farther 
            into the arena, as he desired.</p>

            the forbidden ceremonies about to be 
            transacted below. The dancing and other diversions, 
            although discountenanced, if not interdicted, 
            by the legislature of the island and the 
            proprietors of the adjoining lands, would not subject 
            the partakers or the spectators of the performance 
            to anythign beyond a simple flagellation; 
            but the celebration of Obeah rights, or 
            the circumstance of being present at such celebration

            of it, would render all concerned in or about it 
            liable to a much heavier punishment, banishment 
            or death. To prevent such discovery, half a 
            dozen Negroes were stationed about the ruins, 
            with orders to let no one approach the building 
            before due notice was given to those engaged in 
            it. These were some of the initiated, persons 
            who had already taken an oath which, like that 
            of the Eleusinian mysteries, they dared not reveal, 
            on pain of being instantly assassinated by their 
            comrades, besideds the curse which they would 
            entail on themselves and their posterity by such 
            a backsliding.</p>
            
            <p>Combah felt a perfect security in thus disposing 
            them; and having heard the eboe drum strike 
            up in the arena, and seen the black fairies begin 
            to flit about in the moonlight, he descended to 
            the cellar, where all rose to receive him from the 
            floor on which they were seated round the low 
            table furnished with the materials before enumerated; 
            Roland standing in the midst of them, 
            sweating with heat, fright, and horror. They 
            made an opening for  him to enter the circle, then 
            re-seated themselves, all except Hamel, who 
            asked of Brutchie what was to be done with Roland. 
            The king told him without hesitation that 
            the Missionary had not kept his word; for that 
            he had promised to make the people believe him 
            to be sent by heaven for their king,—he had

            engaged to anoint his head with holy coco-nut 
            oil, to put a crown upon it, and then to cry out 
            <said rend="quotes" direct="false">Long live Combah, king fo Jamaica!</said> as he 
            said the white people did yonder on the other 
            side of the water: after which he was to have 
            persuaded all the Negroes to come and kiss his 
            (Combah's) right hand, and swear to obey him, 
            and follow him to war upon the Whites all over 
            the island. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Now, master Missionary,</said> he continued, 
            <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">why have you only spoken for yourself? 
            And waht is worse, why have you preached that 
            the Negroes are all to be free alike, and have no 
            king to lead them to fight or make laws to keep 
            them in order? Master Missionary! the Negroes 
            must work, some of them, or how are they to live? 
            you do not preach like a wise man: you tell the 
            Negroes only to kill the white people.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">No, no,</said> cried the other, interrupting him: 
            <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">God forbid that I should ever counsel them to

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">So wicked!</said> replied Combah: <said rend="quotes" aloud="true"> so wicked? 
            Why, what else did you mean? Hamel, Cudjoe, 
            Caesar, Jupiter, Pluto, and you, all of you,—did 
            you not hear what master Roland said? Did not 
            he tell the Negroes to kill the white men, to take 
            their wives and daughters, and to make him 
            schoolmaster, parson, adn bishop fo the island?</said></p>

            I put my trust, and not in you, nor in your religion, 
            nor in any of those who belong to it. There 
            is no truth nor reality in you, for what you promise 
            to day you are afraid of tomorrow; and you 
            want only to set the people of the island fighting 
            and quarrelling, that you may get their money 
            and some of the white women for your share. 
            These men are ready to swear that they will never 
            forsake me, nor flinch from killing the Whites; 
            and I to swear I will never forsake them, and 
            while I live never cease to revenge the death of 
            any one of them a hundred-fold, if he dies by the 
            hands of the Whites, until there shall not be a 
            white man left in teh island. Come, Hamel, let

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Oh no, for mercy's sake!</said> exclaimed the 
            terrified Missionary, <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">let me not be a witness 
            to anything so horrible; spare me the sight of 
            such atrocities, which your religion may justify,

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">You are premature.</said> answered Combah. 
            <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">What atrocities do you speak of? What have 
            you seen or done? We are speaking of an oath: 
            our ceremonies are awful, but not atrocious. 
            There have been some who shed the blood of a 
            child to swear by, and cared not that the infant

            but we shed only our own. But, Roland, you 
            must also take the oath, or—.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Or what?</said> cried the trembling Missionary.</p>

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Is it not so?</said> continued the king, looking 
            round him. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">You have witnessed the rights of 
            Obeah, the mysteries of the enslaved Coromantins: 
            you must swear to keep them inviolate.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">I swear—I swear,</said> said the Missionary; <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">on

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Aye,</said> replied the Brutchie; <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">but you must 
            swear as we do. You have violated the sanctuary 
            of the Obeah man; you have visited his dwelling; 
            you volunteered to preach to these runaways 
            above, and to all the slaves, that they were free 
            from the power of the Whites, and that I was their 
            king.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">I will still do so,</said> cried Roland, <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">put me to

            one, and swear that you are sanctified by heaven 
            to be their king.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">You are right, master Roland,</said> replied the 
            king: <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">you shall do all this; and had you done 
            it, you had before now departed in peace. You 
            must swear to do it, and swear by your God,

            <fw type="pageNum">124</fw>
            
            which is ours, to keep our oaths and our secrets; 
            and you must swear as we do. Look at this

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">I swear—I swear by my God! Let that

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">No!</said> replied a voice from the circle; <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">he is 
            not afraid to swear by his God; he will not keep 
            that oath: he must take the skull in his hand.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Why,</said> exclaimed another, <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">do you trifle 
            with this foolish man? If you cannot trust him, 
            let us dig his grave—bury him. What does he 
            here? and what do we want with white preachers, 
            or with white men at all? Master Brutchie, 
            he will certainly betray us, if he goes alive from 
            here: we only waste time and words; make him 
            take the oath, or I am ready to kill him on the 
            spot.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">What is there then in the oath,</said> said Combah,

            that I shall sell my soul, and yet shall be unrewarded 
            with her love. I say to you, Brutchie— 
            Combah—I came here by accident; I sought not 
            to penetrate your mysteries; I was wrong, I was 
            unfortunate; I will do anything but this;—Oh, 
            stay that cruel man's hadn! kill me not; let me 
            not be murdered, Combah! I will do all; I will 
            swear anything; what—how—you please.</said></p>
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">125</fw>
            
            <p>The Missionary was on the ground, thrown 
            down by the unfeeling Negro who had offered to 
            kill him, and who now stood over him with a 
            sharpened billhook in his hand, ready to hew him 
            to death. The blue flames of the only light by 
            which the fault was illuminated, exhibited the 
            horrid passion of the assassin in colours still more 
            frightful than those with which nature had depicted 
            it. He was of the race called Mocos, a 
            people known on some occasions to be cannibals, 
            who file their teeth so as to make them resemble 
            those of a cat, and render them narrow and sharp 
            as needles. He gnashed these in the face of his 
            shuddering suppliant; and his brawny arm was 
            already raised to strike, when Combah arrested 
            it, and bid him let the Missionary take the oath. 
            Upon this, the skull was handed to him by Hamel; 
            and he repeated without delay the words dictated 
            to him; imprecating curses on his own head, that 
            it might speedily become like that which he held 
            in his hand, filled with dirt, if he ever mentioned 
            to any man, woman, or child, of any colour, what 
            he had seen this night, or at any other time, of 
            Obeah. The skull was then deposited again on 
            the table; and Hamel, taking the calabash containing, 
            as was related, a filthy-looking mixture, 
            held it close to the Missionary's face, and bid him 
            see that it was blood—blood drawn from their 
            own veins, and mixed with gunpowder and with 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">126</fw>
            
            the grave-dirt of the skull. He dipped his finger 
            in the mess, and crossed the face and breast 
            of Roland; finally holding it to his lips, and 
            commanding him to taste and swallow a portion, 
            and then to say after him as follows: —<said rend="quotes" aloud="true">If I lie, 
            if I am treacherous, if I mean to deceive in any 
            way those whose blood I have tasted, may the 
            grave-dirt make my heart rot, till it bursts and 
            tumbles out before my face! May I die, and never 
            awake in the grave, or awake to everlasting pain 
            and torment, and become the slave of the white 
            man's devil for ever and ever!</said> Having repeated 
            this, the mixture was again put to his lips: he 
            tasted it, and sunk to the ground in an agony 
            created by his horror and disgust.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, the dancing and festivity were 
            carried on above with an increasing energy, as 
            the rum inspired the minds and accelerated the 
            motions of the performers. A calabash of it was 
            handed to the Missionary below; and he learnt 
            from Combah; that his being a Christian alone 
            excused him from having been obliged to contribute 
            some of his own blood to teh execrable mess 
            which he had tasted; that the same indulgence 
            had been granted to himself, (for Roland had 
            formerly christened him;) and that he too had 
            taken the oath, and had been followed by all the 
            others, while the Missionary lay in a state of insensibility. 
            Combah added, that now, if he were 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">127</fw>
            
            willing, Roland should tell the multitude that 
            they must have a king, and that as they knew 
            him (Combah) to have been a prince in his own 
            country, there was none more worthy to be called 
            so than himself.</p>
            
            <p>The Missionary groaned with horror, but dared 
            not hesitate; yet, as he arose from teh earth, his 
            mind was again convulsed with the recollection 
            of what he had seen and done, and with the conviction 
            of what he had yet to go through, in 
            recommending and anointing as a delegate from 
            heaven, and as a monarch, one whom he found to 
            be an apostate from the faith which he had once 
            sworn to maintain; one linked with dealers in 
            necromancy, bound together by oaths of a nature 
            so diabolical, as to bar all communion, all possibility 
            of amalgamation, with Christian society; 
            one, in short, at whose conduct even the miserable 
            conscience of the Missionary revolted, after 
            all his political aversions to any farther intercourse 
            with him had been silenced, as they were, 
            only by necessity, compulsion, and the fear of 
            immediate death. Yet Combah had promised 
            him not only his assistance, but his whole power, 
            all the influence he should acquire, to get possession 
            of the beautiful and unsuspecting girl, 
            against whose peace he had practised; the gentle, 
            the amiable Joanna. Nothing less than a revolution, 
            he felt assured, could make him master of 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">128</fw>
            
            her person; and this revolution he could only 
            effect, as he thought, by means similary at least to 
            those he had already employed in perverting the 
            minds of the Negroes. Combah had been his 
            friend, his favourite, his disciple; and until he 
            found him in the cave of the Obeah man, his heart 
            had been set on making him a sovereign, for his 
            own purposes. But by seeing him with that 
            mystical personage, his suspicions and apprehensions 
            were influenced to a degree bordering almost 
            on frenzy. He felt that Hamel was his rival; 
            and from the knowledge which he appeared to 
            possess, and which must make a greater impression 
            on the minds of the Negroes than on his own, 
            he felt that his rival was a formidable one. Indeed 
            it was but too evident, that Hamel had 
            introduced the Brutchie to him in his cave, to 
            disconcert the hopes of the Missionary, and display 
            his own pre-eminence; for he might have 
            allowed him to depart unknown, unseen, as he 
            had come, betrayed to the wizard solely by his 
            conch, for which the latter might have accounted 
            to Roland as he pleased, or not at all. But Hamel, 
            already jealous of the Christian's influence, 
            and well acquainted with some particulars of his 
            life, contrived to impress his enemy with even a 
            superior notion of his own capability, and rendered 
            him almost contemptible in the eyes of Combah. 
            This was a triumph too dear to the Obeah man, 
            
            <pb/>
            <fw type="pageNum">129</fw>
            
            to be renounced or trifled with: he had acquired, 
            and hoped to retain, all the influence he could 
            desire over the mind of the Brutchie. The Missionary 
            he could have destroyed in his cave; but 
            Roland might be made to serve his purposes. 
            There was a pride, an additional triumph, which 
            he contemplated, in enslaving a white man, the 
            enslaver of free men's minds; of making a Christain 
            preacher, this man whom the Negroes worshipped, 
            and the white men deprecated for the 
            influence he had obtained, work for him; of 
            bending the very soul of the apostle, as he called 
            himself, to his own service, to do his drudgery, 
            to dictate to teh credulous Negroes what he 
            should, by his invisible means, compel him to 
            dictate; and then to sink this very man to the 
            lowest possible degradation of human nature; to 
            make him participate in rites and ceremonies 
            which he loathed, abhorred, and execrated; to 
            damn his very soul, in his own estimation, by 
            submission to such participation; and for what? 
            To save his vile ignoble carcass from the grave, 
            to writhe a little longer beneath <hi rend="italics">his</hi> lash, to crawl 
            under a heavier load of years and cares: <said rend="quotes" aloud="false">his 
            soul disdained him for so mean a thought.</said></p>
            
            <p>It was Hamel, in fact, who had first put the 
            Brutchie upon the scheme of compromising with 
            Roland for the delivery of Joanna. When he 
            discovered his information to the Missionary in

            his cave, it was not a mere affectation. The influence 
            of the Obeah man was not limited: he 
            possessed knowledge—the secrets of all ranks, and 
            of all sorts of transactions; he knew of Roland's 
            passion and practices, and he taught the Brutchie 
            how to profit by his rival's weaknesses. But we 
            have seen that Combah had himself intentions 
            with respect to the person of Joanna: even <hi rend="italics">he</hi> 
            was indisposed to keep his faith, where a woman, 
            a beautiful woman, was concerned; and he meant, 
            it seems, to disappoint the hopes of his pious 
            minister on this his fondest, his tenderest expectation. 
            His scheme had been detailed only to the 
            worthies who had passed the previous night at 
            Mr Guthrie's; and he might have had his reasons 
            for assigning such an intention respecting her as 
            that which we have related. Hamel had his suspicions 
            of it, however, and was fully bent on 
            thwarting it, if such should appear to be the 
            Brutchie's real intention: nay, he had hopes of 
            securing the young lady himself, (though for 
            what purpose it might be improper here to explain,) 
            in the event of a revolt which should effect 
            any permanent revolution. On such a revolution 
            his own soul was bent: his arts, his influence, 
            his every energy, were devoted to the extermination 
            of the Whites, or to their expulsion from the 
            island. It is not enough to say he detested 
            them: his hatred was charged with the recollec-

            tion of the outrages he had himself endured. 
            An African, torn from his country, chained, 
            trampled on, herded with the rabble of his own 
            and other nations, sold to a black tyrant—black 
            as himself—compelled to work in irons, and 
            whipped into desperation by his brutal master; 
            his vengeance was yet directed against the Whites 
            who had enslaved and thus degraded him; for 
            he had found means long since to revenge himself, 
            though without taking his life, on the sable 
            tyrant who had purchased him from the ship 
            in which he had been imported; free Negroes 
            having the same right to buy slaves as that 
            claimed by the Europeans themselves. He had, 
            in fact, become the property of this black master, 
            having shewn so daring a spirit on his arrival, 
            that no white merchant would be concerned 
            with him; and he had fallen in consequence, at 
            a very low price, to the lot of one who had not 
            the white man's plea of superiority to boast as an 
            argument for more exalted rights. But for this 
            purchaser, he woudld have gone to teh Spanish 
            mines.</p>

            <p>It may be supposed that the wretchedness of 
            Roland's mind and person, the latter disfigured 
            with the dirt in which he had been rolled, excited 
            little sympathy in the bosoms of his negro 
            associates in the horrible ceremony detailed in 
            the last chapter. Yet Hamel, who had still farther 
            designs on him, affected a kind of condolence, 
            wiped his clothes officiously, and assured him he 
            knew that he (the Missionary) meant to have 
            urged the propriety of Combah being publicly 
            acknowledged by the multitude as their king, if 
            he had not been prevented by the accident which 
            had thus hurried him so unintentionally and unexpectedly 
            into the cellar where those only who did

            while Roland shrunk from the appellation, and 
            the touch which accompanied it,—<said rend="quotes" aloud="true">you know, 
            brother, all men are not of one mind: there are 
            more religions than one; and ours at least has 
            teh advantage of yours in being older. For I 
            remember a white man telling me in my own 
            country, in Coromantin,—a good man, but not a 
            Christian,—that my religion was as old as the 
            deluge, when people worshipped serpents. But 
            you, none of you know anything of it; <hi rend="italics">you</hi> only 
            have seen and taken our oath, an oath which 
            makes us brothers; would it not have been the 
            same, if we had taken your oath?</said> The Obeah 
            man said this, feeling the compunction and disgust 
            which his languaged and his grasp produced 
            in his hearer. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">We call you brother from your

            those initiated in <hi rend="italics">yours</hi>. You called the mob of 
            Negroes dancing yonder, half or more of them 
            drunk, almost brutal idiots, engaged in sensualities 
            solely, without mind, spirit, worth, courage, 
            or dicrestion—brothers; you said <hi rend="quotes">brethren</hi> to 
            them, and told them that your religion made you 
            all alike. That is the best part of your religion; 
            but as I could not deserve the title by the means 
            you have recommended to them, I have reason to 
            rejoice at having had an opportunity of calling 
            myself your brother, from a cause unconnected

            with that which binds you to the drunken and 
            dancing rabble yonder. Come, master Roland, 
            from this nasty place; come with me up the 
            stairs of the cellar. Let us breathe the sweet 
            air, and see what more we are to do with these 
            people before they have drowned the rest of their 
            reason. They know me not; or if they distinguish 
            me with you, they will take me for your 
            convert; will they not, Roland? They will 
            know nothing of your supper. There is Brutchie 
            has leaped through the hole you made in your 
            descent—he has <hi rend="italics">as</hi>cended by it. This should be 
            a good omen to you, as you wihtout intending it 
            have found him, made him, a way to mount at 
            once above the heads of his countrymen, while 
            they are waiting to follow one another up the 
            steps in succession. You made this observation, 
            brother Roland? I know that nothing is lost to 
            the wise man.But shall you be the last to ascend 
            the stairs in the rear of all yoru new brethren?—
            No; let me at least imitate the meekness 
            of your example; I will follow you—I will be

            <p>Roland, staggering with heat and exhaustion, 
            and the fatigues he had endured in his terrible 
            ordeal, mounted the steps with a beating heart, 
            cursing his folly, treachery, cruelty, and all the 
            bad passions which had swayed him to this, as he 
            now fancied it, mad enterprise. Yet he was fully

            sensible to the insulting irony of the Obeah man's 
            conversation; and in spite of his oath, which had 
            indeed been crammed down his throat, he would 
            have denounced the leader and his crew, in his 
            fever of rage, had he possessed the present means; 
            or stabbed the wizard to the heart, if he could 
            have done so without a certainty of discovery and 
            punishment. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Call me not brother,</said> he said;

            it.</said> (The Missionary's fingers were convulsed, 
            and his heart knocked against his ribs.) <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">It 
            was killed by mistake; yet the hand that smote

            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Peace—peace!</said> sighed the Missionary, in a 
            stifled and half-murmured tone, fearing to be 
            overheard; <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">in the name of your God, be silent.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Of my God!</said> said the Obeah man. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">I have

            your friends are gone among them, to set their 
            minds at rest on many points. I shall still wait 
            here, and watch the stars a little longer. Do 
            you as you like: your Missionary will say all you 
            please.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="false">Ah!</said> thought the Missionary, as he turned 
            from him; <said rend="quotes" aloud="false">I had not calculated on what has 
            happened. These fiends in human shape are not 
            the fools I took them for. I reckoned indeed on 
            bewildering the minds of my hearers, and of reserving 
            the power I should acquire to make my 
            own terms with Combah. I have outwitted myself, 
            and been still more outwitted by that juggling 
            and treacherous Hamel; and so degraded am I, 
            that if they but tell my story here among this 
            crew, I am undone for ever, even with them. 
            And of what value shall I be to Combah? Yet—
            yet,</said> (and he ground his teeth together, as the 
            idea burned through his mind) <said rend="quotes" aloud="false">I may have vengeance. 
            Thanks to the white man's laws, these 
            wretches cannot give evidence against me; nay, 
            could they, whou shall believe them? I have 
            trusted no white man, woman, or child; my dearest 
            victim knows me not still, and she yet thinks 
            me what I seem to these. I can denounce them, 
            and spurn their execrable oath; and then—what 
            am I? How shall I gain Joanna? Must I see 
            her the wife of another? And must I for ever be 
            the slave of those who refused to send me here?

            Must I do thier work, to gain their approbation?—
            A set of hypocrites!</said>—</p>
            
            <p>But here his reverie was interrupted by his 
            companion Combah inquiring if he was still able 
            to address the Negroes a second time, according 
            to his promise; and if he would argue them into 
            a belief that they must have a king. <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">For they 
            are already so disposed,</said> said he; <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">you heard 
            them call me Brutchie. They have kings in their 
            own country; and they will be nothing without a 
            king.</said></p>
            
            <p><said rend="quotes" aloud="true">Combah</said> replied the Missionary in a melancholy 
            tone, <said rend="quotes" aloud="true">you have ruined and undone me. I 
            must do what you expect of me, what I have promised; 
            though I think it better that you should 
            put off, till the next Saturday night, the business 
            of placing a crown upon your head. Besides, 
            they do not crown their kings in their onw 
            country; and after the indignities I have endured, 
            my strength fails me. Yet if it must be so, let 
            the drum be stopped, and that profane dancing; 
            and call the attention of those who can attend. 
            But I will mount no more upon that ruined building; 
            let us walk into the midst.</said></p>
            
            <p>A shout from Combah awakened the curiosity 
            of the multitude, and a second silenced the drum. 
            The word Brutchie, again bawled and howled 
            around in acknowledgment, and in token of respect, 
            produced an effect like that of the lyre of
