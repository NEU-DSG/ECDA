                  <p>I left <placeName>London</placeName>, and reached <placeName>Gravesend</placeName> at
                     nine in the morning, having been taught to expect 
                     our sailing in a few hours. But although
                     the vessel left <rs type="place">the Docks</rs> on Saturday, she did
                     not reach <rs type="place">this place</rs> till three o'clock on <date when="1815-11-09">Thursday, 
                     the 9th</date>. The <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> now tells me, that we
                     may expect to sail certainly in the afternoon of
                     to-morrow, the <date when="1815-11-10">10th</date>. I expect the ship's cabin
                     to gain greatly by my two days' residence at the
                     <placeName rend="quotes">***** ****</placeName>, which nothing can exceed for
                     noise, dirt, and dulness. <persName ref="#Héloïse_d'Argenteuil_1090">Eloisa</persName> would never have

                     three days at an inn at <placeName>Gravesend</placeName>: nowhere else
                     did I ever see the sky look so dingy, and the river

                     so dirty; to be sure, the place has all the advantages  
                     of an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> November to assist it in those particulars.
                     Just now, too, a carriage passed my 
                     windows, conveying on board a cargo of passengers,
                     who seemed sincerely afflicted at the thought of
                     leaving their dear native land! The <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">pigs</ecda:fauna> squeaked,
                     the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">ducks</ecda:fauna> quacked, and the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">fowls</ecda:fauna> screamed; and
                     all so dolefully, as clearly to prove, that <emph rend="italic">theirs</emph> was
                     no dissembled sorrow? And after them (more 
                     affecting than all) came a wheelbarrow, with a 
                     <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">solitary porker</ecda:fauna> tied in a basket, with his head hanging
                     over on one side, and his legs sticking out on
                     the other, who neither grunted nore moved, nor
                     gave any signs of life, but seemed to be of quite
                     the same opinion with <persName ref="#hannah_more_1745">Hannah More's</persName> heroine,

               <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, I embarked
                  on board the <ecda:shipName rend="quotes"><persName ref="#godfrey_webster_1747">Sir Godfrey Webster</persName></ecda:shipName>, <persName ref="#boyes_0001">Captain

                  the loudest of all possible shrieks proceeding from
                  a boat lying near her: and who should prove to
                  be the complainant, but my former acquaintance,
                  the despairing <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">pig</ecda:fauna>. He had recovered his voice to
                  protest against entering the ship: I had already declared
                  against climbing up the accommodation 
                  ladder; the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">pig</ecda:fauna> had precisely the very same objection.
                  So a <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">soi-disant</foreign> chair, being a broken bucket,
                  was let down for us, and the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">pig</ecda:fauna> and myself entered 
                  the vessel by the same conveyance; only <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">pig</ecda:fauna> had
                  the precedence, and was hoisted up first. The 
                  ship proceeded <measure>three miles</measure>, and then the darkness
                  obliged us to come to an anchor. There are only
                  two other cabin passengers, a <persName ref="#mr_j_0001">Mr. J―</persName> and a
                  <persName ref="#mr_s_0001">Mr. S―</persName>; the latter is a planter in the <geogName rend="quotes">May-

                  <p>We sailed at six o'clock, passed through <geogName rend="quotes">Nob's

                  where at times we had only <measure>one foot</measure> water below
                  us), by half past four, and at five came to an anchor

                 thing of the kind before, I was wonderfully pleased
                 with the manoœuvring of several large ships, which
                 passed through the sands at the same time with us:
                 their motions seemed to be effected with as much
                 ease and dexterity as if they had been crane-necked
                 carriages; and the effect as they pursued each
                 other's track and windings was perfectly beautiful.

                  <p>The wind was contrary, and we had to beat
                    up the whole way; we did not reach <geogName>the Downs</geogName>
                    till past four o'clock, and, as there were above
                    sixty vessels arrived before us, we had some difficulty
                    in finding a safe berth. At length we anchored 
                    in the <placeName>Lower Roads</placeName>, about <measure>four miles</measure> off
                    <placeName>Deal</placeName>. We can see very clearly the double lights 
                    in the vessel moored off the <placeName>Goodwin sands</placeName>: it
                    is constantly inhabited by two families, who reside
                    there alternately every fortnight, except when the
                    weather delays the exchange. The <ecda:shipName rend="quotes"><persName ref="#godfrey_webster_1747">Sir Godfrey
                    Webster</persName></ecda:shipName> is a vessel of <measure>600 tons</measure>, and was formerly
                    in the <orgName>East India service</orgName>. I have a very clean
                    cabin, a place for my books, and every thing is much
                    more comfortable than I expected; the wind, however,
                    is completely west, the worst that we could
                    have, and we must not even expect a change till the
                    full moon. The <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> pointed out a <ecda:anonPers>man</ecda:anonPers> to me
                    to-day, who had been with him in a violent storm
                    off the <placeName>Bermudas</placeName>. For six hours together, the

                  the eye could not sustain them: at one time, the

              <p>At six this morning, came on a tremendous
                 gale of wind; the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> says, that <said direct="false">he never

                 experienced a heavier.</said> However, we rode it out
                 with great success, although, at one time, it was
                 bawled out that we were driving; and, at another,
                 a brig which lay near us broke from her moorings,
                 and came bearing down close upon us. The danger,
                 indeed, from the difference of size, was all
                 upon the side of the brig; but, luckly, the vessels
                 cleared each other. This evening she has
                 thought it as well to remove further from so dangerous
                 a neighborhood. There is a little <rs type="person" ref="#jem_parsons_0001">cabin
                 boy</rs> on board, and <persName ref="#mr_j_0001">Mr. J―</persName> has brought
                 with him a <ecda:fauna>black terrier</ecda:fauna>; and these two at first
                 sight swore to each other an eternal friendship, in
                 the true <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs> style. It is the <rs type="person" ref="#jem_parsons_0001">boy's</rs> first voyage,
                 and he is excessively sea-sick; so he has been obliged
                 to creep into his hammock, and his friend, the little
                 <ecda:fauna>black terrier</ecda:fauna>, has crept into the hammock with him.
                 A boat came from the shore this evening, and reported
                 that several vessels have been dismasted, 
                 lost their anchors, and injured in various ways. A
                 brig, which was obliged to make for <placeName>Ramsgate</placeName>,
                 missed the pier, and was dashed to pieces completely;
                 the <rs type="persGroup">crew</rs>, however, were saved, all except
                 the <ecda:anonPers>pilot</ecda:anonPers>; who, although he was brought on shore
                 alive, what between bruises, drowning, and fright,
                 had suffered so much, that he died two hours afterwards.
                 The weather has now again become calm;
                 but it is still full west.

      <p>At one this morning, a violent gust of wind
         came on; and, at the rate of <measure>ten miles</measure> an hour,
      
      <pb n="17"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">9</fw>   
      carried us through the <placeName>Chops of the Channel</placeName>,
      formed by the <placeName>Scilly Rocks</placeName> and the <placeName>Isle of Ushant</placeName>.  
      But I thought, that the advance was dearly purchased 
      by the terrible night which the storm
      made us pass. The wind roaring, the waves dashing
      against the stern, till at last they beat in the
      quarter gallery; the ship, too, rolling from side 
      to side, as if every moment she were going to roll
      over and over! <persName ref="#mr_j_0001">Mr. J―</persName> was heaved off
      one of the sofas, and rolled along, till he was
      stopped by the table. He then took his seat upon
      the floor, as the more secure position; and, half an
      hour afterwards, another heave chucked him back
      again upon the sofa. The <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> snuffed out one
      of the candles, and both being tied to the table,
      could not relight it with the other: so the <ecda:anonPers>steward</ecda:anonPers>
      came to do it; when a sudden heel of the ship
      made him extinguish the second candle, tumbled 
      him upon the sofa on which I was lying, and made 
      the candle which he had brought with him fly out
      of the candlestick, through a cabin window at his
      elbow; and thus we were all left in the dark.
      Then the intolerable noise! the cracking of bulkheads!
      the sawing of ropes! the screeching of the
      tiller! the trampling of the <rs type="persGroup">sailors</rs>! the clattering
      of the crockery! Every thing above deck and
      below deck, all in motion at once! Chairs, writing-
      desks, books, boxes, bundles, fire-irons and fenders,
      flying to one end of the room; and the next moment
      (as if they had made a mistake) flying back 
      
         <pb n="18"/>
         <fw type="pageNum">10</fw>  
         
    again to the other with the same hurry and confusion!
    <quote rend="quotes" source="milton_paradise">Confusion worse confounded!</quote> Of all
    the inconveniences attached to a vessel, the incessant
    noise appears to me the most insupportable!
    As to our <ecda:commodity ana="#transport #fauna">live stock</ecda:commodity>, they seem to have made up
    their minds on the subject, and say with one of 
    <persName ref="#ludovico_ariosto_1474">Ariosto's</persName> <ecda:anonPers>knights</ecda:anonPers> (when he was cloven from the

    spite, because he can join in the general chorus 
    and help to increase the number of abominable

 <p>A complete and most violent storm, from
  twelve at night till seven the next morning. The
  fore-top-sail, though only put up for the first
  time yesterday, was rent from top to bottom; and
  several of the other sails are torn to pieces. The
  <pb n="21"/>
  <fw type="pageNum">13</fw>  
   perpetual tempestuous weather which we have 
   experienced has so shaken the planks of the vessel,
   that the sea enters at all quarters. About one
   o'clock in the morning I was saluted by a stream
   of water, which poured down exactly upon my
   face, and obliged me to shift my lodgings. The
   <ecda:anonPers>carpenter</ecda:anonPers> had been made aware that there was a 
   leak in my cabin, and ordered to caulk the seams;
   but, I suppose, he thought that during only a two
   months' voyage, the rain might very possibly never
   find out the hole, and that it would be quite time
   enough to apply the remedy when I should have
   felt the inconvenience. The best is, that the 
   <ecda:anonPers>carpenter</ecda:anonPers> happening to be at work in the next
   cabin when the water came down upon me, I 
   desired him to call my <ecda:anonPers>servant</ecda:anonPers>, in order that I
   might get up, on account of the leak; on which he 
   told me <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that the leak could not be helped;</said>
   grumbled a good deal at calling up the <ecda:anonPers>servant</ecda:anonPers>;
   and seemed to think me not a little unreasonable
   for not lying quietly, and suffering myself to be 
   pumped upon by this shower-bath of his own providing.</p>    
<p>But if the water gets <emph rend="italic">into</emph> the ship, on the
   other hand, last night the poor old <ecda:anonPers>steward</ecda:anonPers> was
   very near getting out of it. In the thick of the
   storm he was carrying some grog to the <ecda:anonPers>mate</ecda:anonPers>, when
   a gun, which drove against him, threw him off his
   balance, and he was just passing through one of the
   port-holes, when, luckly, he caught hold of a rope,
 <pb n="22"/>

  and saved himself. A <ecda:fauna>screech-owl</ecda:fauna> flew on board
  this morning: I am sure we have no need of birds
  of ill omen; I could supply the place with a whole 
  aviary of them myself.

    indeed, I understand that in these latitudes
    nothing can be expected but heavy gales or dead

    calms, which makes them particularly pleasant
    for sailing, especially as the calms are by far the
    most disagreeable of the two: the wind steadies
    the ship; but when she creeps as slowly as she 
    does at present (scarcely going <measure>a mile</measure> in four 
    hours), she feels the whole effect of the sea breaking
    against her, and rolls backwards and forwards
    with every billow as it rises and falls. In the mean 
    while, every thing seems to be in a state of the

   <p>I had no idea of the expense of building and
      preserving a ship: that which I am at present
      cost <measure ana="#currency">30,000<mcr rend="italic">l</mcr>.</measure> at its outset. Last year the repairs 
      amounted to <measure ana="#currency">14,000<mcr rend="italic">l</mcr>.</measure>; and in a voyage to the <placeName>East 
      Indies</placeName> they were more than <measure ana="#currency">20,000<mcr rend="italic">l</mcr>.</measure> In its return 
      last year from <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> it was on the very 
      brink of shipwreck. A storm had driven it into 
      <placeName>Bantry Bay</placeName>, and there was no other refuge from
      the winds than <placeName>Bear Haven</placeName>, whose entrance was
      narrow and difficult; however, a <ecda:anonPers>gentleman</ecda:anonPers> from
      <placeName>Castletown</placeName> came on board, and very obligingly
      offered to pilot the ship. He was one of the first
      people in the place, had been the owner of a vessel
      himself, was most thoroughly acquainted with every
      inch of the haven, &amp;c. &amp;c., and so on they went.
      There was but one sunken rock, and that about
      <measure>ten feet in diameter</measure>; the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> knew it, and 
      wanted his <ecda:anonPers>gentleman-pilot</ecda:anonPers> to keep a little more to
      the eastward. <said rend="quotes">My dear friend,</said> answered the

      <fw type="pageNum">19</fw>
      well enough what we are about; we are as clear of 
      the rock as if we were in the <placeName>Red Sea</placeName>, by <distinct type="dialect">Jasus</distinct>;</said>
      —upon which the vessel struck upon the rock, and
      there she stuck. The <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> fell to swearing and
      tearing his hair. <said rend="quotes">God damn you, sir! didn't I tell 
      you to keep to eastward? Dam'me, she's on the 
      rock!</said> <said rend="quotes">Oh! well, my dear, she's now <emph rend="italic">on</emph> the
      rock, and, in a few minutes, you know, why she'll
      be <emph rend="italic">off</emph> the rock: to be sure, I'd have taken my 
      oath that rock was <measure>two hundred and fifty feet</measure> 
      on the other side of her, but—</said>—<said rend="quotes"><measure>Two hundred 
      and fifty feet</measure>! why, the channel is not <measure>two 
      hundred and fifty feet</measure> wide itself! and as to getting
      her off, bumping against this rock, it can only be
      with a great hole in her side.</said>—<said rend="quotes">Poh! now, bother,
      my dear! why sure—</said>—<said rend="quotes">Leave the ship, sir; 
      dam'me, sir, get out of my ship this moment!</said> 
      Instead of which, with the most smiling and obliging 
      air in the world, the <ecda:anonPers>Irishman</ecda:anonPers> turned to console
      the <rs type="persGroup">female passengers</rs>. <said rend="quotes">Make yourselves <distinct  rend="italic" type="dialect">asy</distinct>,

      say; for the ship lies on the rock as safe and as quiet, by <distinct type="dialect">Jasus</distinct>, as if she were lying on a mud

      with her keel bumped no more. It was low water;
      she wanted but <measure>five inches</measure> to float her, and when
      <pb n="28"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">20</fw>
      the tide rose she drifted off, and with but little harm  
      done. The <ecda:anonPers>gentleman-pilot</ecda:anonPers> then thought proper
      to return on shore, took a very polite leave of the 
      <rs type="persGroup">lady-passengers</rs>, and departed with all the urbanity

   <p>Yesterday we had the satisfaction of falling in
      with the trade wind, and now we are proceeding
      both rapidly and steadily. The change of climate
      is very perceptible; and the deep and beautiful
      blue which colours the sea is a certain intimation
      of our approach to the <rs type="place">tropic</rs>. A few <ecda:fauna>flying
      fish</ecda:fauna> have made their appearance; and the spears 
      are getting in order for the reception of their 
      constant attendant, the <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna>. These spears
      have ropes affixed to them, and at one end of the
      pole are five barbs, at the other a heavy ball of 
      lead:  then, when the fish is speared, the striker 
      lets the staff fall, on which down goes the lead into
      the sea, and up goes the <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna> into the air, who
      is in the utmost astonishment to find itself all of a
      sudden turned into a <ecda:fauna>flying fish</ecda:fauna>; so determines to
      cultivate the art of flying for the future, and promises
      itself a great many pleasant airings. The
      <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna> and the <ecda:fauna>flying fish</ecda:fauna> are beautiful coloured, 
      and both are very good food, particularly the latter,
    <pb n="29"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">21</fw>   
     which move in shoals like the <ecda:fauna>herring</ecda:fauna>, and are
     about the size of that fish. They are supposed to
     feed on <ecda:fauna>spawn</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>sea animalculæ</ecda:fauna>, and will not
     take the bait; but on the shores of <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>,
     which they frequent in great multitudes, they are
     caught in wide nets, spread upon the surface of
     the sea; then, upon beating the waters around, the 
     fish rise in clouds, and fly till, their fins getting dry,
     they fall down into the nets which have been spread
     to receive them. The <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna> is seldom above
     <measure>three feet</measure> long; the immense strength which he 
     exerts in his struggles for liberty occasions the necessity
     of catching him in the way before described.</p>

    <p>Since we entered the tropic, the rains have been
       incessant, and most violent; but the wind was 
       brisk and favourable, and we proceeded rapidly.
       Now we have lost the trade-wind and move so
       <pb n="33"/>
       <fw type="pageNum">25</fw>  
        slowly, that it might almost be called standing
        still. On the other hand, the weather is now
        perfectly delicious; the ship makes but little way,
        but she moves steadily: the sun is brilliant; the
        sky cloudless; the sea calm, and so smooth that
        it looks like one extended sheet of blue glass;
        an awning is stretched over the deck; although 
        there is not wind enough to fill the canvass, there
        is sufficient to keep the air cool, and thus, even
        during the day, the weather is very pleasant; but
        the nights are quite heavenly, and so bright that
         at ten o'clock yesterday evening little 
        <persName ref="#jem_parsons_0001">Jem Parsons</persName>
        (the cabin boy), and his friend the <ecda:fauna>black terrier</ecda:fauna>,
        came on deck, and sat themselves down on a 
        gun-carriage, to read by the light of the moon. I 
        looked at the <rs type="person" ref="#jem_parsons_0001">boy's</rs> book, (the <ecda:fauna>terrier</ecda:fauna>, I suppose,
        read over the other's shoulder,) and found that it
        was <title rend="quotes" ref="#goethe_werther">The Sorrows of <persName ref="#werther_0001">Werter</persName></title>. I asked who had
        lent him such a book, and whether it amused him?
        He said that it had been made a present to him,
        and so he had read it almost through, for he had
       got to <persName ref="#werther_0001">Werter's</persName> dying; though, to be sure, he did

     <p>We caught a <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna>, but not with the spear:
      he gorged a line which was fastened to the stern, 
      and baited with <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt pork</ecda:food>; but being a very large 
      and strong fish, his efforts to escape were so powerful,
      that it was feared he would break 
      the line, and a <distinct rend="italic" type="nautical">grainse</distinct> (as the <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna>-spear is 
      technically termed) was thrown at him: he was
      struck, and three of the prongs were buried in his 
      side; yet, with a violent effort, he forced them out 
      again, and threw the lance up into the air. I am
      not much used to take pleasure in the sight of 
      animal suffering; but if <persName ref="#pythagoras_0570">Pythagoras</persName> himself had 
      been present, and <quote rend="quotes">of opinion that the soul of his 
      grandam might haply inhabit</quote> this <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna>, I think 
      he must still have admired the force and agility displayed
      in his endeavours to escape. Imagination
      can picture nothing more beautiful than the colours
      of this fish: while covered by the waves he was 
      entirely green; and as the water gave him a case
      of transparent crystal, he really looked like one
      solid piece of living emerald; when he sprang into 
      the air, or swam fatigued upon the surface, his fins 
        <pb n="35"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">27</fw> 
        
     alone preserved their green, and the rest of his body
     appeared to be of the brightest yellow, his scales shining
     like gold wherever they caught the sun; while
     the blood which, as long as he remained in the sea, 
     continued to spout in great quantities, forced its
     way upwards through the water, like a wreath of
     crimson smoke, and then dispersed itself in separate
     globules among the spray. From the great loss of 
     blood, his colours soon became paler; but when he 
     was at length safely landed on deck, and beating
     himself to death against the floring, agony renewed 
     all the lustre of his tints: his fins were still
     green and his body golden, except his back, which
     was olive, shot with bright deep blue; his head and 
     belly became silvery, and the spots with which the 
     latter was mottled changed, with incessant rapidity,
     from deep olive to the most beautiful azure. Gradually 
     his brilliant tints disappeared: they were
     succeeded by one uniform shade of slate-colour;
     and when he was quite dead, he exhibited nothing
     but dirty brown and dull dead white. As soon as
     all was over with him, the first thing done was to
     convert one of his fins into the resemblance of a 
     <ecda:fauna>flying fish</ecda:fauna>, for the purpose of decoying other <ecda:fauna>dolphins</ecda:fauna>;
     and the second, to order some of the present 
     gentleman to be got ready for dinner. He 
     measured above <measure>four feet and a half.</measure></p>

   <p>At noon to-day, we found ourselves in the latitude 
    of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. We were promised the sight
      <pb n="36"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">28</fw>  
   of Antigua on Sunday next, but that is now quite 
   out of the question. We made but <measure>eight miles</measure> in
   the whole of yesterday; and as <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is still at 
   the distance of <measure>eighteen hundred miles</measure>, at this rate 
   of proceeding we may expect to reach it about
   eight months hence. The sky this evening presented
   us with quite a new phenomenon, a rose-
   coloured moon: she is to be at her full to-morrow;
   and this afternoon, about half-past four, she rose
   like a disk of silver, perfectly white and colourless;
   but, as she was exactly opposite to the sun at the 
   time of his setting, the reflection of his rays spread
   a kind of pale blush over her orb, which produced
   an effect as beautiful as singular. Indeed, the size
   and inconceivable brilliance of the sun, the clearness
   of the atmosphere, which had assumed a faint
   greenish hue, and was entirely without a cloud,
   the smoothness of the ocean, and the aforesaid
   rose-coloured moon, altogether rendered this sunset
   the most magical in effect that I ever beheld; and
   it was with great reluctance that I was called away
   from admiring it, to ascertain whether the merits 
   of our new acquaintance, the <ecda:fauna ana="#food">dolphin</ecda:fauna>, extended
   any further than his skin. Part of him, which was
   boiled for yesterday's dinner, was rather coarse
   and dry, and might have been mistaken for
   indifferent <ecda:food ana="#fauna">haddock</ecda:food>. But his having been steeped
   in <ecda:food>brine</ecda:food>, and then broiled with a good deal of 
   <ecda:food>pepper and salt</ecda:food>, had improved him wonderfully;
   and to-day I thought him as good as any other <ecda:food ana="#fauna">fish</ecda:food>.</p>

    will have died of old age long ago. Great numbers
    of <ecda:fauna>porpoises</ecda:fauna> were playing about to-day, and
    tumbling under the ship's very nose. When in
    their gambols they allow themselves to be seen 
    above the surface, they are of a dirty blackish
    brown, and as ugly as the heart can wish; but in the
    waves they acquire a fine sea-green cast, and their
    spouting up water in the sunbeams is extremely

  <p>What little wind there is blows so perversely,
     that we have been obliged to alter our course;
     and instead of <placeName>Antigua</placeName>, we are now told that the
     <placeName>Summer Islands</placeName> (<persName ref="#william_shakespeare_1564">Shakespeare's</persName>
     <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_tempest">still vexed 
     <placeName>Bermoothes</placeName></quote>) are the first land we must 
     expect to see.</p>   
    <p>I am greatly disappointed at finding such a
       scarcity of monsters; I had flattered myself, that
       as soon as we should enter the <placeName>Atlantic Ocean</placeName>,
       <pb n="40"/>
       <fw type="pageNum">32</fw>  
      or at least the <rs type="place">tropic</rs>, we should have seen whole
       shoals of <ecda:fauna>sharks</ecda:fauna>, <ecda:fauna>whales</ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:fauna>dolphins</ecda:fauna> wandering
       about  as plenty as <ecda:fauna>sheep</ecda:fauna> upon the <geogName>South Downs</geogName>:
       instead of which, a brace of <ecda:fauna>dolphins</ecda:fauna>, and a few 
       <ecda:fauna>flying fish</ecda:fauna> and <ecda:fauna>porpoises</ecda:fauna>, are the only inhabitants 
       of the ocean who have as yet taken the
       trouble of paying us the common civility of a visit.
       However, I am promised, that as soon as we approach
       the islands, I shall have as many <ecda:fauna>sharks</ecda:fauna> 
       as heart can wish.</p> 
      <p>As I am particularly fond of proofs of conjugal
      attachment between animals (in the human species
      they are so universal that I set no store by them),
      an instance of that kind which the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> 
      related to me this morning gave me great 
      pleasure. While lying in <placeName>Black River harbour</placeName>, 
      <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> two <ecda:fauna>sharks</ecda:fauna> were frequently seen playing
      about the ship; at length the female was killed,
      and the desolation of the male was excessive:—
       <quote rend="quotes" source="gluck_orfeo" xml:lang="it">Che faro senz' <persName ref="#eurydice_0001">Eurydice</persName>?</quote>
       What he did <emph rend="italic">without</emph> her remains a secret, but

       he stuck his teeth in her, and began to eat her up
       with all possible expedition. Even the <rs type="persGroup">sailors</rs> felt
       their sensibility excited by so peculiar a mark of
       posthumous attachment; and to enable him to perform
       this melancholy duty the more easily, they
       offered to be his carvers, lowered their boat, and

         <fw type="pageNum">33</fw> 
       proceeded to chop his better half in pieces with
       their hatchets; while the widower opened his jaws
       as wide as possible, and gulped down pounds upon
       pounds of the dear departed as fast as they were
       thrown to him, with the greatest delight and all
       the avidity imaginable. I make no doubt that all
       the while he was eating, he was thoroughly persuaded
       that every morsel which went into his
       stomach would make its way to his heart directly!
         <said rend="quotes">She was perfectly consistent,</said> he said to himself;
         <said rend="quotes">she was excellent through life, and really she's

       I doubt, whether the annals of <persName ref="#hymen_0001">Hymen</persName> can produce
         a similar instance of post-obitual affection, Certainly

         has nothing that is worthy to be compared to it;
         nor do I recollect in history any fact at all resembling
         it, except perhaps a circumstance which is
         recorded respecting <persName ref="#cambletes_0001">Cambletes, King of <placeName>Lydia</placeName></persName>, a

         what he was doing; whereas the shark's
         mark of attachment was evidently intentional. It
         may, however, be doubted, from the voracity with
         which he eat, whether his conduct on this occasion
         was not as much influenced by the sentiment of
         hunger as of love; and if he were absolutely
         on the point of starving, <persName ref="#torquato_tasso_1544">Tasso</persName> might have applied
         to this couple, with equal truth, although

      exclamations, and raptures, and refinements, read

       travels; much less any which had the slightest

       of them were reading what they could not possibly

     <p>The weather is so excessively close and sultry,
        that it would be allowed to be too hot to be pleasant,
        even by that perfect model for all future
        lords of the bedchamber, who was never known
        to speak a word, except in praise, of any thing
        living or dead, through the whole course of his
        life: but, at last, one day he met with an accident
        —he happened to die; and the next day he
        met with another accident—he happened to be
        damned: and immediately upon his arrival in the 
        infernal regions, the <name>Devil</name> (who was determined to
        be as well bred as the other could be for his ears,)
        came to pay his compliments to the new-comer,
        and very obligingly expressed his concerns that his
        lordship was not very likely to feel satisfied with his new
        abode; for that he must certainly find hell very 
   <pb n="46"/>
  <fw type="pageNum">38</fw>    
        hot and disagreeable. <said rend="quotes">Oh, dear no!</said> exclaimed
        the <ecda:anonPers>Lord of the Bedchamber</ecda:anonPers>, <said rend="quotes">not at all disagreeable,
        by any manner of means, <name>Mr. Devil</name>, upon
        my word and honour! Rather <emph rend="italic">warm</emph>, to be sure.</said>
        In point of heat, there is no difference between the 
        days and the nights; or if there is any, it is that
        the nights are rather the hottest of the two. The
        lightning is incessant, and it does not show itself
        forked or in flashes, but in wide sheets of mild blue
        light, which spread themselves at once over the sky
        and sea; and, for the moment which they last,
        make all the objects around as distinct as daylight.
        The moon now does not rise till near ten
        o'clock, and during her absence the size and brilliancy
        of the stars are admirable. In <placeName>England</placeName>
        they always seemed to me (to borrow a phrase of
        <persName ref="#william_shakespeare_1564">Shakespeare's</persName>, which, in truth, is not worth borrowing,)
        to <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_macbeth">peep through the blanket of the dark</quote>;
        but here the heavens appear to be studded with
        them on the outside, as if they were chased with
        so many jewels: it is really <persName ref="#john_milton_1608">Milton's</persName> <quote rend="quotes" source="milton_paradise">firmament
        of living sapphires</quote>; and what with the lightning,
        the stars, and the quantity of floating lights which
        just gleamed round the ship every moment, and
        then were gone again, to-night the sky had an
        effect so beautiful, that when at length the moon
        thought proper to shower her great red drunken
        face, I thought we did much better without
        her.
     </p>
     <p>The above-mentioned floating lights are a kind 
 <pb n="47"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">39</fw> 
        of sea-meteors, which, I am told, are produced
        by the concussions of the waves, while eddying
        in the whirlpools round the rudder; but still I saw 
        them rise sometimes at so great a distance from the
        ship, and there appeared to be something so like
        <mcr rend="italic">Will</mcr> in the direction of their course,—sometimes
        hurrying on, sometimes gliding along quite slowly;
        now stopping and remaining motionless for a minute
        or two, and then hurrying on again,—that I could
        not be convinced of their not being <ecda:fauna>Medusæ</ecda:fauna>, or 
        some species of other <ecda:fauna>phosphoric animal</ecda:fauna>: but
        whatever be the cause of this appearance, the
        effect is singularly beautiful. As to air, we have
        not enough to bless ourselves with. I had been
        led to believe, that when once we should have
        fallen in with the trade winds, from that moment
        we should sail into our destined port as rapidly
        and as directly as <persName ref="#truffaldino_0001">Truffaldino</persName> travels in <persName ref="#carlo_gozzi_1720">Gozzi's</persName>
        farce; when, having occasion to go from <placeName>Asia</placeName> to
        <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and being very much pressed for time,
        he persuades a conjuror of his acquaintance to
        lend him a devil, with a great pair of bellows, the
        nozzle of which being directed right against his 
        stern, away goes the traveller before the stream
        of wind, with the devil after him, and the infernal
        bellows never cease from working till they
        have blown him out of one quarter of the globe
        into another: but our trade winds must <quote rend="quotes" source="milton_paradise">hide
        their diminished heads</quote> before <persName ref="#truffaldino_0001">Truffaldino's</persName> bellows.
        It seems that like the <name>Moors</name>, <quote rend="quotes">in <placeName>Africa</placeName>

        blow, they will in one certain direction,
        yet very often they will not blow at all; which has
        been our case for the last week: indeed, they seem
        to be but a queerish kind of concern at best. 
        About three years ago a fleet of merchantmen was 
        becalmed near <placeName>St. Vincent's</placeName>: in a few days after
        their arrival, there happened a violent eruption of
        a volcano in that island, nor was it long before a
        favourable breeze sprang up. Unluckily, one of
        the ships had anchored rather nearer to the shore 
        than the others, and was at the distance of about
        <measure>one hundred and fifty yards</measure> from the stream of the 
        trade wind; nor could any possible efforts of the 
        crew, by tacking, by towing, or otherwise, ever
        enable the vessel to conquer that <measure>one hundred and
        fifty yards</measure>: there she remained, as completely becalmed
        as if there were not such a thing as a 
        breath of wind in the universe; and on the one 
        hand she had the mortification to see the rest of the 
        merchantmen, with their convoy (for it was in the 
        very heat of the war), sail away with all their canvass
        spread and swelling; while, on the other
        hand, the <rs type="persGroup">sailors</rs> had the comfortable possibility of
        being suffocated every moment by the clouds of
        ashes which continued to fall on their deck every
        moment, from the burning volcano, although they
        were not nearer to <placeName>St. Vincent's</placeName> than <measure>eight or nine
        miles</measure>; indeed that distance went for nothing, as 
  <pb n="49"/>
  <fw type="pageNum">41</fw>      
        ashes fell upon vessels that were out at sea at least
       <measure>five hundred miles</measure>; and <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName> being to windward
        of the volcano, such immense quantities of 
        its contents were carried to that island as almost
        covered the fields; and destroying <ecda:flora ana="#commodity">vegetation</ecda:flora> completely
        wherever they fell, did inconceivable damage,
        while that which <placeName>St. Vincent's</placeName> itself experienced
        was but trifling in proportion. 
     </p>
     <p>Our captain is quite out of patience with the <ecda:fauna>tortoise</ecda:fauna>
        pace of our progress; for my part I care very 
        little about it. Whether we have sailed slowly or
        rapidly, I am just as much
        nearer advanced towards April, the time fixed for
        my return to <placeName>England</placeName>; and, what is of much more
        consequence, when a day is once over, I am just as much
        nearer advanced towards <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_hamlet">that bourne</quote>, to reach

    <p>We succeeded in catching another <ecda:fauna ana="#food">dolphin</ecda:fauna> today;
    but he did not have a hat on; however, I just 
    asked him whether he happened to have seen mine,

    tell me nothing at all about it; so, instead of
    bothering the poor animal with any more questions,

     <p>About three years ago, the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">Captain</rs> had the ill
        luck to be captured by a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> frigate. As she
        had already made prizes of two other merchantmen, 
        it was determined to sink his ship; which, 
        after removing the crew and every thing in her
        that was valuable, was effected by firing her own
        guns down the hatchways. It was near three 
        hours before she filled, then down she went with a 
        single plunge, head foremost, with all her saisl set
        and colours flying. This display of the ship's 
        magnificence in her last moments reminded me of
        <persName ref="#mary_stuart_1542">Mary Queen of Scots</persName>, arraying herself in her
        richest robes that she might go to the scaffold. If

        all the abilities for a long existence, yet abandoned
        by every one, and sinking from the effect of her

      <p>At length we have crawled into the <placeName>Caribbean

       <emph rend="italic">to-day</emph> by no means implies that we shall not see it
       before <emph rend="italic">to-morrow</emph>; for the nautical day is supposed
       to conclude at noon, when the solar observation is
       taken; and, therefore, the making land <emph rend="italic">to-day</emph>, or
       not, very often depends on our making it before
       twelve o'clock, or after it. This was the case in the 
       present instance; for noon was scarcely passed when
       we saw <placeName>Descada</placeName> (a small island totally unprovided
      with water, and whose only produce consists in a

      though the latter was at so great a distance as to

        lying about six miles from <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>, which

        all our muskets have been put in repair,

      <p>At day-break Jamaica was in sight, or rather
         it would have been in sight, only that we could
         not see it. The weather was so gloomy, and the

         morning. However, about noon the weather cleared 
         up, and allowed us to verify with our own eyes,
         that we had reached <quote rend="quotes">the Land of Springs</quote>, without
         having been invited by any <rs type="properAdjective">Piccaroon</rs> vessel to
         <quote rend="quotes"><distinct type="nautical">walk the plank</distinct></quote> instead of the deck; which is
         a compliment very generally paid by those <rs type="persGroup">gentry</rs>,
         after they have taken the trouble of laying a plank
         over the side of a captured ship, in order that the
         passengers and the crew may walk overboard without
         any inconvenience.
      </p> 
      <p>We arrived at the east end of the island, passed
         <placeName>Pedro Point</placeName> and <placeName>Starvegut Bay</placeName>, and arrived
         before <placeName>Black River Bay</placeName> (our destined harbour)
         soon after two o'clock; but here we were obliged 
         to come to a stand still: the channel is very
         dangerous, extremely narrow, and full of sunken
         rocks; so that it can only be entered by a vessel
         drawing so much water as ours with a particular
         wind, and when there is not any apprehension of
         a sudden squall. We were, therefore, obliged to
         drop anchor, and are now riding within a couple 
         of miles of the shore, but with as utter an incapability
         of reaching it as if we were still at 
         <placeName>Gravesend</placeName>. The north side of the island is said to
         be extremely beautiful and romantic; but the south,
         which we coasted to-day, is low, barren, and without
         any recommendation whatever. As yet I can 
         only look at <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> as one does on a man who
         comes to pay <seg ana="#currency">money</seg>, and whom we are extremely

       <p>We passed the whole of the day in vain endeavours
          to work ourselves into the bay. At one
          time, indeed, we got very near the shore, but the
          consequence was, that we were within an ace of
          striking upon a rock, and very much obliged to
          a sudden gust of wind, which, blowing right off
          shore, blew us right out of the channel, and left us at
          night in a much more perilous situation than we
          had occupied the evening before, though even that
          had been by no means secure. At three o'clock,
          the <rs type="persGroup">other passengers</rs> went on shore in the jolly-
          boat, and proceeded to their destination; but as I
          was still more than <measure>thirty miles</measure> distant from my

          <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">Captain</rs> should have moored his vessel in safety,
          and be at liberty to take me in his pinnace to

        <p>In the course of the afternoon, one of the sailors
           took up a fish of a very singular shape and most
           brilliant colours, as it floated along upon the water.
           It seemed to be gasping, and lay with its belly upwards;
           it was supposed to have eaten something 
           poisonous, as wherever it was touched it appeared
           to be full of life, and squirted the water in our
           faces with great spirit and dexterity. But no
           sooner was he suffered to remain quiet in the tub,
           than he turned upon his back and again was gasp-
     <pb n="58"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">50</fw>  
           ing. He had a large round transparent globule,
           intersected with red veins, under the belly, which
           some imagined to proceed from a rupture, and to
           be the occasion of his disease. But I could not
           discover any vestige of a wound; and the globule
           was quite solid to the touch; neither did the fish
           appear to be sensible when it was pressed upon.
           No one on board had ever seen this kind of fish
           till then; its name is the <ecda:fauna><distinct type="scientific" rend="quotes">Doctor Fish</distinct></ecda:fauna>.
        </p>
        
        <p>A <ecda:anonPers>black pilot</ecda:anonPers> came on board yesterday, in a
           canoe hollowed out of the <ecda:flora>cotton-tree</ecda:flora>; and when
           it returned for him this morning, it brought us
           a <ecda:food ana="#flora">water-melon</ecda:food>. I have never met with a worse article
           in my life; the pulp is of a faint greenish yellow,
           stained here and there with spots of moist red, so
           that it looks exactly as if the servant in slicing it
           had cut his finger, and suffered it to bleed over
           the fruit. Then the seeds, being of a dark purple,
           present the happiest imitation of drops of clotted
           gore; and altogether (prejudiced as I was by its
           appearance), when I had put a single bit into my 
           mouth, it had such a kind of <rs type="properAdjective" ref="#shakespeare_venice">Shylocky</rs> taste of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">raw

      of <placeName>Black River</placeName>. The <name><distinct type="dialect" ana="#performance">John-Canoe</distinct></name> is a <name><distinct type="dialect" ana="#performance">Merry-
      Andrew</distinct></name> dressed in a striped doublet, and bearing
      upon his head a kind of pasteboard house-boat,
      filled with puppets, representing, some sailors, others
      soldiers, others again slaves at work on a plantation,
      &amp;c. The <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are allowed three days for
      holidays at <name>Christmas</name>, and also <name>New-year's day</name>,
      which being the last is always reckoned by them
      as the festival of the greatest importance. It is 
      for this day that they reserve their finest dresses,
      and lay their schemes for displaying their show
      and expense to the greatest advantage; and it is
      then that the <name ana="#performance">John-Canoe</name> is considered not merely
      as a person of material consequence, but one whose
      presence is absolutely indispensable. Nothing could
      look more gay than the procession which we now
      saw with its <rs type="persGroup">train of attendants</rs>, all dressed in white, 
   <pb n="60"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">52</fw> 
      and matching two by two (except when the file
      was broken here and there by <rs type="person">a single horseman</rs>),
      and its band of negro music, and its scarlet flags
      fluttering about in the breeze, now disappearing
      behind a projecting clump of <ecda:flora>mangrove trees</ecda:flora>, and
      then again emerging into an open part of the road,
      as it wound along the shores towards the town of 
      <placeName>Black River</placeName>.

      I had determined not to go on shore, till I should
      land for good and all at <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName>. But
      although I could resist the <quote rend="quotes" xml:lang="it">telluris amor,</quote> there 
      was no resisting <name ana="#performance">John-Canoe</name>; so, in defiance of a 
      broiling afternoon's sun, about four o'clock we
      left the vessel for the <rs type="place">town</rs>. 
   </p> 
   <p>It was, as I understand, formerly one of some
      magnitude; but it now consists only of a few
      houses, owning to a spark from a tobacco-pipe or
      a candle having lodged upon a mosquito-net during
      dry weather; and although the conflagration took
      place at mid-day, the whole <rs type="place">town</rs> was reduced to
      ashes. The few streets—(I believe there were
      not above two, but those were wide and regular,
      and the houses looked very neat)—were now
      crowded with <rs type="persGroup">people</rs>, and it seemed to be allowed,
      upon all hands, that <name>New-year's day</name> had never been
      celebrated there with more expense and festivity.

  <p>It seems that, many years ago, an <ecda:anonPers>Admiral of the
     Red</ecda:anonPers> was superseded on the <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> station by an
     <ecda:anonPers>Admiral of the Blue</ecda:anonPers>; and both of them gave balls
     at <placeName>Kingston</placeName> to the <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes"><rs type="persGroup" rend="italic">Brown Girls</rs></distinct>; for the fair sex
     elsewhere are called the <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes"><rs type="persGroup">Brown Girls</rs></distinct> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.
     In consequence of these balls, all <placeName>Kingston</placeName> was divided 
     into parties: from thence the division spread
     into other districts: and ever since, the whole
     island, at <name>Christmas</name>, is separated into the rival
     factions of the <name>Blues</name> and the <name>Reds</name> (the <name>Red</name> representing
     also the <name>English</name>, the <name>Blue</name> the <name>Scotch</name>),
     who contend for setting forth their processions
     with the greatest taste and magnificence. This 
     year, several <rs type="persGroup">gentlemen</rs> in the neighbourhood of 
     <placeName>Black River</placeName> had subscribed very largely towards
     the expense of the show; and certainly it produced
     the gayest and most amusing scene that I ever
     witnessed, to which the mutual jealousy and pique
     of the two parties against each other contributed 
     in no slight degree. The champions of the rival
     <name>Roses</name>,—the <name>Guelphs</name> and the <name>Ghibellines</name>,—none of 
     them could exceed the scornful animosity and spirit
     of deprecation with which the <name>Blues</name> and the <name>Reds</name>
     of <placeName>Black River</placeName> examined the efforts at display of 
     each other. The <name>Blues</name> had the advantage beyond
     a doubt; this <ecda:anonPers>a Red girl</ecda:anonPers> told us that she could not
     deny; but still, <said direct="false" rend="quotes">though the <name>Reds</name> were beaten,
     she would not be a Blue girl for the whole universe!</said>
     On the other hand, <persName ref="#edwards_0001">Miss Edwards</persName> (the 
     mistress of the hotel from whose window we saw 
  <pb n="62"/>
  <fw type="pageNum">54</fw> 
     the show), was rank Blue to the very tips of her
     finters, and had, indeed, contributed <ecda:anonPers>one of her
     female slaves</ecda:anonPers> to sustain a very important character
     in the show; for when the Blue procession was ready
     to set forward, there was evidently a hitch, something
     was wanting; and there seemed to be no
     possibility of getting on without it—when suddenly
     we saw a tall woman dressed in mourning (being
     <persName ref="#edwarts_0001">Miss Edwards</persName> herself) rush out of our hotel, dragging
     along by the hand <seg ana="#performance"><ecda:anonPers>a strange uncouth kind 
     of glittering tawdry figure</ecda:anonPers>, all feathers, and pitch-
     fork, and painted pasteboard, who moved most
     reluctantly, and turned out to be no less a personage
     than <persName ref="#britannia_0001">Britannia</persName> herself, with a pasteboard shield
     covered with the arms of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, a trident
     in her hand, and a helmet made of pale blue silk
     and silver. The <ecda:anonPers>poor girl</ecda:anonPers>, it seems, was 
     bashful at appearing in this conspicuous manner before so
     many <rs type="persGroup">spectators</rs>, and hung back when it came to
     the point. But her mistress had seized hold of
     her, and placed her by main force in her destined
     position. The music struck up; <persName ref="#edwards_0001">Miss Edwards</persName>
     gave the <ecda:anonPers>Goddess</ecda:anonPers> a great push forwards; the drum-
     sticks and the elbows of the <rs type="persGroup">fiddlers</rs> attacked her
     in the rear; and on went <ecda:anonPers><name>Britannia</name></ecda:anonPers> willy-nilly!</seg>
  </p>  
    <p><rs type="persGroup">The Blue girls</rs> called themselves <quote rend="quotes"><rs type="persGroup">the Blue girls</rs>

 <pb n="63"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">55</fw> 
     in point of taste and invention, the former carried
     it hollow. First marched <ecda:anonPers><name>Britannia</name></ecda:anonPers>; then came a
       band of music; then the flag; then the <ecda:anonPers>Blue King</ecda:anonPers>
       and <ecda:anonPers>Queen</ecda:anonPers>—the <ecda:anonPers>Queen</ecda:anonPers> splendidly dressed in
       white and silver (in scorn of the opposite party, her
       train was born by a <ecda:anonPers>little girl</ecda:anonPers> in red); his <ecda:anonPers>Majesty</ecda:anonPers>
       wore a full British Admiral's uniform, with a white
       satin sash, and a huge cocked hat with a gilt paper
       crown upon the top of it. These were immediately
       followed by <name rend="quotes"><persName ref="#horatio_nelson_1758">Nelson's</persName> car</name>, being a kind of canoe
       decorated with blue and silver drapery, and with
       <quote rend="quotes">Trafalgar</quote> written on the front of it; and the
       procession was closed by a long train of <rs type="persGroup">Blue
       grandees</rs> (the <rs type="persGroup">women</rs> dressed in uniforms of white,
       with robes of blue muslin), all Princes and Princesses,
       Dukes and Duchesses, every mother's child
       of them.
    </p>
     <p><rs type="persGroup">The Red girls</rs> were also dressed very gaily
        and prettily, but they had nothing in point of

        <ecda:anonPers><name>Britannia</name></ecda:anonPers>; and when the Red throne made its

       was evidently <persName ref="#edwards_0001">Miss Edwards's</persName> <persName ref="#grundy_0001">Mrs. Grundy</persName>. <ecda:anonPers><name ana="#performance">John-

        heard, but could not obtain a sight), seemed to act
        upon quite an independent interest, and go about
        from house to house, tumbling and playing antics
        to pick up <seg ana="#currency">money</seg> for themselves.
     </p>
     <p><seg ana="#performance">A play was now proposed to us, and, of course,

        could be more light, and playful, and graceful,
        than the extempore movements of the <ecda:anonPers>dancing girl</ecda:anonPers>.</seg>
        Indeed, through the whole day, I had been struck
        with the precision of their march, the ease and

        and the lofty air with which they carried their

        hung down hers in the most ungoddess-like manner

        air of <title rend="quotes" ref="#halket_logie"><persName ref="#logie_0001">Logie</persName> of <placeName>Buchan</placeName></title>, of which the <ecda:anonPers>girl</ecda:anonPers>

      flew, <rs type="persGroup">singers, dancers, and all</rs>.</seg> The cause of this
      was the sudden illumination of the town with
      quantities of large chandeliers and <ecda:flora>bushes</ecda:flora>, the 
      branches of which were stuck all over with great
      blazing torches: the effect was really beautiful, 
      and the excessive rapture of the <rs type="persGroup">black multitude</rs> at
      the spectacle was as well worth the witnessing as
      the sight itself.
     </p>
   <p>I never saw so many people who appeared to be
      so unaffectedly happy. In <placeName>England</placeName>, at fairs and
      races, half the visitors at least seem to have been
      only brought there for the sake of traffic, and to
      be too busy to be amused; but here nothing was
      thought of but real pleasure; and that pleasure
      seemed to consist in singing, dancing, and laughing,
      in seeing and being seen, in showing their own
      fine clothes, or in admiring those of others. There
      were no people selling or buying; no servants and
      landladies bustling and passing about; and at eight
      o'clock, as we passed through the market-place,
      where was the greatest illumination, and which, of
      course, was most thronged, I did not see a single
      person drunk, nor had I observed a single quarrel
      through the course of the day; except, indeed, 
   <pb n="67"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">59</fw>  
      when some thoughtless fellow crossed the line of
      the procession, and received by the way a good
      box of the ear from the <ecda:anonPers>Queen</ecda:anonPers> or one of her attendant
      <rs type="persGroup">Duchesses</rs>. Every body made the same remark

      this one specimen, of all beings I have yet

        there was a violent swell in the sea; and a
        strong north wind, though it carried us forward  
        with great rapidity, overwhelmed us with whole
        sheets of foam so incessantly, that I expected, as
        soon as the sun should have evaporated the 
        moisture, to see the boat's <rs type="persGroup">crew</rs> covered with salt,
        and looking like so many <rs type="persGroup"><persName ref="#lot_0001">Lot's</persName> wives</rs> after her

     <p>The distance was about <measure>thirty miles</measure>, and soon

        where I found <ecda:anonPers>my trustee</ecda:anonPers>, and a whole cavalcade,
        waiting to conduct me to my own estate; for he
        had brought with him a curricle and pair for
        myself, a gig for my servant, <rs type="persGroup">two black boys</rs> upon 
        <ecda:fauna>mules</ecda:fauna>, and a cart with eight <ecda:fauna>oxen</ecda:fauna> to convey my

        which ensued sets all description at defiance.
        The works were instantly all abandoned; every

        arriving too late. Whether the pleasure of the
        <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> was sincere may be doubted; but certainly
        it was the loudest that I ever witnessed: they all
        talked together, sang, danced, shouted, and, in the
        violence of their gesticulations, tumbled over each
        other, and rolled about upon the ground. Twenty

        Massa, look here! him nice lilly neger for Massa</distinct>!</said>
        <ecda:anonPers>Another</ecda:anonPers> complained,—<said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">So long since none come
        see we, Massa; good Massa, come at last</distinct>.</said> As for
        <rs type="persGroup">the old people,</rs> they were all in one and the same
        story: now they had lived to see <distinct type="dialect">Massa</distinct>, they
        were ready for dying to-morrow, <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">them no care</distinct>.</said>       
     </p>
     <p>The shouts, the gaiety, the wild laughter, their
        strange and sudden bursts of dancing,
        and several <rs type="persGroup">old women</rs>, wrapped up in large cloaks,
        their heads bound round with different-coloured
        handkerchiefs, leaning on a staff, and standing
        motionless in the middle of the hubbub, with their
        eyes fixed upon the portico which I occupied,
        formed an exact counterpart of the festivity of the
        <rs type="persGroup">witches</rs> in <title ref="#shakespeare_macbeth"><persName ref="#macbeth_0001">Macbeth</persName></title>. Nothing could be more odd
        or more novel than the whole scene; and yet there
        was something in it by which I could not help 
        being affected; perhaps it was the consciousness 
   <pb n="70"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">62</fw>  
        that <rs type="persGroup">all these human beings</rs> were my <rs type="persGroup"><emph rend="italic">slaves</emph></rs>;—to be
        sure, I never saw people look more happy in my 
        life; and I believe their condition to be much
        more comfortable than that of the labourors of 
        <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>; and, after all, slavery, in <emph rend="italic">their</emph> case,
        is but another name for servitude, now that no
        more <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> can be forcibly carried away from
        <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and subjected to the horrors of the voyage,
        and of <distinct type="economic">the seasoning</distinct> after their arrival: but
        still I had already experienced, in the morning,
        that <persName ref="#juliet_0001">Juliet</persName> was wrong in saying <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_juliet">What's in a
        name?</quote> For soon after my reaching the <rs type="place">lodging-
        house</rs> at <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName>, a remarkably clean-
        looking <ecda:anonPers>negro lad</ecda:anonPers> presented himself with some
        water and a towel: I concluded him to belong to
        the inn; and, on my returning the towel, as he
        found that I took no notice of him, he at length
        ventured to introduce himself, by saying,—<said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Massa
        not know me; <emph rend="italic">me your slave</emph></distinct>!</said>—and really the
        sound made me feel a pang at the heart. The
        lad appeared all gaiety and good humour, and his
        whole countenance expressed anxiety to recommend
        himself to my notice; but the word <distinct type="mentioned" rend="quotes">slave</distinct>
        seemed to imply, that, although he did feel pleasure
        then in serving me, if he had detested me he must
        have served me still. I really felt quite humiliated
        at the moment, and was tempted to tell him,—<said rend="quotes">Do
        not say that again; say that you are my negro, but
        do not call yourself my slave.</said>
     </p>
       <p>Altogether, they shouted and sang me into a
     <pb n="71"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">63</fw>  
        violent headach. It is now one in the morning,
        and I hear them still shouting and singing. I gave
        them a holiday for Saturday next, and told them
        that I had brought them all presents from <placeName>England</placeName>;
        and so, I believe, we parted very good friends.

       <p>I have reached <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> in the best season for
          seeing my property in a favourable point of view;
          it is crop time, when all the laborious work is
          over, and the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are the most healthy and 
          merry. This morning I went to visit the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>,
          and found there only eight <rs type="persGroup">patients</rs> out of 
          three hundred <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, and not one of them a
          serious case. Yesterday I had observed a remarkably 
          handsome <rs type="properAdjective">Creole</rs> girl, called <persName ref="#psyche_0001">Psyche</persName>, and she
          really deserved the name. This morning a little
          brown girl made her appearance at breakfast, with
          an <ecda:flora>orange bough</ecda:flora>, to flap away the <ecda:fauna>flies</ecda:fauna>, and, on
          enquiry, she proved to be an emanation of the
          aforesaid <persName ref="#psyche_0001">Psyche</persName>. It is evident, therefore, that
          <persName ref="#psyche_0001">Psyche</persName> has already visited the palace of <persName ref="#cupid_0001">Cupid</persName>; I
          heartily hope that she is not now upon her road to
          the infernal regions: but, as the ancients had two
          <name>Cupids</name>, one divine and the other sensual, so am I
          in possession of two <name>Psyches</name>; and on visiting the 
          <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, <emph rend="italic">there</emph> was poor <persName ref="#psyche_0002">Psyche</persName> the second. Probably
          this was the <persName ref="#psyche_0002">Psyche</persName> of the sensual <persName ref="#cupid_0001">Cupid</persName>.
       </p>   
       <p>I passed the morning in driving about the <rs type="place">estate</rs>:
          <rs type="place">my house</rs> is frightful to look at, but very clean and 
      <pb n="72"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">64</fw>  
          comfortable on the inside; some of the scenery is
          very picturesque, from the lively green of the <ecda:flora>trees</ecda:flora>
          and <ecda:flora>shrubs</ecda:flora>, and the hermitage-like appearance of
          the negro buildings, all situated in little gardens,
          and embosomed in sweet-smelling <ecda:flora>shrubberies</ecda:flora>. Indeed,
          every thing appears much better than I expected;
          the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> seem healthy and contented,
          and so perfectly at their ease, that our <rs type="persGroup"><rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> 
          squires</rs> would be mightily astonished at being
          accosted so familiarly by their <rs type="persGroup">farmers</rs>. This delightful
          north wind keeps the air temperate and 
          agreeable. I live upon <ecda:food ana="#flora">shaddocks</ecda:food> and <ecda:food ana="#flora">pine-apples</ecda:food>.
          The dreaded <ecda:fauna>mosquitoes</ecda:fauna> are not worse than <ecda:fauna>gnats</ecda:fauna>,
          nor as bad as the <ecda:fauna><rs type="properAdjective">Sussex</rs> harvest-bugs</ecda:fauna>; and, as yet
          I never felt myself in more perfect health. There
          was a man once, who fell from the top of a steeple;
          and, perceiving no inconvenience in his passage
          through the air,—<said rend="quotes">Come,</said> said he to himself, while
          in the act of falling, <said rend="quotes">really this is well enough yet
          if it would but last.</said> <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName>, my young <placeName>Savannah
          la Mar</placeName> acquaintance, is appointed my black attendant;
          and as I had desired him to bring me any
          native flowers of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, this evening he brought
          me a very pretty one; the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, he said, called

         <p>There were three things against which I was

     <pb n="73"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">65</fw>      
            was determined <emph rend="italic">not</emph> to do: to take exercise
            after ten in the day; to be exposed to the dews
            after sun-down; and to sleep at a <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> lodging-
            house. So, yesterday, I set of for <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName> at
            eight o'clock in the morning, and travelled till
            three; walked home from a ball after midnight;
            and that home was a <rs type="place">lodging-house</rs> at <placeName>Montego
            Bay</placeName>; but the <rs type="place">lodging-house</rs> was such a cool clean
            <rs type="place">lodging-house</rs>, and the <rs type="person" ref="#judy_james_0001">landlady</rs> was such an obliging
            smiling landlady, with the whitest of all possible
            teeth, and the blackest of all possible eyes,
            that no harm could happen to me from occupying
            an apartment which had been prepared by <emph rend="italic">her</emph>.
            She was called out of her bed to make my room
            ready for me; yet she did every thing with so
            much good-will and cordiality; no quick answers,
            no mutterings: inns would be bowers of Paradise,
            if they were all rented by mulatto landladies, like
            <persName ref="#judy_james_0001">Judy James</persName>.
         </p>
         <p>I was much pleased with the scenery of <placeName>Montego
         Bay</placeName>, and with the neatness and cleanliness 
            of the town; indeed, what with the sea washing
            it, and the picturesque aspects of the piazzas and
            verandas, it is impossible for a West Indian town
            so situated, and in such a climate, not to present
            an agreeable appearance. But the first part of
            the road exceeds in beauty all that I have ever
            seen: it wound through mountain lands of my
            own, their summits of the boldest, and at the same
            time of the most beautiful shapes; their sides orna-
       <pb n="74"/>
       <fw type="pageNum">66</fw>  
            mented with bright green woods of <ecda:flora>bamboo</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora>log-
            wood</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora>prickly-yellow</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora>broad-leaf</ecda:flora>, and <ecda:flora>trumpet trees</ecda:flora>;
            and so completely covered with the most lively
            <ecda:flora>verdure</ecda:flora>, that once, when we found a piece of barren
            rock, <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName> pointed it out to me as a curiosity;—
            <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Look, massa, rock quite naked</distinct>!</said> The <ecda:flora>cotton-
            tree</ecda:flora> presented itself on all sides; but as this is the
            season for its shedding its leaves, its wide-spreading 
            bare white arms contributed nothing to the beauty
            of the scene, except where the <ecda:flora ana="#food">wild fig</ecda:flora> and various
            <ecda:flora>creeping plants</ecda:flora> had completely mantled the stems
            and branches; and then its gigantic height, and 
            the fantastic wreathings of its limbs, from which
            numberless <ecda:flora>green withes</ecda:flora> and strings of <ecda:flora>wild flowers</ecda:flora>
            were streaming, rendered it exactly the very tree
            for which a landscape-painter would have wished.
            The air, too, was delicious; the fragrance of the
            <ecda:flora>Sweet-wood</ecda:flora>, and of several other <ecda:flora>scented trees</ecda:flora>, but
            above all, of the delicious <ecda:flora>Logwood</ecda:flora> (of which most
            of the fences in <placeName>Westmoreleand</placeName> are made) composed
            an atmosphere, such, that, if <persName ref="#lucifer_0001">Satan</persName>, after promising
            them <quote rend="quotes" source="milton_paradise">a buxom air, embalmed with odours</quote>, had
            transported <name>Sin</name> and <name>Death</name> thither, the charming

            fulfilled.

         <p>We travelled these first <measure>ten miles</measure> (<placeName>Montego Bay</placeName>
            being about thirty miles from my estate of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>)
            without seeing a human creature, nor, indeed,
            any thing that had life in it, except a <ecda:fauna>black snake</ecda:fauna>
            basking in the sunshine, and a few <ecda:fauna><distinct type="scientific">John Crows</distinct></ecda:fauna>
        <pb n="75"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">67</fw>     
            —a species of <ecda:fauna>vulture</ecda:fauna>, whose utility is so great
            that its destruction is prohibited by law under a
            heavy penalty. In a country where putrefaction
            is so rapid, it is of infinite consequence to preserve
            an animal which, if a <ecda:fauna>bullock</ecda:fauna> or <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> falls dead in
            the field, immediately flies to the carcass before it
            has time to corrupt, and gobbles it up before you
            can say <said rend="quotes"><ecda:fauna>John Crow</ecda:fauna>,</said> much less <persName ref="#jack_robinson_0001">Jack Robinson</persName>.
            The bite of the <ecda:fauna>black snake</ecda:fauna> is slightly venemous, 
            but that is all; as to the <ecda:fauna>great yellow one</ecda:fauna>, it is
            perfectly innoxious, and so timid that it always
            runs away from you. The only dangerous species of 
            serpent is the <ecda:fauna><distinct type="scientific">Whip-snake</distinct></ecda:fauna>, so called from its exactly
            resembling the lash of a whip, in length, thinness,
            pliability, and whiteness; but even the bite of 
            this is not mortal, except from very great neglect.
            The most beautiful tree, or, rather, group of trees,
            all to nothing, is the <ecda:flora>Bamboo</ecda:flora>, both from its verdure
            and from its elegance of form: as to the <ecda:flora>Cotton
            tree</ecda:flora>, it answers no purpose, either of ornament or 
            utility; or, rather, it is not suffered to answer any,
            since it is forbidden by law to export its down, lest
            it should hurt the fur trade in the manufacture of 
            <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #production">hats</ecda:commodity>: its only present use is to furnish the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
            with canoes, which are hollowed out of its immense 
            trunks. I am as yet so much enchanted with the 
            country, that it would require no very strong additional
            inducements to make me establish myself 
            here altogether; and in that case my first care 
         <pb n="76"/>
         <fw type="pageNum">68</fw>    
            would be to build for myself a cottage among these

           <p>As I was returning this morning from <placeName>Montego
           Bay</placeName>, about a mile from my own estate, a
           figure presented itself before me, I really think
           the most picturesque that I ever beheld: it was 
           a <rs type="person" ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">mulatto girl</rs>, born upon <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, but whom the
           <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers> of a neighbouring estate had obtained
           my permission to exchange for <ecda:anonPers>another slave</ecda:anonPers>, as
           well as two <rs type="persGroup">little children</rs>, whom she had borne to
           him; but, as yet, he has been unable to procure a
           substitute, owing to the difficulty of purchasing
           single negroes, and <persName ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">Mary Wiggins</persName> is still my slave.
           However, as she is considered as being manumitted,
           she had not dared present herself at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> on
           my arrival, lest she should have been considered as
           an intruder; but she now threw herself in my way to
           tell me how glad she was to see me, for that she
           had always thought till now (which is the general
           complaint) that <said direct="false" rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect"><emph>she had no massa</emph></distinct>;</said> and also to
           obtain a regular invitation to my negro festival tomorrow.
           By this universal complaint, it appears
           that, while <persName ref="#william_wilberforce_1759">Mr. Wilberforce</persName> is lamenting their hard 
           fate in being subject to a master, <emph rend="italic">their</emph> greatest fear
           is the not having a master whom they know; and
           that to be told by the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> of another estate 
        <pb n="77"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">69</fw>   
           that they <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">they belong to no massa</distinct></said>, is one of the most
           contemptuous reproaches that can be cast upon 
           them. Poor creatures, when they happened to
           hear on Wednesday evening that my carriage was
           ordered for <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName> the next morning, they
           fancied that I was going away for good and all,
           and came up to the house in such a hubbub, that
           my <ecda:anonPers>agent</ecda:anonPers> was obliged to speak to them, and pacify 
           them with the assurance that I should come back
           on Friday without fail.
           </p>
          <p>But to return to <persName ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">Mary Wiggins</persName>: she was much
             too pretty not to obtain her invitation to <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>;
             on the contrary, I <emph rend="italic">insisted</emph> upon her coming,
             and bade her tell her <emph rend="italic">husband</emph> that I admired his
             taste very much for having chosen her. I really
             think that her form and features were the most
             <emph rend="italic">statue-like</emph> that I ever met with: her complexion
             had no yellow in it, and yet was not brown enough
             to be dark—it was more of an ash-dove colour
             than any thing else; her teeth were admirable,
             both for colour and shape; her eyes equally mild
             and bright; and her face merely broad enough
             to give it all possible softness and grandness of
             contour: her air and countenance would have 
             suited <persName>Yarico</persName>; but she reminded me most of <persName ref="#guiseppina_grassini_1773">Grassini</persName>
             in <title rend="quotes" xml:lang="it" ref="#cimarosa_vergine">La Vergine del Sole</title>, only that <persName ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">Mary 
             Wiggins</persName> was a thousand times more beautiful, and 
             that, instead of a white robe, she wore a mixed
             dress of brown, white, and dead yellow, which
             harmonised excellently well with her complexion; 
         <pb n="78"/>
         <fw type="pageNum">70</fw> 
             while one of her beautiful arms was thrown across

             <persName ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">Mary Wiggins</persName> and an old <ecda:flora>Cotton-tree</ecda:flora> are the most

           <p>On my arrival at home, my <ecda:anonPers>agent</ecda:anonPers> made me a 
              very elegant little present of a <ecda:fauna>scorpion</ecda:fauna> and a
              couple of <ecda:fauna>centipedes</ecda:fauna>: the first was given to him,
              but the large <ecda:fauna>centipede</ecda:fauna> he had shaken out of a
              book last night, and having immediately covered
              her up in a phial of rum, he found this morning
              that she had produced a young one, which was 
              lying drowned by her side.

           <p>I find that my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> were called away from
               their attention to the works yesterday evening (for 
               the crop is now making with the greatest acticity),
               and kept up all night by a fire at a neighbouring
               estate. On these occasions, a fire-shell is blown,
               and all the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> of the adjoining plantations
               hasten to give their assistance. On this occasion
               the fire was extinguished with the loss of only <rs type="place">five
               negro houses</rs>; but this is a heavy concern to the
               poor <rs type="persGroup">negro proprietors</rs>, who have lost in it their 
               whole stock of clothes, and furniture, and finery,
               which they had been accumulating for years, and
               to which their attachment is excessive.

         <p>This was the day given to my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> as a festival
            on my arrival. A couple of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">heifers</ecda:food> were 
            slaughtered for them: they were allowed as much
            <ecda:food ana="#commodity">rum</ecda:food>, and <ecda:food ana="#commodity">sugar</ecda:food>, and noise, and dancing as they
            chose; and as to the two latter, certainly they 
            profited by the permission. About two o'clock
            they began to assemble round the house, all drest
            in their holiday clothes, which, both for <rs type="persGroup">men and 
       <pb n="82"/>
       <fw type="pageNum">74</fw>    
            women</rs>, were chiefly white; only that the <rs type="persGroup">women</rs>
            were decked out with a profusion of beads and
            corals, and gold ornaments of all descriptions; and
            that while the <rs type="persGroup">blacks</rs> wore jackets, the <rs type="persGroup">mulattoes</rs>
            general wore cloth coats; and inasmuch as they
            were all plainly clean instead of being shabbily 
            fashionable, and affected to be nothing except
            that which they really were, they looked twenty
            times more like gentlemen than nine tenths of the
            bankers' clerks who swagger up and down <placeName>Bond
            Street</placeName>. It is a custom as to the <rs type="persGroup">mulatto children</rs>,
            that the males born on an estate should never be
            employed as field negroes, but as tradesmen; the
            <rs type="persGroup">females</rs> are brought up as domestics about the 
            house. I had particularly invited <name><distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes" ana="#performance"><emph rend="italic">Mr.</emph> John-
            Canoe</distinct></name> (which I found to be the polite manner
            in which the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> spoke of him), and there 
            arrived a couple of very gay and gaudy ones. I enquired
            whether one of them was <name><distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes" ana="#performance">John-Crayfish</distinct></name>;
            But I was told that <name ana="#performance">John-Crayfish</name> was <name ana="#performance">John-Canoe's</name>
            rival and enemy, and might belong to the
            factions of <quote rend="quotes">the <name>Blues</name> and the <name>Reds</name></quote>; but on
            <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> they were all friends, and therefore 
            there were only the father and the son—<ecda:anonPers><name ana="#performance">Mr. John-Canoe, 
            senior</name></ecda:anonPers>, and <ecda:anonPers><name ana="#performance">Mr John-Canoe, Junior</name></ecda:anonPers>.
         </p>
         <p>The person who gave me this information was a 
            young mulatto carpenter, called <persName ref="#nicholas_0001">Nicholas</persName>, whom I
            had noticed in the crowd, on my first arrival,for his
            clean appearance and intelligent countenance; and
            he now begged me to notice the smaller of the two 
            <pb n="83"/>
            <fw type="pageNum">75</fw>     
            <name ana="#performance">John-Canoe</name> machines. <said rend="quotes" direct="false">To be sure,</said> he said, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">it
            was not so large nor so showy as the other, but
            then it was much better <emph rend="italic">proportioned</emph> (his own 
            word), and altogether much prettier;</said> and he said
            so much in praise of it, that I asked him whether 
            he knew the maker? and then out came the motive:
            <said rend="quotes" direct="false">Oh, yes! it was made by <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName>, who
            lived in <rs type="place">the next house</rs> to him, and worked in the
            same shop, and indeed they were just like brothers.</said>
            So I desired to see his <quote rend="italic" xml:lang="la" source="virgil_aeneid">fides Achates</quote>, and he brought 
            me as smart and intelligent a little fellow as eye
            ever beheld, who came grinning from ear to ear
            to tell me that he made every bit of the canoe
            with his own hands, and had set to work upon it
            the moment that he knew of <distinct type="dialect">massa's</distinct> coming to
            <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. And indeed it was as fine as paint, paste-
            board, gilt paper, and looking-glass could make it!
            Unluckily, the breeze being very strong blew off
            a fine glittering umbrella, surmounted with a plume
            of <ecda:fauna>John Crow</ecda:fauna> feathers, which crowned the top;
            and a little wag of a <ecda:anonPers>negro boy</ecda:anonPers> whipped it up,
            clapped it upon his head, and performed the part
            of an impromptu <name ana="#performance">Mr. John-Canoe</name> with so much
            fun and grotesqueness, that he fairly beat the original
            performers out of the pit, and carried off all
            the applause of the <rs type="persGroup">spectators</rs>, and a <seg ana="#currency">couple of my
            dollars</seg>. The <name ana="#performance">John-Canoes</name> are fitted out at the 
            expense of rich <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, who afterwards share
            the <seg ana="money">money</seg> collected from the spectators during
            their performance, alloting one share to the repre-

            senator himself; and it is usual for the master of
            the estate to give them a couple of guineas apiece.
         </p>
         <p><ecda:intSN>This <persName ref="#nicholas_0001">Nicholas</persName>, whom I mentioned, is a very interesting
            person, both from his good looks and 
            gentle manners, and from his story. He is the
            son of <ecda:anonPers>a white man</ecda:anonPers>, who on his death-bed charged
            his <ecda:anonPers>nephew</ecda:anonPers> and heir to purchase the freedom of
            this natural child. The <ecda:anonPers>nephew</ecda:anonPers> had promised to
            do so; I had consented; nothing was necessary
            but to find the substitute (which is now no easy
            matter); when about six months ago the <ecda:anonPers>nephew</ecda:anonPers> 
            broke his neck, and the property went to a <ecda:anonPers>distant
            relation</ecda:anonPers>. Application on behalf of poor <persName ref="#nicholas_0001">Nicholas</persName>
            has been made to the <ecda:anonPers>heir</ecda:anonPers>, and I heartily hope
            that he will enable me to release him. I felt
            strongly tempted to set him at liberty at once;
            but if I were to begin in that way, there would
            be no stopping; and it would be doing a kindness
            to an individual at the expense of all my other
            <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>—others would expect the same; and then
            I must either contrive to cultivate my estate 
            with fewer hands—or must cease to cultivate
            it altogether—and, from inability to maintain
            them, send my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> to seek bread for thems-
            selves—which, as two thirds of them have been
            born upon the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, and many of them are
            lame, dropsical, and of a great age, would, of all
            misfortunes that could happen to them, be the most
            cruel. Even when <persName ref="#nicholas_0001">Nicholas</persName> was speaking to me 
            about his liberty, he said, <said rend="quotes">It is not that I wish to
          <pb n="85"/>
          <fw type="pageNum">77</fw>     
            go away, sir; it is only for the name and honour of
            being free: but I would always stay here and be 
            your servant; and I had rather be an under-workman
            on <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, than a head-carpenter any where
            else.</said></ecda:intSN> Possibly, this was all palaver (in which the
            <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are great dealers), but at least he <emph rend="italic">seemed</emph>
            to be sincere; and I was heartily grieved that I
            could not allow myself to say more to him than
            that I sincerely wished him to get his liberty, and
            would receive the very lowest exchange for him
            that common prudence would authorize. And even
            for these few kind words, the poor fellow seemed
            to think it impossible to find means strong enough
            to express his gratitude. 
            </p>
         <p>Nor is this the only instance in which <persName ref="#nicholas_0001">Nicholas</persName>
            has been unlucky. It seems that he was the first 
            lover of the beautiful <persName ref="#psyche_0001">Psyche</persName>, whom I had noticed
            on my arrival. <seg ana="#performance">This evening, after the performance 
            of the <name><rs type="persGroup" ana="#performance">John-Canoes</rs></name>, I desired to see some
            of the girls dance; and by general acclamation
            <persName ref="#psyche_0001">Psyche</persName> was brought forward to exhibit, she being
            avowedly the best dancer on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>; and certainly
            nothing could be more light, graceful, easy,
            and spirited than her performance. She perfectly
            answered the description of <persName ref="#sallust_86">Sallust's</persName> <persName ref="#sempronia_0001">Sempronia</persName>,
            who was said—<quote xml:lang="la" rend="quotes" source="sallust_cataline">Saltare elegantius, quam necesse

         <p><seg ana="#performance">The dances performed to-night seldom admitted

            caprice of the moment; but I am told there is
            a regular figure, and that the least mistake, or a
            single false step, is immediately noticed by the rest.
            I could indeed sometimes fancy, that one story
            represented an old duenna guarding a girl from
            a lover; and another, the pursuit of a young woman
            by two suitors, the one young and the other old;

     <fw type="pageNum">80</fw>       
            but this might be only fancy. However, I am
            told, that they have dances which not only represent
            courtship and marriage, but being brought 
            to bed. Their music consisted of nothing but
            <distinct type="dialect">Gambys</distinct> (<rs type="properAdjective">Eboe</rs> drums), <distinct type="dialect">Shaky-shekies</distinct>, and <distinct type="dialect">Kitty
            katties</distinct>: the latter is nothing but any flat piece of
            board beat upon with two sticks, and the former is
            a blader with a parcel of pebbles in it. But the
            principal part of the music to which they dance is
            vocal; one girl generally singing two lines by
            herself, and being answered by a chorus. To 
            make out either the rhyme of the air, or meaning
            of the words, was out of the question. But one 
            very long song was about the <persName ref="#arthur_wellesley_1769">Duke of Wellington</persName>,
            every stanza being chorussed with,
            <quote rend="quotes"><lg type="song"><l>Ay! hey-day! <placeName>Waterloo</placeName>!</l>
            <l><placeName>Waterloo</placeName>! ho! ho! ho!</l></lg></quote>
            <emph rend="italic">I</emph> too had a great deal to do in the business, for

         </p>
         <p>The singing began about six o'clock, and lasted 
            without a moment's pause till two in the morning;
            and such noise never did I hear till then. The

            dancers</rs> was, through every part of the house except
            the bed-rooms, occupied by men, women,
            and children, fast asleep. But although they were

            was not one one of them drunk; except indeed, one

            and shouted, and tossed herself about in an elbow
            chair, till she tumbled it over, and rolled about
            the room in a manner which shocked the delicacy
            of even the least prudish part of the company.
            At twelve, <ecda:anonPers>my agent</ecda:anonPers> wanted to dismiss them; but

         <p>In spite of their exertions of last night, the
            <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> were again with me by two o'clock in the 
            day, with their drums and their chorusses. However,
            they found themselves unable to keep it up
            as they had done on the former night, and were
            content to withdraw to <rs type="place">their own houses</rs> by ten in
            the evening. But first they requested to have tomorrow
            to themselves, in order that they might
            go to the <rs type="place">mountains</rs> for provisions. For although
            <rs type="place">their cottages</rs> are always surrounded with <ecda:flora>trees</ecda:flora>
            and <ecda:flora>shrubs</ecda:flora>, their <rs type="place" ana="#food #cultivation">provision grounds</rs> are kept quite
            distinct, and are at a distance among the <rs type="place">mountains</rs>.
            Of course, I made no difficulty of aceding 
            to their request, but upon condition, that they 
            should ask for no more holidays till the crop

            vating their <rs type="place">provision-grounds</rs>, they are allowed
            every Saturday; but on the occasion of my arrival,
            they obtained permission to have the Saturday to
            themselves, and to fetch their week's provisions
            from the mountains on the following Monday. All
            the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs> maintain themselves in this manner by
            their own labour; even the <rs type="persGroup">domestic attendants</rs>
            are not exempted, but are expected to feed them-
            selves, except stated allowances of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt fish</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#commodity">salt

         <p>I really believe that the negresses can produce
            children at pleasure; and where they are barren, it 
            is just as hens will frequently not lay eggs on ship-

            <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina's</persName> <ecda:anonPers>wife</ecda:anonPers> is in a family way, and I told him

            I think nobody will be able to accuse me of

            for I have not only promised to baptize all the infants,
            but, meeting a little black boy this morning,
            who said that his name was <persName ref="#moses_0001">Moses</persName>, I gave him a
            piece of silver, and told him that it was for the

           <p>In my evening's drive I met the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, returning
             from the <rs type="place">mountains</rs>, with baskets of provisions
             sufficient to last them for the week. By 
             law they are only allowed every other Saturday for
             the purpose of cultivating their own <rs type="place">grounds</rs>,
             which, indeed, is sufficient; but by giving them
             every alternate Saturday into the bargain, it enables 
             them to perform their task with so much
             ease as almost converts it into an amusement; and
             the frequent visiting <rs type="place">their grounds</rs> makes them grow
             habitually as much attached to them as they are to
             <rs type="place">their houses</rs> and gardens. It is also adviseable for
             them to bring home only a week's provisions at a
             time, rather than a fortnight's; for they are so
             thoughtless and improvident, that, when they find
             themselves in a possession of a larger supply than is
             requisite for their immediate occasions, they will
             sell half to the wandering higglers, or at <placeName>Savanna
             la Mar</placeName>, in exchange for spirits; and then, at the
             end of the week, they find themselves entirely unprovided 
             with food, and come to beg a supply from
             the master's storehouse.

    <p>The houses here are generally built and arranged
       according to one and the same model. My own is
       of wood, partly raised upon pillars; it consists of
       a single floor: a long gallery, called a <distinct>piazza</distinct>, terminated
       at each end by a square room, runs the
       whole length of the house. On each side of the
       piazza is a range of bed-rooms, and the porticoes of
       the two fronts form two more rooms, with balustrades,
       and flights of steps descending to the lawn.
       The whole house is virandoed with shifting <rs type="properAdjective">Venetian</rs>
       blinds to admit air; except that one of the
       end rooms has sash-windows on account of the
       rains, which, when they arrive, are so heavy, and
       shift with the wind so suddenly from the one side
       to the other, that all the blinds are obliged to be
       kept closed; consequently the whole house is in
       total darkness during their continuance, except the
       single sash-windowed room. There is nothing underneath
       except a few store-rooms and a kind of

    </p>
     <p><placeName>Cornwall House</placeName> itself stands on a dead flat, and
        the works are built in its immediate neighbourhood,
        for the convenience of their being the more
        under the <ecda:anonPers>agent's</ecda:anonPers> personal inspection (a point of
        material consequence with them all, but more particularly
        for the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>). This dead flat is only

        of a small river, which turns the mill. Several of

        its stench, and its dirty accompaniments.

    <p>I saw the whole process of <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #flora #food">sugar-making</ecda:commodity> this 
       morning. The ripe <ecda:commodity ana="#flora #cultivation">canes</ecda:commodity> are brought in bundles
       to the mill, where <rs type="persGroup">the cleanest of the women</rs> are
       appointed, one to put them into the machines for
       grinding them, and another to draw them out after
       the juice has been extracted, when she throws them
       into an opening in the floor close to her; another
       band of <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> collects them below, when, under
       the name of <ecda:commodity ana="#flora #refining"><distinct type="agricultural" rend="italic">trash</distinct></ecda:commodity>, they are carried away to serve
       for fuel. The <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #flora">juice</ecda:commodity>, which is itself of a pale
       ash-colour, gushes out in great streams, quite white 
   <pb n="95"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">87</fw>  
       with foam, and passes through a wooden gutter
       into the <rs type="place">boiling-house</rs>, where it is received into the
       siphon or <distinct type="agricultural" rend="quotes">cock copper</distinct>, where fire is applied to
       it, and it is slaked with <ecda:commodity ana="#refining">lime</ecda:commodity>, in order to make it
       granulate. The feculent parts of it rise to the top,
       while the purer and more fluid flow through another
       gutter into the second copper. When little but
       the impure scum on the surface remains to be 
       drawn off, the first gutter communicating with the
       copper is stopped, and the grosser parts are obliged
       to find a new course through another gutter, which
       conveys them to the distillery, where, being mixed
       with the <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">molasses</ecda:commodity>, or <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">treacle</ecda:commodity>, they are manufactured
       into <ecda:commodity ana="#food">rum</ecda:commodity>. From the second copper they are transmitted 
       into the first, and thence into two others,
       and in these four latter basins the scum is removed
       with skimmers pierced with holes, till it becomes
       sufficiently free from impurities to be <distinct type="agricultural" rend="italic">skipped</distinct> off,
       that is, to be again ladled out of the coppers and
       spread into the coolers, where it is left to granulate.
       The <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">sugar</ecda:commodity> is then formed, and is removed into the
       <rs type="place"><distinct type="agricultural" rend="italic">curing-house</distinct></rs>, where it is put into hogsheads, and
       left to settle for a certain time, during which those
       parts which are too poor and too liquid to granulate,
       drip from the casks into vessels placed beneath
       them: these drippings are the <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">molasses</ecda:commodity>,
       which, being carried into the distillery, and mixed
       with the coarser scum formerly mentioned, form
       that mixture from which the spirituous liquor of 
       <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">sugar</ecda:commodity> is afterwards produced by fermentation:
   <pb n="96"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">88</fw>   
       when but once distilled, it is called <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food"><distinct type="agricultural" rend="quotes">low wine</distinct></ecda:commodity>;
       and it is not till after it has gone through a second
       distillation, that it acquires the name of <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">rum</ecda:commodity>. The
       <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #flora"><distinct type="agricultural" rend="quotes">trash</distinct></ecda:commodity> used for fuel consists of the empty <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #refining">canes</ecda:flora>,
       that which is employed for fodder and for thatching
       is furnished by the superabundant <ecda:flora ana="#commodity">cane-tops</ecda:flora>;
       after so many have been set aside as are required
       for planting. After these original plants have been 
       cut, their roots throw up suckers, which, in time,
       become <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">canes</ecda:flora>, and are called <ecda:flora ana="#cultivation"><distinct type="agricultural" rend="italic">ratoons</distinct></ecda:flora>: they are far
       inferior in juice to the planted <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">canes</ecda:flora>; but then, on
       the other hand, they require much less weeding,
       and spare the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> the only laborious part of
       the business of <ecda:commodity ana="#food">sugar</ecda:commodity>-making, the digging holes for
       the <ecda:flora ana="#plant #commodity">plants</ecda:flora>; therefore, although <measure>an acre</measure> of <ecda:flora ana="#cultivation #commodity">ratoons</ecda:flora> 
       will produce but <measure>one hogshead</measure> of <ecda:commodity ana="#refining #food">sugar</ecda:commodity>, while <measure>an
       acre</measure> of <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">plants</ecda:flora> will produce two, the superiority of
       the ratooned piece is very great, inasmuch as the
       saving of time and labour will enable the proprietor
       to cultivate <measure>five acres</measure> of <ecda:flora ana="#cultivation #commodity">ratoons</ecda:flora> in the same time
       with one of <ecda:flora ana="#cultivation #commodity">plants</ecda:flora>. Unluckily, after three crops,
       or five at the utmost, in general the <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #harvest">ratoons</ecda:flora> are
       totally exhausted, and you are obliged to have recourse
       to fresh <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">plants</ecda:flora>.

      <p>Last night a poor man, named <persName ref="#charles_0001">Charles</persName>, who had
         been coachman to <rs type="person">my uncle</rs> ages ago, was brought
         into the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, having missed a step in the <rs type="place">boiling-house</rs>,
         and plunged his foot into the siphon:
         fortunately, the fire had not long been kindled, and
         though the liquor was hot enough to scald him, it
   <pb n="97"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">89</fw>  
        was not sufficiently so to do him any material injury. 
        The old man had presented himself to me on
        Saturday's holiday (or <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">play-day</distinct>, in the negro dialect),
         and had shown me, with great exultation, the
         coat and waistcoat which had been the last present
         of his <rs type="person">old <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct></rs>. <persName ref="#charles_0001">Charles</persName> is now my chief mason,
         and, as one of the principal persons on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>,
         was entitled, by old custom, to the compliment of 
         a <emph rend="italic">distinguishing</emph> <measure ana="#currency">dollar</measure> <mcr rend="italic">on</mcr> my arrival; but at the
         same time I gave him the <measure ana="#currency">dollar</measure>, to which his
         situation entitled him, I gave him another for him-
         self, as a keepsake: he put it in the pocket of
         <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">his <rs type="person">old massa's</rs></distinct></said> waistcoat, and assured me that
         they should never again be separated. On hearing
         of his accident, I went over to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> to
         see that he was well taken care of; and immediately
         the poor fellow began talking to me about
         <rs type="person">my grandfather</rs>, and his <rs type="person">young <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct></rs>, and the
         <rs type="persGroup">young misses, his sisters</rs>, and while I suffered him to
         chatter away for an hour, he totally forgot the pain
         of his burnt leg.         
       </p>
      <p>It was particularly agreeable to me to observe,
         on Saturday, as a proof of the good treatment
         which they had experienced, so many <rs type="persGroup">old servants</rs>
         of the family, many of whom had been born
         on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, and who, though turned of sixty
         and seventy, were still strong, healthy, and cheerful.
         Many manumitted <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, also, came from
         other parts of the country to this festival, on hearing
         of my arrival, because, as they said,—<said direct="false" rend="quotes">if they
   <pb n="98"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">90</fw>     
         did not come to see <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>, they were afraid it
         would look ungrateful, and as if they cared no
         longer about him and <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, now that they
         were free.</said> So they stayed two or three days on
         the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, coming up to the house for their dinners,
         and going to sleep at night among <rs type="persGroup">their friends</rs> in
         their own former habitations, the <rs type="place">negro huts</rs>; and
         when they went away, they assured me, that nothing 
         should prevent their coming back to bid me fare-
         well, before I left the island. All this may be
         palaver; but certainly they at least play their parts
         with such an air of truth, and warmth, and enthusiasm,
         that, after the cold hearts and repulsive manners
         of <placeName>England</placeName>, the contrast is infinitely agreeable.
         <quote rend="quotes" xml:lang="fr">Je ne vois que des yeux toujours prêts à sourire</quote>
      </p>
      <p>I find it quite impossible to resist the fascination
         of the conscious pleasure of pleasing; and my own
         heart, which I have so long been obliged to keep
         closed, seems to expand itself again in the sunshine
         of the kind looks and words which meet me
         at every turn, and seem to wait for mine as
         anxiously as if they were so many diamonds.

    <p>In the year <date when="1880">'80</date>, this parish of <placeName>Westmoreland</placeName>
       was kept in a perpetual state of alarm by a runaway
       negro called <persName rend="italic" ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName>, who had established him-
       self among the <geogName>Moreland Mountains</geogName>, and collected 
       a troop of banditti, of which he was himself the 
 <pb n="99"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">91</fw>  
       chief. He robbed very often, and murdered occasionally;
       but gallantry was his every day occupation.
       Indeed, being a remarkably tall athletic
       young fellow, among the beauties of his own complexion
       he found but few <name>Lucretias</name>; and his retreat
       in the mountains was as well furnished as 
       the haram of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>. Every handsome
       negress who had the slightest cause of complaint
       against her master, took the first opportunity of
       eloping to join <persName rend="italic" ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName>, where she found freedom,
       protection, and unbounded generosity; for he
       spared no pains to secure their affections by gratifying
       their vanity. Indeed, no <rs type="properAdjective">Creole</rs> lady could
       venture out on a visit, without running the risk of
       having her bandbox run away with by <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName> for
       the decoration of <rs type="persGroup">his sultanas</rs>; and if the maid who
       carried the bandbox happened to be well-looking, he 
       ran away with the maid as well as the bandbox. 
       Every endeavour to seize this desperado was long
       in vain: a large reward was put upon his head, but
       no negro dared to approach him; for, besides his 
       acknowledged courage, he was a professor of <distinct type="religious">Obi</distinct>,
       and had threatened that whoever dared to lay a 
       finger upon him should suffer spiritual torments,
       as well as be physically shot through the head.
       </p>
    <p>Unluckily for <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName>, <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food> was an article with him
       of the first necessity; the look-out, which was kept 
       for him, was too vigilant to admit of his purchasing
       spirituous liquors for himself; and once, when for
       that purpose he had ventured into the neighbour-
 <pb n="100"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">92</fw>     
       hood of <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName>, he was recognised by a slave,
       who immediately gave the alarm. Unfortunately
       for this poor fellow, whose name was <persName ref="#taffy_0001">Taffy</persName>, at that
       moment all his companions happened to be out of
       hearing; and, after the first moment's alarm, finding 
       that no one approached, the exasperated robber
       rushed upon him, and lifted the bill-hook, with
       which he was armed, for the purpoe of cleaving his
       skull. <persName ref="#taffy_0001">Taffy</persName> fled for it; but <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName> was the younger,
       the stronger, and the swifter of the two, and gained 
       upon him at every moment. <persName ref="#taffy_0001">Taffy</persName>, however, on the
       other hand, possessed that one quality by which,
       according to the fable, the <ecda:fauna>cat</ecda:fauna> was enabled to save
       herself from the <ecda:fauna>hounds</ecda:fauna>, when the <ecda:fauna>fox</ecda:fauna>, with his
       thousand tricks, was caught by them. He was an 
       admirable climber, an art in which <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName> possessed
       no skill; and a <ecda:flora ana="#food">bread-nut tree</ecda:flora>, which is remarkably 
       difficult of ascent, presenting itself before him, in
       a few moments <persName ref="#taffy_0001">Taffy</persName> was bawling for help from
       the very top of it. To reach him was impossible 
       for his enemy; but still his destruction was hard at 
       hand; for <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName> began to hack the tree with his
       bill, and it was evident that a very short space of
       time would be sufficient to level it with the ground.
       In this dilemma, <persName ref="#taffy_0001">Taffy</persName> had nothing for it but to
       break off the branches near him; and he contrived
       to pelt these so dexterously at the head of his
       assailant, that he fairly kept him at bay till his
       cries at length reached the ears of his companions,
       and their approach compelled the banditti-captain
       once more to seek safety among the mountains. 
    </p> 
  <pb n="101"/>
  <fw type="pageNum">93</fw>   
      <p>After this <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName> no longer dared to approach
     <placeName>Montego town</placeName>; but still <ecda:food>spirits</ecda:food> must be had:—how
       was he to obtain them? There was an <ecda:anonPers>old watch-
       man</ecda:anonPers> on the outskirts of the estate of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, with
       whom he had contracted an acquaintance, and frequently
       had passed the night in <rs type="place">his hut</rs>; the old 
       man having been equally induced by his presents
       and by dread of his corporeal strength and supposed
       supernatural power, to profess the warmest attachment
       to the interests of his terrible friend. To this
       man <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName> at length resolved to entrust himself: he
       gave him <seg ana="#money">money</seg> to purchase spirits, and appointed
       a particular day when he would come to receive
       them. The reward placed upon the robber's head
       was more than either gratitude or terror could
       counterbalance; and at the same day when the
       <ecda:anonPers>watchman</ecda:anonPers> set out to purchase the <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food>, he apprised
       <rs type="persGroup">two of his friends</rs> at <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, for whose use it was
       intended, and advised <emph rend="italic">them</emph> to take the opportunity
       of obtaining the reward.         
      </p>
      <p>The <rs type="persGroup">two negroes</rs> posted themselves in proper 
         time near the <ecda:anonPers>watchman's</ecda:anonPers> hut. Most unwisely,
         instead of sending down some of <rs type="persGroup">his gang</rs>, they 
         saw <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato</persName>, in his full confidence in the friendship
         of his confidant, arrive himself and enter the <rs type="place">cabin</rs>; 
         but so great was their alarm at seeing this dreadful
         personage, that they remained in their concealment,
         nor dared to make an attempt at seizing him.
         The <ecda:food>spirits</ecda:food> were delivered to the robber: he might
         have retired with them unmolested; but, in his 
         
<pb n="102"/>
<fw type="pageNum">94</fw> 
         rashness and his eagerness to taste the <ecda:food>liquor</ecda:food>, of
         which he had been so long deprived, he opened the
         flagon, and swallowed draught after draught, till he
         sunk upon the ground in a state of complete insensibility.
         The <ecda:anonPers>watchman</ecda:anonPers> then summoned the <rs type="persGroup">two
         negroes</rs> from their concealment, who bound his
         arms, and conveyed him to <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName>, where <seg ana="#punishment">he
         was immediately sentenced to execution</seg>. <seg ana="#obeah">He died
         most heroically; kept up the terrors of his imposture
         to the last moment; he told the <rs type="persGroup">magistrates</rs>, who
         condemned thim, that his death should be revenged
         by a storm, which would lay waste to the whole <rs type="place">island</rs>,
         that year; and, when his <ecda:anonPers>negro gaoler</ecda:anonPers> was binding
         him to the stake at which he was destined to suffer,
         he assured him that he should not live long to
         triumph in his death, for that he had taken good
         care to Obeah him before his quitting the prison.
         It certainly did happen, strangely enough, that, 
         before the year was over, the most violent storm
         took place ever known in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; and as to the
         <ecda:anonPers>gaoler</ecda:anonPers>, his imagination was so forcibly struck by
         the threats of the dying man, that, although every
         care was taken of him, the power of medicine exhausted, 
         and even a voyage to <placeName>America</placeName> undertaken,
         in hopes that a change of scene might
         change the course of his ideas, still, from the
         moment of <persName ref="#plato_0001">Plato's</persName> death, he gradually pined and
         withered away, and finally expired before the

          their complement of <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> decreased, and having

          and sometimes twice, in order that I might be certain
          of the <rs type="persGroup">women</rs> being well taken care of; not a
          day passed without the inspection of <rs type="person">a physician</rs>;
          nothing of indulgence, that was proper for them,
          was denied; and, besides their ordinary <ecda:food>food</ecda:food>, the
          mothers received every day the most nourishing and
          palatable <ecda:food>dish</ecda:food> that was brought to my own table.
          Add to this, that the <rs type="persGroup">women</rs> themselves were kindhearted
          creatures, and particularly anxious to rear
          <rs type="persGroup">these children</rs>, because I had promised to be their
          godfather myself. Yet, in spite of all this attention
          and indulgence, <ecda:anonPers>one of the mothers</ecda:anonPers>, during
          the nurse's absence for ten minutes, grew alarmed
          at her <ecda:anonPers>infant's</ecda:anonPers> apparent sleepiness. To rouse it,
          she began dancing and shaking it till it was in a 
          strong perspiration, and then she stood with it for
          some minutes at an open window, while a strong 
          north wind was blowing. In consequence, it
          caught cold, and the next morning symptoms of 
    <pb n="105"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">97</fw>      
          a locked jaw showed itself. The <ecda:anonPers>poor woman</ecda:anonPers> was
          the image of grief itself: she sat on her bed,
          looking at the <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> which lay by her side with its
          little hands clasped, its teeth clenched, and its eyes
          fixed, writhing in the agony of the spasm, while
          she was herself quite motionless and speechless,
          although the tears trickled down her cheeks incessantly.
          All assistance was fruitless: her thoughtlessness
          for five minutes had killed the <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers>, and,
          at noon to-day it expired. 
       </p>
       <p><ecda:anonPers>This woman</ecda:anonPers> was a tender mother, had borne <rs type="persGroup">ten
          children</rs>, and yet has now but one alive: <ecda:anonPers>another</ecda:anonPers>, 
          at present in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, has borne seven, and
          but one has lived to puberty; and the instances
          of those who have had four, five, six children,
          without succeeding in bringing up one, in spite
          of the utmost attention and indulgence, are very
          numerous; so heedless and inattentive are the
          best-intentioned mothers, and so subject in this
          climate are infants to dangerous complaints. The
          locked jaw is the common and most fatal one; so
          fatal, indeed, that the <ecda:anonPers>midwife</ecda:anonPers> (the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">graundee</distinct> is her
          negro appellation) told me, the other day, <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Oh,
          massa, till nine days are over, we <emph rend="italic">no hope</emph> of them</distinct>.</said>
          Certainly care and kindness are not adequate to
          save the children, for the son of a sovereign could 
          not have been more anxiously well treated than
          was the <ecda:anonPers>poor little negro</ecda:anonPers> who died this morning. 
       </p>
       <p>The <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are always buried in their own gardens,
          and many strange and fantastical ceremonies
    <pb n="106"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">98</fw>      
          are observed on the occasion. If the corpse be 
          that of a grown person, they consult it as to which
          way it pleases to be carried; and they make attempts
          upon various roads without success, before
          they can hit upon the right one. Till that is accomplished,
          they stagger under the weight of the 
          coffin, struggle against its force, which draws them
          in a different direction form that which they had
          settled to go; and sometimes in the contest the
          corpse and the coffin jump off the shoulders of the
          bearers. But if, as is frequently the case, any person
          is suspected of having hastened the catastrophe, the
          corpse will then refuse to go any road but the one
          which passes by the habitation of the suspected 
          person, and as soon as it approaches his house, no
          human power is equal to persuading it to pass. 
          As the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are extremely superstitious, and
          very much afraid of ghosts (whom they call the
          <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">duppy</distinct>), I rather wonder at their choosing to have
          their dead buried in their gardens; but I understand
          their argument to be, that they need only fear
          the <distinct type="dialect">duppies</distinct> of their enemies, but have nothing to apprehend
          from those after death who loved them in
          their lifetime; but the <distinct type="dialect">duppies</distinct> if their adversaries
          are very alarming beings, equally powerful by day as
          by night, and who not only are spiritually terrific, but
          who can give very hard substantial knocks on the 
          pate, whenever they see fit occasion, and can find a
          good opportunity.

         <p>Last Saturday <ecda:anonPers>a negro</ecda:anonPers> was brought into the hos-
            
   <pb n="107"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">99</fw>    
            pital, having fallen into epileptic fits, with which 
            till then he had never been troubled. As the
            faintings had seized him at the <rs type="place">slaughter-house</rs>,
            and the fellow was an <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs>, it was at first supposed
            by <rs type="persGroup">his companions</rs>, that the sight and smell
            of the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">meat</ecda:food> had affected him; for many of the
            <name>Africans</name> cannot endure <ecda:food ana="#fauna">animal food</ecda:food> of any kind,
            and most of the <name>Ebres</name> in particular are made ill by
            eating <ecda:food ana="#fauna">turtle</ecda:food>, even although they can use any other
            food without injury. However, upon enquiry
            among <rs type="persGroup">his shipmates</rs>, it appeared that he had 
            frequently eaten <ecda:food ana="#fauna">beef</ecda:food> without the slightest inconvenience.
            For my own part, the symptoms of 
            his complaint were such as to make me suspect
            him of having tasted something poisonous, especially as,
            just before his first fit, he had been observed
            in the <rs type="place">small grove</rs>of <ecda:flora ana="#food">mangoes</ecda:flora> near <rs type="place">the
            house</rs>; but I was assured by the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, one and 
            all, that nothing could possibly have induced him
            to eat an <ecda:food ana="#flora">herb</ecda:food> or <ecda:food ana="#flora">fruit</ecda:food> from <rs type="place">that grove</rs>, as it had
            been used as a burying-ground for <said rend="quotes">the white
            people</said>. But although my idea of the poison was 
            scouted, still the mention of the <rs type="place">burying-ground </rs>
            suggested another cause for his illness to the 
            <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, and they had no sort of doubt, that in
            passing through the <rs type="place">burying-ground</rs> he had been
            struck down by the <distinct type="dialect">duppy</distinct> of a white person not
            long deceased, whom he had formerly offended,
            and that these repeated fainting-fits were the
            consequence of that ghostly blow. The <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> 
       <pb n="108"/>
       <fw type="pageNum">100</fw>      
            have in various publications been accused of a
            total want of religion, but this appears to me quite
            incompatible with the ideas of spirits existing
            after dissolution of the body, which necessarily
            implies a belief in a future state; and although
            (as far as I can make out) they have no outward 
            forms of religion, the most devout <name>Christian</name> cannot
            have <quote rend="quotes">God bless you</quote> oftener on his lips than
            the negro; nor, on the other hand, appear to feel
            the wish for their enemy's damnation more sincerely
            when he utters it.         
         </p>
         <p>The <name>Africans</name> (as it is well known) generally believe,
            that there is a life beyond this world, and
            that they shall enjoy it by returning to their own
            country; and this idea used frequently to induce
            them, soon after their landing in the <rs type="place">colonies</rs>, to
            commit suicide; but this was never known to 
            take place except among fresh <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, and since
            the execrable slave-trade has been abolished, such
            an illusion is unheard of. As to those who had 
            once got over the dreadful period of <distinct rend="quotes" type="economic">seasoning</distinct>,
            they were generally soon sensible enough of the
            amelioration of their condition, to make the idea
            of returning to <placeName>Africa</placeName> the most painful that could
            be presented to them. But, to be sure, poor
            creatures! what with the terrors and sufferings of
            the voyage, and the unavoidable hardships of <distinct type="economic">the
            seasoning</distinct>, those advantages were purchased more
            dearly than any in this life can possibly be worth.
            God be thanked, all this is now at an end; and

            certainly, as far as I can yet judge, if I were
            now standing on the bank of <persName ref="#virgil_0070">Virgil's</persName> <placeName>Lethe</placeName>, with a
            goblet of the waters of oblivion in my hand, and
            asked whether I chose to enter life anew as an
            <rs  type="properAdjective">English</rs> labourer or a <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> negro, I should have
            no hesitation in preferring the latter. For myself,
            it appears to me almost worth surrendering the luxuries
            and pleasures of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, for the single
            pleasure of being surrounded with beings who are
            always laughing and singing, and who seem to perform
            their work with so much <emph rend="italic">nonchalance</emph>, taking
            up their baskets as if it were perfectly optional whether
            they took them up or left them there; sauntering
            along with their hands dangling; stopping to 
            to chat with every one they meet; or if they meet
            no one, standing to look round, and examine
            whether there is nothing to be seen that can
            amuse them, so that I can hardly persuade myself
            that it is really <emph rend="italic">work</emph> that they are about. The
            negro might well say, on his arrival in <placeName>England</placeName>
            —<said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Massa, in <placeName>England</placeName> every thing work</distinct>!</said> for
            here nobody appears to work at all.
         </p>
         <p>I am told that there is one part of their business
            very laborious, the digging holes for receiving the
            <ecda:flora ana="#plant #commodity">cane-plants</ecda:flora>, and which I have not as yet seen; but
            this does not occupy above a month (I believe) at
            the utmost, at two periods of the year; and on
            my estate this service is chiefly performed by extra
            <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, hired for the purpose; which, although
            equally hard on the hired <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> (called a <distinct type="economic">jobbing

            gang</distinct>, at least relieves my own, and after all, puts
            even the former on much the same footing with

         </p>
         <p>But if I could be contented to <emph rend="italic">live</emph> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>,
            I am still more certain, that it is the only agreeable
            place for me to die in; for I have got a family
            mausoleum, which looks for all the world like the
            theatrical representation of the <quote rend="quotes">tomb of all the
            Capulets</quote>. Its outside is most plentifully decorated
            <quote rend="quotes" source="parnell_death">with sculptured stones</quote>,—
            <quote rend="quotes" source="parnell_death">Arms, angels, epitaphs, and bones</quote>.
            Within is a tomb of purest white marble, raised
            on a platform of ebony; the building, which is
            surmounted by a statue of <name>Time</name>, with his scythe
            and hour-glass, stands in the very heart of an 
            <ecda:flora ana="#food">orange grove</ecda:flora>, now in full bearing; and the whole
            scene this morning looked so cool, so tranquil, and
            so gay, and is so perfectly divested of all vestiges 
            of dissolution, that the sight of it gave me an
            appetite for being buried. It is a matter of perfect
            indifference to me what becomes of this little
            ugly husk of mine, when once I shall have <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_hamlet">shuffled

            follow <rs type="person">my grandfather's</rs> example, and, die where I 
            might, order my body to be sent over for burial to
            <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>; for I never yet saw a place where one
            could lie down more comfortably to listen for the

            the most singular and exquisite flavour, perhaps, is
            to be found in the <ecda:food ana="#flora">granadillo</ecda:food>, a fruit which grows
            upon a species of vine, and, in fact, appears to be
            a kind of <ecda:food ana="#flora">cucumber</ecda:food>. It must be suffered to hang
            till it is dead ripe, when it is scarcely any thing except
            juice and seeds, which can only be eaten with
            a spoon. It requires <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food>, but the acid is truly
            delicous, and like no other separate flavour that I

         <p>As to fish, <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName> is reckoned the best

            that their names equalled their flesh in taste; for it

            died of eating too many <ecda:food ana="#fauna">lampreys</ecda:food>; though, to own
            the truth, it was suspected that the monks, in an instance
            or two, improved the same by the addition 
            of a little ratsbane; and <persName ref="#honore_riqueti_1749">Mirabeau</persName> assures us, that
            <persName ref="#frederick_the_great_1712">Frederick the Second of <placeName>Prussia</placeName></persName> might have prolonged
            his existence, if he could but have resisted

            strong for him, and, like his great-grandmother of

            the bishops: those clergymen who reside constantly
            on their livings (as all clergymen ought to do, or
            they ought not to be clergymen), I shall, in charity,
            believe to have something better to do with their

            and they remain in great perfection for many
            months, provided they are dug up carefully, but the
            slightest wound with the spade is sufficient to rot
            them. <ecda:food ana="#flora"><distinct type="agricultural">Catalue</distinct></ecda:food> (a species of <ecda:food ana="#flora">spinach</ecda:food>) is a principal
            article in their <ecda:food>pepper-pots</ecda:food>; but in this parish their
            most valuable and regular supply of food arises from
            the <ecda:food ana="#flora">cocoa-finger</ecda:food>, or <ecda:food ana="#flora"><distinct type="agricultural">coccos</distinct></ecda:food>, a species of the <ecda:food ana="#flora">yam</ecda:food>,
            but which lasts all year round. These vegetables
            form the basis of negro sustenance; but the slaves
            also receive from their owners a regular weekly
            allowance of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">red herrings</ecda:food> and <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt meat</ecda:food>, which
            serves to relish their vegetable diet; and, indeed,
            they are so passionately fond of salted provisions,
            that, instead of giving them <ecda:food ana="#fauna">fresh beef</ecda:food> (as at their

            provides some <measure>hogsheads</measure> of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt fish</ecda:food>, as likely to
            afford them more gratification, at such future additional

          but, as far as the most positive assurances can go,
          since my arrival in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I have reason to believe
          the contrary, and that mulattoes breed together
          just as well as blacks and whites; but they
          are almost universally weak and effeminate persons,
          and thus their children are very difficult to rear.
          On a sugar estate one black is considered as more
          than equal to two mulattoes. Beautiful as are their
          forms in general, and easy and graceful as are their
          movements (which, indeed, appear to me so striking,
          that they cannot fail to excite the admiration
          of any one who has ever looked with delight on

          one of the most requisite points of female beauty.

        <p>I never witnessed on the stage a scene so pituresque
           as a <rs type="place">negro village</rs>. I walked through my 
           own to-day, and visited the <rs type="place">houses</rs> of the drivers,
           and other principal persons; and if I were to decide
           according to my own taste, I should infinitely
           have preferred their habitation to my own. Each
           house is surrounded by a separate garden, and the
           whole village is intersected by lanes, bordered with
      <pb n="116"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">108</fw>    
           all kinds of sweet-smelling and flowering plants;
           but not such gardens as those belonging to our
           <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> cottages, where a few <ecda:flora ana="#food">cabbages</ecda:flora> and <ecda:flora ana="#food">carrots</ecda:flora>
           just peep up and grovel on the earth between
           <ecda:flora>hedges</ecda:flora>, in square narrow beds, and where the
           tallest tree is a <ecda:flora ana="#food">gooseberry bush</ecda:flora>: the <ecda:food ana="#flora">vegetables</ecda:food> of 
           the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are all cultivated in their <rs type="place">provision-
           grounds</rs>; these form their <mcr rend="italic">kitchen</mcr>-gardens, and
           these are all for ornament or luxury, and are filled
           with a profusion of <ecda:flora ana="#food">oranges</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">shaddocks</ecda:flora>, <ecda:flora ana="#food">cocoa-nuts</ecda:flora>,
           and <ecda:flora ana="#food">peppers</ecda:flora> of all descriptions: in particular I
           was shown the <ecda:flora ana="#food"><distinct type="agricultural">abba</distinct></ecda:flora>, or <ecda:flora ana="#food">palm-tree</ecda:flora>, resembling the
           <ecda:flora ana="#food">cocoa-tree</ecda:flora>, but much more beautiful, as its leaves
           are larger and more numerous, and, feathering to
           the ground as they grow old, they form a kind of
           natural arbour. It bears a large fruit, or rather
           vegetable, towards the top of the tree, in shape
           like the  cone of the <ecda:flora>pine</ecda:flora>, but formed of seeds,
           some scarlet and bright as <ecda:fauna>coral</ecda:fauna>, others of a
           brownish-red or purple. The <ecda:flora ana="#food">abba</ecda:flora> requires a 
           length of years to arrive at maturity: a very fine
           one, which was shown to me this morning, was supposed
           to be upwards of a an hundred years old; and
           one of very moderate size had been planted at the 
           least twenty years, and had only borne fruit once.
          </p>
         <p>It appears to me a strong proof of the good
            treatment which the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> on <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> 
            have been accustomed to receive, that there are many
            very old people upon it; I saw to-day <ecda:anonPers>a woman</ecda:anonPers>
            near a hundred years of age; and I am told that 
      <pb n="117"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">109</fw> 
            there are several of sixty, seventy, and eighty. I 
            was glad, also, to find that <rs type="persGroup">several negroes</rs> who
            have obtained their freedom, and possess little properties
            of their own in the mountains, and at <placeName>Savannah
            la Mar</placeName>, look upon my estate so little as the
            scene of their former sufferings while slaves, that 
            they frequently come down to pass a few days in 
            their ancient habitations with their former companions,
            by way of relaxation. <ecda:anonPers>One woman</ecda:anonPers> in 
            particular expressed her hopes, that I should not
            be offended at her still coming to <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> now
            and then, although she belonged to it no longer;
            and begged me to give directions before my return
            to <placeName>England</placeName>, that her visits should not be hindered
            on the grounds of her having no business there.
          </p>
          <p>My visit to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> has at least produced one
            advantage to myself. <rs type="persGroup">Several runaways</rs>, who had
            disappeared for some time (some for even several 
            months), have again made their appearance in the 
            field, and I have desired that no questions should
            be asked. On the other hand, after enjoying her-
            self during the Saturday and Sunday, which were
            allowed for holidays on my arrival, one of my
            ladies chose to <distinct type="economic" rend="italic">pull foot</distinct>, and did not return from
            her hiding-place in the mountains till this morning.
            Her name is <persName ref="#marcia_0001">Marcia</persName>; but she is so unlike <persName ref="#joseph_addison_1672">Addison's</persName>
            <persName ref="#marcia_0002">Marcia</persName>, that she is not only as black as <persName ref="#juba_0085">Juba</persName>,

             her disappearance she alleged, that so far was <ecda:anonPers>her
             husband</ecda:anonPers> from thinking that <quote rend="quotes" source="addison_cato">she towered above
             her sex</quote>, that he had called her <said rend="quotes">a very bad

             she could not bear to stay with him; and she
             assured me, that he was himself, <said rend="quotes">a very bad
             man</said>;</ecda:intSN> which, if true, was certainly enough to
             justify any lady, black or white, in making a little 
             incognito excursion for a week or so; therefore, as
             it appeared to be nothing more than a conjgal 
             quarrel, and as <persName ref="#marcia_0001">Marcia</persName> engaged never to run away
             any more (at the same time allowing that she had
             suffered her resentment to carry her too far, when
             it had carried her all the way to the <rs type="place">mountains</rs>), I
             desired that an act of oblivion might be passed in
             favour of <persName ref="#marcia_0001"><persName ref="cato_0095">Cato's</persName> daughter</persName>, and away she went,

          <p>The <rs type="place">negro houses</rs> are composed of wattles on the
             outside, with rafters of sweet-wood, and are well
             plastered within and whitewashed; they consist of
             two chambers, one for cooking and the other for
             sleeping, and are, in general, well furnished with
             chairs, tables, &amp;c., and I saw none without a four-
             post bedstead and plenty of bed-clothes; for, in spite 
             of the warmth of the climate, when the sun is not
             above the horizon the negro always feels very chill.
             I am assured that many of <rs type="persGroup">my slaves</rs> are very rich
             (and their property is inviolable), and that they are

             preferred to me: <ecda:anonPers>one</ecda:anonPers> wanted an additional supply
             of <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">lime</ecda:commodity> for the whitewashing <rs type="place">his house</rs>; <ecda:anonPers>another</ecda:anonPers> was
             building <rs type="place">a new house</rs> for a <ecda:anonPers>superannuated wife</ecda:anonPers> (for
             they have all so much decency as to call their 
             sexual attachments by a conjugal name), and
             wanted a little assistance towards the finishing it;
             <ecda:anonPers>a third </ecda:anonPers> requested <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">a new axe</ecda:commodity> to work with; and
             several entreated me to negotiate the purchase of
             <rs type="persGroup">some relation or friend</rs> belonging to another estate, 
             and with whom they were anxious to be reunited:
             but all their requests were for additional indulgences;
             not one complained of ill-treatment,
             hunger, or over-work.

          one. Not a drop of rain has fallen since the <date when="1615-11-16">16th
          of November</date>; the young canes are burning; and
          the drying quality of these norths is still more
          detrimental than the want of rain, so that these
          winds may be said to blow my pockets inside out;
          and as every draught of air, which I inhale with
          so much pleasure, is estimated to cost me a <measure ana="#currency">guinea</measure>, 
          I feel, while breathing it, like <persName ref="#frances_burney_1752">Miss Burney's</persName> <persName>Citizen</persName>

       <p>A <ecda:fauna><distinct type="scientific">Galli-wasp</distinct></ecda:fauna>, which was killed in the neighbouring
          morass, has just been brought to me.
          This is the <ecda:fauna>Alligator</ecda:fauna> in miniature, and is even more
          dreaded by the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> than its great relation: it
          is only to be found in swamps and morasses: that
          which was brought to me was about <measure>eighteen
          inches</measure> in length, and I understand that it is sel-
    <pb n="122"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">114</fw>     
          dom longer, although, as it grows in years, its
          thickness and the size of its jaws and head become
          greatly increased. It runs away on being encountered,
          and conceals itself; and it is only dangerous
          if trampled upon by accident, or if attacked; but
          then its bite is a dreadful one, not only from its
          tongue being armed with a sting (the venom of 
          which is very powerful, although not mortal), but
          from its teeth being so brittle that they generally
          break in the wound, and as it is hardly possible to
          extract the pieces entirely, the wound corrupts,
          and becomes an incurable sore of the most offensive
          nature. Luckily, these reptiles are very scarce,
          but nothing can exceed the terror and aversion in
          which they are held by the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>. This dead one
          had been lying in the room for several hours, yet, 
          on my servant's accidentally stirring the board on
          which the <ecda:fauna>galli-wasp</ecda:fauna> was stretched for my inspection,
          my little negro servant <persName ref="#george_0001">George</persName> darted out of
          the room in terror, and was at the bottom of the
          staircase in a moment. The skin of this animal
          appeared to be like shagreen in looks and strength,
          and was almost entirely composed of layers of very
          small scales; the colours were brownish-yellow
          and olive-green, the teeth numerous and piercing,
          and the claws of the feet very long and sharp:
          altogether it is a very hideous and disgusting creature.
          As to the <ecda:fauna>alligator</ecda:fauna> of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, it is a timid animal,
          which never was known to attack the human
          species, though it frequently takes the liberty of
      <pb n="123"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">115</fw>   
          running away with a <ecda:fauna>dog</ecda:fauna> or two, which appears to 
          be their <ecda:food ana="#fauna">venison</ecda:food> and <ecda:food ana="#fauna">turtle</ecda:food>. There is no river on
          my estate large enough for their inhabiting; but, 
          in <placeName>Paradise River</placeName>, which is not above <measure>four miles</measure>
          off, I understand that they are common.

      <p>A <ecda:anonPers>young mulatto carpenter</ecda:anonPers>, belonging to <persName ref="#horace_beckford_0001">Horace
         Beckford's</persName> estate of <placeName>Shrewsbury</placeName>, came to beg my
         intercession with his <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers>. He had been absent
         two days without leave, and on these occasions
         it is customary for the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs> to apply to <rs type="persGroup">some
         neighbouring gentleman</rs> for a note in their behalf,
         which, as I am told, never fails to obtain the pardon
         required, as the <rs type="persGroup">managers of estates</rs> are in 
         general but too happy to find an excuse for passing
         over wtithout punishment any offences which are
         not very heinous; indeed, what with the excellent
         laws already enacted for the protection of the
         slaves, and which every year are still futher 
         ameliorated, and what with the difficulty of procuring
         more <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>—(which can now only be done
         by purchasing them from other estates),—which
         makes it absolutely necessary for the <rs type="persGroup">managers</rs> to
         preserve the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs>, if they mean to preserve their 
         own situations,—I am fully persuaded that instances 
         of tyranny to <rs type="persGroup">negores</rs> are now very rare,
         at least in this island. But I must still acknowledge,
         from my own sad experience since my 
         arrival, that unless <rs type="person">a <rs type="properAdjective">West-Indian</rs> proprietor</rs> occa-
    <pb n="124"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">116</fw>  
         sionally visits his estates himself, it is utterly impossible
         for him to be <emph rend="italic">certain</emph> that his deputed authority
         is not abused, however good may be his intentions,
         and however vigilant his anxiety.
         </p>
      <p><rs type="person" ref="#matthew_lewis_1750">My father</rs> was one of the most humane and
         generous persons that ever existed; there was no
         indulgence which he ever denied his <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, and
         his letters were filled with the most absolute injunctions
         for their good treatment. When his
         estates became mine, the one upon which I am
         now residing was managed by an <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers>, considerably
         advanced in years, who had been long
         in our employment, and who bore the highest
         character for probity and humility. He was
         both attorney and overseer; and it was a particular
         recommendation to me that he lived in <rs type="place">my own 
         house</rs>, and therefore had <rs type="persGroup">my slaves</rs> so immediately
         under his eye, that it was impossible for
         any subaltern to misuse them without his knowledge.
         His letters to me expressed the greatest
         anxiety and attention respecting the welfare and
         comfort of the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs>;—so much so, indeed, that
         when I detailed his mode of management to
         <persName ref="#henry_vassall_fox_1773">Lord Holland</persName>, he observed, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that if he did all
         that was mentioned in his letters, he did as
         much as could possibly be expected or wished
         from an attorney</said>; and on parting with his own, 
         <persName ref="#henry_vassall_fox_1773">Lord Holland</persName> was induced to take mine to manage
         <rs type="place">his estates</rs>, which are in the immediate neighbourhood 
         of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>. <ecda:anonPers>This man</ecda:anonPers> died about two
      <pb n="125"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">117</fw>   
         years ago, and since my arrival, I happened to
         hear, that during his management a remarkably
         fine young penn-keeper, named <persName ref="#richard_0001">Richard</persName> (the
         brother of my intelligent carpenter, <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName>),
         had run away several times to the mountains. I
         had taken occasion to let the brothers know, between
         jest and earnest, that I was aware of <persName ref="#richard_0001">Richard's</persName>
         misconduct; and at length, one morning, <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John</persName>,
         while he blamed his brother's running away, let
         fall, that he had some excuse in the extreme ill-
         usage which he had received from one of the book-
         keepers, who <said rend="qutes" direct="false">had had a spite against him.</said> The
         hint alarmed me; I followed it, and nothing could
         equal my anger and surprise at learning the whole
         truth. 
       </p>
       <p>It seems, that while I fancied <ecda:anonPers>my attorney</ecda:anonPers> to
          be resident on <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, he was, in fact, generally
          attending to a property of his own, or looking
          after estates of which also he had the management
          in distant parts of the island. During his absence,
          an <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers> of his own appointing, without my
          knowledge, was left in absolute possession of his
          power, which he abused to such a degree, that
          almost every slave of respectibility on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>
          was compelled to become a runaway. The <rs type="place">property</rs>
          was nearly ruined, and absolutely in a state 
          of rebellion; and at length he committed an act of
          such severity, that the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, one and all, fled to
          <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName>, and threw themselves upon the
          protection of the <rs type="persGroup">magistrates</rs>, who immediately 
      <pb n="126"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">118</fw> 
         came over to <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, investigated the complaint,
         and <emph rend="italic">now</emph>, at length, the <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers>, who had known
         frequent instances of the <ecda:anonPers>overseer's</ecda:anonPers> tyranny, had 
         frequently rebuffed him for them, and had redressed
         the sufferers, but who still had dared to abuse my
         confidence so grossly as to continue him in his
         situation, upon this public exposure thought proper
         to dismiss him. Yet, while all this was going 
         on—while my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> were groaning under the iron
         rod of this <ecda:anonPers>petty tyrant</ecda:anonPers>—and while the public magistrature 
         was obliged to interfere to protect them
         from his cruelty—my <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers> had the insolence and 
         falsehood to write me letters, filled with assurances 
         of his perpetual vigialnce for their welfare—of their
         perfect good treatment and satisfaction; nor, if I
         had not come myself to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, in all probability
         should I ever have had the most distant idea how
         abominably the <rs type="persGroup">poor creatures</rs> had been misused.
       </p>
       <p>I have made it my business to mix as much as
          possible among the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, and have given them
          every encouragement to repose confidence in me;
          and I have uniformly found all those, upon whom
          any reliance can be placed, unite in praising the
          humanity of their <ecda:anonPers>present superintendent</ecda:anonPers>. Instantly
          on his arrival, he took the whole power of
          punishment into his own hands: he forbade the 
          slighest interference in this respect of any person
          whatever on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, white or black; nor have I
          been able to find as yet any one negro who has
          any charge of harsh treatment to bring against him. 
          
        <pb n="127"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">119</fw> 
          However, having already been so grossly deceived,
          I will never again place implicit confidence in any
          person whatever in a matter of such importance.
          Before my departure, I shall take every possible
          measure that may prevent any misconduct taking
          place without my being apprised of it as soon as
          possible; and I have already exhorted my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
          to apply to the <rs type="persGroup">magistrates</rs> on the very first instance
          of ill-usage, should any occur during my 
          absence.          
       </p>
       <p>I am indeed assured by every one about me,
          that to manage a <rs type="properAdjective">West-Indian</rs> estate without the
          occasional use of the <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>, however rarely,
          is impossible; and they insist upon it, that it is
          absurd in me to call <rs type="persGroup">my slaves</rs> ill-treated, because
          when they act grossly wrong, they are treated like 
          <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> soldiers and sailors. All this may be very
          true; but there is something to me so shocking in
          the idea of this execrable <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>, that I have
          positively forbidden the use of it on <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>;
          and if the <rs type="place">estate</rs> must go to rack and ruin without
          its use, to rack and ruin the <rs type="place">estate</rs> must go. Probably,
          I should care less about this punishment, if 
          I had not been living among those on whom it
          may be inflicted; but now, when I am accustomed
          to see every face that looks upon me, grinning
          from ear to ear with pleasure at my notice, and
          hear every voice cry <said rend="qutoes">God bless you, <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>,</said> as I
          pass, one must be an absolute brute not to feel unwilling
          to leave them subject to the lash; besids;

          and nature to suppose that my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> do not feel

      <p>The <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> has been crowded, since my arrival,
         with <rs type="persGroup">patients</rs> who have nothing the matter with 
         them. On Wednesday there were about <rs type="persGroup">thirty
         invalids</rs>, of whom only four were cases at all
         serious; the rest had <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">a lilly pain here, Massa</distinct>,</said> and
         <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">a bad pain me know nowhere, Massa</distinct>,</said> and
         evidently only came to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> in order to sit
         idle, and chat away the time with their friends.
         Four of them the <ecda:anonPers>doctor </ecda:anonPers> ordered into the field 
         peremptorily; the next day there came into <rs type="place">the
         sick-house</rs> six others; upon this I resolved to try
         my own hand at curing them; and I directed <ecda:anonPers>the
         head-driver</ecda:anonPers> to announce, that the presents which
         I had brought from <placeName>England</placeName> should be distributed
         to-day, that the <rs type="persGroup">new-born children</rs> should be
         christened, and that the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> might take possession
         of <rs type="place">my house</rs>, and amuse themselves till
         twelve at night. The effect of my prescription was
         magical; two thirds of the sick were hale
         and hearty, at work in the field on Saturday morning,
         and to-day not a soul remained in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>
         except the four serious cases.
      </p>
      <p>The christening took place about four o'clock.
         <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Sully's</persName> <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers>, which had been destined to perform a
         part on this occasion, had died in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>; but
         this morning the father came to complain of his
         disappointment, and to beg leave to substitute a
         child by <emph rend="italic">another</emph> <ecda:anonPers>wife</ecda:anonPers>, which had been born about two
         months before my arrival; and as the father is a very
      <pb n="131"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">123</fw>    
         serviceable fellow, and the <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers>, besides having
         brought up <rs type="persGroup">three children</rs> of her own, had the
         additional merit of having reared <ecda:anonPers>an infant</ecda:anonPers> whose
         own mother had died in child-bed, I broke through
         the rule of only christening those myself who
         should be born since my coming to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, and
         granted his request. By good luck, the first child
         to be named was the offspring of <persName ref="#minerva_0001">Minerva</persName> and
         <persName ref="#captain_0001">Captain</persName>; so I told the parents that as it would be
         highly proper to call the boy after the greatest 
         Captain that the world could produce, he should 
         be named <persName ref="wellington_1816">Wellington</persName>; and that I hoped that he
         would grow up to serve <emph rend="italic">me</emph> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> as well
         as the <persName ref="#arthur_wellesley_1769">Duke of Wellington</persName> had served his <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>,
         the <persName ref="george_III_england_1738">King of <placeName>England</placeName></persName>, in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. The <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Duke of
         Sully's</persName> child I wanted to call <name>Navarre</name>; but the
         father had brought over a free negro from <placeName>Savannah
        la Mar</placeName> to stand godfather, who was his <quote rend="italic" xml:lang="la" source="virgil_aeneid">fidus
         Achates</quote>, by the name of <persName ref="john_davies_0001">John Davies</persName>, and I found
         that he had set his heart upon calling the boy <persName ref="john_lewis_1815">John 
         Lewis,</persName>, after his friend and myself; so <persName ref="john_lewis_1815">John Lewis</persName>
         he was. 
      </p>
      <p>There ought to have been <ecda:anonPers>a third child</ecda:anonPers>, born
         at seven months, whom the <ecda:anonPers><distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">graundee</distinct></ecda:anonPers> had reared
         with great difficulty, and dismissed, quite strong,
         from the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>; the <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers> had taken great
         care of it till the tenth day, when she was entitled
         to an <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">allowance of clothes, provisions &amp;c.</ecda:commodity>;
         but no sooner had she received her reward, than on 
         that very night she suffered the <ecda:anonPers>child </ecda:anonPers>to remain so
      <pb n="132"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">124</fw>     
         long without food, while she went herself to dance
         on a neighbouring estate, that it was brought, in
         an exhausted state, back to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>; and, in
         spite of every care, it expired withing four and 
         twenty hours after its return. 
      </p>
      <p>The ceremony was performed with perfect gravity
         and propriety by all parties; I thought it was
         well to cut the reading part of it very short; but
         I read a couple of prayers, marked the foreheads 
         of the <rs type="persGroup">children</rs> with the sign of the cross, and instead
         of the concluding prayer, I substituted a wish,
         <quote rend="quotes">that God would bless the children, and make
         them live to be as good servants to me, as I prayed
         him to make me a kind <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct> to them</quote>; upon
         which all present very gravely made me their 
         lowest bows and courtesies, and then gave me a 
         loud huzza; so unusal a mode of approbation at a
         christening that it had nearly overturned my seriousness;
         and I made haste to serve out <ecda:food>Madeira</ecda:food>
         to the <rs type="persGroup">parents and assistants</rs>, that they might drink
         the healths of the new <name>Christians</name> and of each other.
         The <rs type="persGroup">mothers</rs> and the <ecda:anonPers><distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">graundee</distinct></ecda:anonPers> were then called up
         to the table, and the <rs type="persGroup">ladies in a family way</rs> were
         arranged behind them.                 
      </p>
      <p><emph rend="italic">Their</emph> title in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is rather coarse, but very
         expressive. I asked <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName> one day <said rend="quotes" direct="false">who was
         <ecda:anonPers>that woman</ecda:anonPers> with a basket on her head?</said> <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Massa</distinct>,</said>
         he answered, <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">that one belly-woman going to sell
         provisions at the <placeName>Bay</placeName></distinct>.</said> As she was going to sell
         <emph rend="italic"><ecda:commodity ana="#sale">provisions</ecda:commodity></emph>, I supposed that <distinct type="dialect"><emph rend="italic">belly</emph>-woman</distinct> was the
      <pb n="133"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">125</fw> 
         name of her trade; but it afterwards appeared
         that she was one of those females who had given
         in their names as being then labouring under
         <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_errors">The pleasing punishment which women bear</quote>;
         and who, in consequence, were discharged from
         all severe labour. I then gave the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">graundee</distinct> and
         the <rs type="persGroup">mothers</rs> <measure ana="#currency">a dollar</measure> each, and told them, that for
         the future they might claim the same sum, in
         addition to their usual allowance of clothes and provisions,
         for every infant which should be brought 
         to the overseer alive and well on the fourteenth
         day; and I also gave each mother a present of <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #textile">a
         scarlet girdle with a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">silver medal</ecda:commodity> in the centre</ecda:commodity>,
         telling her always to wear it on feasts and holidays,
         when it should entitle her to marks of peculiar
         respect and attention, such as being one of the 
         first served, and receiving a larger portion than
         the rest; that the <emph rend="italic">first</emph> fault which she might
         commit, should be forgiven on the production of 
         this <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #textile">girdle</ecda:commodity>; and that when she should have any
         favour to ask, she should always put it round her
         waist, and be assured, that on seeing it, the over-
         seer would allow the wearer to be entitled to
         particular indulgence. On every additional child
         an additional <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #currency">medal</ecda:commodity> is to be affixed to the <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #use">belt</ecda:commodity>,
         and precedence is to follow the greater number of 
         medals. I expected that this notion of an order
         of honour would have been treated as completely 
         fanciful and romantic; but to my great surprise, 
      <pb n="134"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">126</fw> 
         <ecda:anonPers>my manager</ecda:anonPers> told me, that <said rend="quotes" direct="false">he never knew <measure ana="#currency">a dollar</measure>
         better bestowed than the one which formed 
         the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency #circulation">medal</ecda:commodity> of the <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">girdle</ecda:commodity>, and that he thought the
         institution likely to have a very good effect.</said>       
      </p>
      <p>Immediately after the christening the <name>Eboe</name>
         drums were produced, and in defiance of Sunday
         the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> had the irreverence to be gay and happy,
         while the presents were getting in order for distribution.
         All the <rs type="persGroup">men</rs> got <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">jackets</ecda:commodity>, the <rs type="persGroup">women</rs> <measure>seven
         yards</measure> of <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">stuff</ecda:commodity> each for <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #use">>petticoats, &amp;c.,</ecda:commodity>  and the
         children as much <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">printed cotton</ecda:commodity> as would make
         <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #use">a couple of frocks</ecda:commodity>. The <name>Creoles</name> were delighted
         beyond measure when <rs type="persGroup">some of the <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> male
         negroes</rs> exclaimed, <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Tank, massa</distinct>,</said> and made a
         low courtesy in the confusion of their gratitude.
         As they were all called to receive their presents
         alphabetically in pairs, some of the combinations 
         were very amusing. We had. <persName ref="#punch_0001">Punch</persName> and <persName ref="#plato_0002">Plato</persName>,
         <persName ref="#priam_0001">Priam</persName> and <persName ref="#pam_0001">Pam</persName>, <persName ref="#hemp_0001">Hemp</persName> and <persName ref="#hercules_0002">Hercules</persName>, and <persName ref="#minerva_0001">Minerva</persName>
         and <persName ref="#moll_0001">Moll</persName> come together. By twelve they dispersed, 
         and I went to bed, as usual on these occasions,
         with a violent headach.

        <p>While I was at dinner, a violent uproar was
           heard below stairs. On enquiry, it proved to be
           <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName>, quarreling with his niece <persName ref="#phillis_0001">Phillis</persName> (a good-
           looking black girl employed about the house),
           about a broken pitcher; and as her explanation
           did not appear satisfactory to him, he had thought 
        <pb n="135"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">127</fw>   
          proper to give her a few boxes on the hear. Upon
          hearing this, I read him such a lecture upon the
          baseness of a man's striking a woman, and told 
          him with so much severity that his heart must be
          a bad one to commit such an offence, that poor
          <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName>, having never heard a harsh word from me
           before, scarcely knew whether he stood upon his
           head or his heels. When he afterwards brought
           my <ecda:food ana="#flora">coffee</ecda:food>, he expressed his sorrow for having
           offended me, and begged my pardon in the most
           humble manner. I told him, that to obtain mine, 
           he must first obtain that of <persName ref="#phillis_0001">Phillis</persName>, and he immediately
           declared himself ready to make her any
           apology that I might dictate. So the girl was 
           called in; and her uncle going up to her, <said rend="quotes">I am
           very sorry, <persName ref="#phillis_0001">Phillis</persName>,</said> said he, <said rend="quotes">that I gave way to
           high passion, and called you hard names, and
           struck you: which I ought not to have done while
           <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct> was in the house;</said> (here I was going to
           interrupt him, but he was too clever not to perceive
           his blunder, and made haste to add) <said rend="quotes">nor if
           he had <emph rend="italic">not</emph> been here, nor at all; so I hope you
           will have the kindness to forgive me this once, and
           I never will strike you again, and so I beg your pardon.</said>
           And he then put out his hand to her in the
           most frank and hearty manner imaginable; and on
           her accepting it, made her three or four of his very
           lowest and most graceful bows. I furnished him
           with <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">a piece of money</ecda:commodity> to give her as a peace-offering;
           they left the room thoroughly reconciled, and 
         <pb n="136"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">128</fw> 
           in five minutes after they and the rest of the servants
           were all chattering, laughing, and singing
           together, in the most perfect harmony and good-
           humour. I suppose, if I had desired an upper
           servant in <placeName>England</placeName> to make the same submission,
           he would have preferred quitting my service to
           doing what he would have called <said rend="quotes" direct="false">humbling him-
           self to an inferior;</said> or, if he had found himself
           compelled to give way, he would have been sulky 
           with the girl, and found fault with every thing that
           she did in the house for a twelvemonth after.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are some choice ungrateful
           scoundrels among the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>: on the night
           of their first dance, a couple of <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">sheep</ecda:fauna> disappeared
           from the pen, although they could not have been
           taken from want of food, as on that very morning
           there had been an ample distribution of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">fresh beef</ecda:food>;
           and last night another <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">sheep</ecda:fauna> and a quantity of
           <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">poultry</ecda:fauna> followed them. Yesterday, too, a young
           rascal of a boy called <persName ref="#massa_jackey_0001" rend="quotes">massa Jackey</persName>, who is in
           the frequent habit of running away for months at
           a time, and whom I had distinguished from the
           cleverness of his countenancy and buffonery of his
           manners, came to beg my permission to go and
           purchase food with some <seg ana="#currency">money</seg> which I had just
           given him, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">because he was almost starving; his
           parents were dead, he had no provision-grounds, no 
           allowance, and nobody ever gave him anything.</said>
           Upon this I sent <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName> with the boy to the <ecda:anonPers>store-
           keeper</ecda:anonPers>, when it appeared that he had always re-
  <pb n="137"/>
  <fw type="pageNum">129</fw>  
           ceived a regular allowance of <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #sale #food">provisions</ecda:commodity> twice a
           week, which he generally sold, as well as his
           <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #sale">clothes</ecda:commodity>, at the <placeName>Bay</placeName>, for <ecda:food>spirits</ecda:food>; had received an
           additional portion only last Friday; and, into the
           bargain, during the whole of that week had been
           fed from the house. What he could propose to 
           himself by telling a lie which must be so soon detected,
           I cannot conceive; but I am assured, that
           unless a negro has an interest in telling the truth,
           he always lies—in order to keep his tongue in
           practice.            
        </p>
        <p>One species of flattery (or of <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic"><rs type="properAdjective">Congo</rs>-saw</distinct>, as we
           call it here) amused me very much this morning: an
           <rs type="person" ref="#philippa_0001">old woman</rs> who is in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> wanted to express 
           her gratitude for some <ecda:food ana="#fauna">stewed fish</ecda:food> which I
           had sent her for supper, and, instead of calling me
           <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes">massa</distinct>, she always said—<said rend="quote"><distinct type="dialect">Tank him, <emph>my husband</emph></distinct></said>

       <p>This was a day of perpetual occupation. I rose
          at six o'clock, and went down to the <placeName>Bay</placeName> to settle
          some business; on my return I visited the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>

          me to inform their <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers> how ill they had been

          the field while they were still too weak to work, they

          beyond the limits of the law);</ecda:intSN> and my head driver,
          who was less scrupulously delicate than myself as
          to ocular inspection of <persName ref="#juliet_0002">Juliet's</persName> person (which
          <persName ref="#juliet_0002">Juliet</persName>, to do her justice, was perfectly ready to

          the <ecda:anonPers>overseer's</ecda:anonPers> conduct had been such, that nothing
          should have prevented her running away long ago
          if she could but have had the heart to abandon a
          child which she had on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>.</ecda:intSN> Both were
          poor feeble-looking creatures, and seemed very
          unfit subjects for any severe correction. I promised 
          to write to their <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>; and, as they were afraid 
          of being punished on their return home for having
          thrown themselves on my protetion, I wrote a
          note to the <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers>, requesting that the women
          might remain quite unmolested till the <ecda:anonPers>trustee's</ecda:anonPers>
          arrival, which was daily expected; and, with this

          <persName ref="#delia_0001">Delia</persName> and <persName ref="#juliet_0002">Juliet</persName> departed, apparently much comforted.

      <p>They were succeeded by no less a personage

         soul, who had purchased her freedom from my

         black wench, who, being <persName ref="#venus_0002">Venus's</persName> <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="la">locum tenens</foreign>, was,

         the then <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers>, <persName ref="#venus_0002">Venus</persName> had never received any
         title, and she naw came to beg <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">massa so good as

         compelled her to work, although, at the same
         time, her substitute was on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>. Of course, 
         I promised the paper required, and engaged to act
         the part of a second <persName ref="#vulcan_0001">Vulcan</persName> by releasing <persName ref="#venus_0002">Venus</persName>
         from my chains: but the paper was not the only

         She told me, that when the presents were

         would otherwise have had, was, of course <said rend="quotes">given

         she had always worked for him well,</said> and <said direct="false" rend="quotes">she

      <p><persName ref="#venus_0002">Venus</persName> had scarcely evacuated the premises,

    <fw type="pageNum">132</fw>  
       <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName>, with proposals for instructing
         the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> in religion; and the <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister</rs>, in his
         turn, was replaced by one of the Sunday-night
         thieves, who had been caught while in the actual
         possession of one of my <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">sheep</ecda:fauna> and a <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">great turkey-
         cock</ecda:fauna>; and, to make matters worse, the depredator's
         name was <persName ref="#hercules_0002">Hercules</persName>! <persName ref="#hercules_0001">Hercules</persName>, whom
         <persName ref="#virgil_0070">Virgil</persName> states to have exercised so much severity
         on <persName ref="cacus_0001">Cacus</persName>, when his own <ecda:fauna>oxen</ecda:fauna> were stolen, was
         taken up himself for stealing my <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">sheep</ecda:fauna> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>!
         The demi-god had nothing to say in his excuse:
         he had just received a large allowance of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">beef</ecda:food>:—
         therefore, hunger had no share in his transgression;
         and the committing the offence during the very time
         that I was giving the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> a festival, rendered
         his ingratitude the more flagrant.
      </p>
      <p>I perfectly well understood that the man was sent
         to me by my <ecda:anonPers>agent</ecda:anonPers>, in order to show the absolute
         necessitiy of sometimes employing the <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>, and
         to see whether I would suffer the fellow to escape
         unpunished. But, as this was the first offender who
         had been brought before me, I took that for a
         pretext to absolve him: so I lectured him for half
         an hour with great severity, swore that on the very
         next offence I would order him to be sold; and that if
         he would not do his fair proportion of work without
         being lashed, he should be sent to work somewhere
         else; for I would suffer no such worthless fellows
         on my estate, and would not be at the expense of
         a <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg> to correct him. He promised most

        earnestly to behave better in future, and <persName ref="#hercules_0002">Hercules</persName> 
        was suffered to depart: but I am told that no good
        can be expected of him; and that he had been absent for
        five weeks together before my arrival, and only returned
        home upon hearing that there was a distribution 
        of <ecda:food ana="#fauna #commodity #circulation">beef</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#commodity #circulation">rum</ecda:food>, and <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">jackets</ecda:commodity> going forward; in
        return for all which, he stole my <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">sheep</ecda:fauna> and my
        poor <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #circulation">great turkey-cock</ecda:fauna>.            
      </p>
      <p>But now came the most puzzling business of the
        day. About four years ago, two <name>Eboes</name>, called
        <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName> and <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>, were rivals, after being intimate
        friends: <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName> (who is an excellent faithful negro,
        but not very wise) was the successful candidate;
        and, of course, the friendship was interrupted,
        till <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> married the sister of the disputed
        fair one. From this time the brothers-in-law lived 
        in perfect harmony together; but during the first
        festival given on my arrival, <rs type="place"><persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle's</persName> house</rs> was
        broken open, and robbed of all his clothes, &amp;c. 
        The <ecda:anonPers>thief</ecda:anonPers> was sought for, but in vain. On Monday
         last I found <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName> in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, complaining
        of a pain in his side; and the blood, which had
        been taken from him, gave reason to apprehend 
        a pleurisy arising from cold; but, as the disorder
        had been taken in its earliest stage, nothing
        dangerous was expected. The fever abated; the
        medicines performed their offices properly; still
        the man's spirits and strength appeared to decline,
        and he persisted in saying he was not better, 
       <pb n="142"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">134</fw>  
        and should never do well. At length, to-day, he
        got out of his sick bed, came to the house, attended
        by <rs type="persGroup">the whole body of drivers</rs>, and accused his
        brother-in-law of having been the stealer of his 
        goods. I asked, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">Had <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> been seen near
        <rs type="place">his house</rs>? Had any of his effects been seen in <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward's</persName>? Did <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> refuse to suffer

        present, pressed for the most strict scrutiny, and
        asserted his perfect ignorance; nor could the accuser 
        advance any grounds for the charge, except
        his belief of <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward's</persName> guilt. <said direct="false" rend="quotes">Why did he think

        he gave the name of a Christian, one of which was
        <name>Daniel</name>; and <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> had said, that this would

        had immediately felt this pain in his side, and

        to find his goods, <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> had used it to kill him-

      </p>
      <p><seg ana="#obeah">This last argument quite got the better of my

         to convince the fellow of his folly and injustice,

         It was, therefore, improbable in the highest degree,

      <p> I sent for <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>, had him alone with me for
         above two hours, and pressed him most earnestly
         to confide in me. I gave him <measure ana="#currency">a dollar</measure> to convince
         him of my good-will towards him; assured him
         that whatever he might tell me should remain a
         secret between us; said, that <seg ana="#poison">I was certain of his
         not having used any poison</seg>, or done any thing
         really mischievous; but as I suspected him of
         having played some monkey-tricks or other, which,
         however harmless in themselves, had evidently
         operated dangerously upon <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle's</persName> imagination, I
         begged him to tell me precisely what had passed,
         in order that I might counteract its baleful effects.
         In reply, <seg ana="#obeah"><persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> swore to me most solemnly, <said rend="quotes">by
         the great God Almighty, who lives above the
         clouds,</said> that he never had used any such practices;
         that he had never gone into the <rs type="place">woods</rs> to
         gather <ecda:flora ana="#obeah">whangra</ecda:flora>; and that he had considered
         <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName>, from the moment of his own marriage, as his 
         brother, and had always, till then, loved him as such.
         His eyes filled with tears while he protested that
         he should be as sorry for <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle's</persName> death as if it were
         himself; and he complained bitterly of having the
         ill name of an <rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs> man given to him, which
         made him feared and shunned by his companions,
         and entirely without cause. But he said that he 
       <pb n="145"/>
       <fw type="pageNum">137</fw>   
         was certain that <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName> would never have suspected
         him of such a crime, if a third person had not put
         it into his head. There is a negro on my estate
         called <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>, who has been long and strongly suspected
         of having connections with <rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs> men.
         When <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> was quite young, he was under this 
         fellow's superintendence, and he now assured me,
         that <persName ref="#adam_0001">Adam</persName> had not only endeavoured to draw him
         into similar practices, but had even pressed him
         very earnestly to lay a <ecda:food>magical egg</ecda:food> under the door
         of <ecda:anonPers>a book-keeper</ecda:anonPers> whose conduct had been obnoxious. 
         <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> had positively refused: from
         that moment his superintendent, from being his
         protector, had become his enemy, had shown him
         spite upon every occasion; and he it was, he had
         no doubt, who, for the purpose of injuring him,
         had put this foolish notion into <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle's</persName> head.</seg>
        </p>
      <p>Upon enquiry it appeared, that on the very morning succeeding
         <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle's</persName> entering the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, this
         suspected man had gone there also, on pretence of 
         sickness, and had remained there to watch the invalid;
         although it was so evident that nothing was
         the matter with him, that the <ecda:anonPers>doctor</ecda:anonPers> had frequently
         ordered him to the field, but the man had always
         found means for evading the order. The first
         thing that we now did was to turn him out of <rs type="place">the
         sick-house</rs>, neck and heels; I then took <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>
         with me to <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle's</persName> bedside, where the former told
         his brother-in-law, that if he had ever done any
         thing to offend him, he heartily begged his pardon;
    <pb n="146"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">138</fw>   
        that he swore by the <name>Almighty God</name> that he had
        never <seg ana="#obeah">been in the bush</seg> to hurt him, nor any where
        else; on the contrary, that he had always loved
        him, and wished him well; and that he now begged
        him to be friends with him again, to forget and forgive
        all former quarrels, and to accept the hand
        which he offered him in all sincerity. The sick
        man also confessed, that he had always loved <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>
        as his brother, had <said rend="quotes" direct="false">eaten and drunk with
        him for many years with perfect good-will,</said> and that
         it was his ingratitude for such affection which vexed
         him more than any thing. On this I told him, that
         I insisted upon their being good friends for the
         future, and that I should never hear the word
         <distinct type="mentioned" ana="#obeah">Obeah</distinct>, or any such nonsense, mentioned on my
         estate, on pain of my extreme displeasure. I promised
         that, as soon as <persName ref="#piclke_0001">Pickle</persName> should be quite recovered,
         I would buy for him exactly a set of such 
         things as had been stolen from him; that <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> 
         should bring them to his house, to show that he
         had rather give him things than take them away;
         and I then desired to see them shake hands. They
         did so, with much apparent cordiality; <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>
         then went back to his work; and this evening,
         when I sent him a <ecda:food>dish</ecda:food> from my table, <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName> desired
         the <ecda:anonPers>servant</ecda:anonPers> to tell me, that he had hardly any
         fever, and felt <said rend="quotes"><distinct rend="italic">quite so so</distinct>,</said> which, in the negro
         dialect, means <quote rend="quotes">a great deal better</quote>. I begin,
         therefore, to hope that we shall save the foolish fellow's

      <p>Every morning <ecda:anonPers>my agent</ecda:anonPers> regales me with some
         fresn instance of insubordination: he says nothing
         plainly, but shakes his head, and evidently gives
         me to understand, that the <rs type="place">estate</rs> cannot be
         governed properly without the <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>. It
         seems that this morning, the <rs type="persGroup">women</rs>, one and all,
         refused to carry away the <distinct type="agricultural" rend="italic">trash</distinct> (which is one of
         the easiest tasks that can be set), and that without
         the slightest pretence: in consequence, the mill
         was obliged to be stopped; and when the <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers>
         on that station insisted on their doing their duty,
         a little fierce young devil of a <persName ref="#whaunica_0001">Miss Whaunica</persName> flew
         at his throat, and endeavoured to strangle him:
         the agent was obliged to be called in, and, at
         length, this petticoat rebellion was subdued, and
         every thing went on as usual. I have, in consequence,
         assured the women, that since they will 
         not be managed by fair treatment, I must have
         recourse to other measures; and that, if any similar
         instance of misconduct should take place, I
         was determined, on my return from <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, to
         sell the most refractory, ship myself immediately
  
     <pb n="148"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">140</fw>     
        for <placeName>England</placeName>, and never return to them and <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>
         more. This threat, at the time, seemed to produce
         a great effect; all hands were clasped, and all voices
         were raised, imploring me not to leave them, and
         assuring me, that in future they would do their
         work quietly and willingly. But whether the impression
         will last beyond the immediate moment is
         a point greatly to be doubted.

   <p>Another morning, with the mill stopped, no
      <ecda:commodity ana="#food #refining">liquor</ecda:commodity> in the <rs type="place">boiling house</rs>, and no work done.
      The <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers> brought the most obstinate and insolent
      of the women to be lectured by me; and I
      bounced and stormed for half an hour with all my
      might and main, especially at <persName ref="#whaunica_0001">Whaunica</persName>, whose
      ingratitude was peculiar; as she is the wife of
      <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>, the <name>Eboe</name>, whom I had been protecting
      against the charge of theft and <name ana="#obeah">Obeahism</name>, and had
      shown him more than usual kindness. They, at 
      last, appeared to be very penitent and ashamed of
      themselves, and engaged never to behave ill again,
      if I would but forgive them this present fault;
      <persName ref="#whaunica_0001">Whaunica</persName>, in particular, assuring me very earnestly,
      that I should never have cause to accuse her of
      <distinct rend="quotes" type="dialect">bad manners</distinct> again; for, in negro dialect, ingratitude 
      is always called <distinct rend="quotes" type="dialect">bad manners</distinct>. <ecda:anonPers>My
      agent</ecda:anonPers> declares, that they never conducted themselves
      so ill before; that they worked cheerfully
      and properly till my arrival; but now they think 
    <pb n="149"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">141</fw> 
      that I shall protect them against all punishment,
      and have made regularly <measure>ten hogsheads</measure> of <ecda:commodity ana="#food #refining">sugar</ecda:commodity> a
      week less than they did before my coming upon
      the estate. This is the more provoking, as, by
      delaying the conclusion of the crop, the latter part
      of it may be driven into the rainy season, and
      then the labour is infinitely more severe both for
      the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs> and the <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna>, and more detrimental to
      their health. 
   </p>   
   <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister</rs> of <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName> has shown
      me a plan for the religious instruction of the
      <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, which was sent to him by the <rs type="persGroup">ecclesiastical
      comissaries</rs> at <placeName>Kingston</placeName>. It consisted
      but of two points: against the frst (which recommended
      the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs> being <emph rend="italic">ordered</emph> to go to church
      on a Sunday) I positively declared myself. Sunday
      is now the absolute property of the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
      for their relaxation, as Saturday is for the cultivation
      of their grounds; and I will not suffer a 
      single hour of it to be taken from them for any
      purpose whatever. If <rs type="persGroup">my slaves</rs> choose to go to
      church on Sundays, so much the better; but not
      one of them shall be <emph rend="italic">ordered</emph> to do one earthly 
      thing on Sundays, but that which he chooses himself.
      The second article recommended occasional
      pastoral visits of the <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister</rs> to the different
      estates; and in this respoect I promised to give
      him every facility—although I greatly doubt any
      good effect being produced by a few short visits,
      at considerable intervals, on the minds of ignorant 
 <pb n="150"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">142</fw>  
      creatures, to whom no palpable and immediate
      benefit is offered. It appears, indeed, to me, that
      the only means of giving the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> morality and
      religion must be through the medium of education,
      and their being induced to read such books in 
      <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister's</rs> absence as may recall to their thoughts
      what they have heard from him; otherwise, he may
      talk for an hour, and they will have understood
      but little—and remember nothing. There is not a
      single negro among my whole three hundred who
      can read a line; and what I suppose to be wanted 
      on <rs type="properAdjective">West-Indian</rs> estates is not an importation of
      missionaries, but of schoolmasters on <persName ref="#andrew_bell_1753">Dr. Bell's</persName>
      plan, if it could by any means be introduced here
      with effect. However, in the mean while I told
      the <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister</rs>, what I was perfectly well inclined to
      have every measure tried that might enlighten the
      minds of the negroes, provided it did not interfere
      with their own hours of leisure, and were not
      compusory. I mentioned to him a plan for
      commencing his instructions under the most favourable
      auspices, of which he seemed to approve;
      and he has promised to make occasional visits on
      <rs type="place">my estate</rs> during my absence, which may do good
      and can do no harm; and, even should it fail to
      make the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> religious, will, at least add another
      humane inspector to my list. Soon after the 
      <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister's</rs> departure, <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName> came to repair
      one of the windows. Now <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John</persName> is in great disgrace 
      with me in one respect. Instead of having a 
<pb n="151"/>
<fw type="pageNum">143</fw>    
      wife on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, he keeps one at the <placeName>Bay</placeName>, so that
      his children will not belong to me. <persName ref="#phillis_0001">Phillis</persName>, too,
      who formerly lived with <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John</persName>, says, that she parted
      with him, because he threw away all his moneu upon 
      <rs type="persGroup">the <rs type="properAdjective">Bay</rs> girls</rs>; though <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John</persName> asserts that the cause
      of separation was his catching the false <persName ref="#phillis_0001">Phillis</persName>
      coming out of <ecda:anonPers>one of the book-keepers'</ecda:anonPers> bedrooms.
   </p>
   <p>However, it is certain, that now his connections
      are all at the <placeName>Bay</placeName>; and I have assured him, that
      if he does not provide himself with a wife at
      <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, before my return from <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, I will
      put him up to auction, and call the girls together
      to bid for him, one offering half a dozen <ecda:food ana="#flora">yams</ecda:food>,
      and another a bit of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt fish</ecda:food>; and the highest
      bidder shall carry him off as her property. But
      to-day, as he came into the room just as the minister
      left it, I told him that <persName ref="#pope_0001">Dr. Pope</persName> was coming
      to give the negroes some instruction; and that
      he had left part of a catechism for him, which he
      was to get by heart against his next visit. <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John</persName>
      promised to study it dilligently, and went off to
      get it read to him by <ecda:anonPers>one of the book-keepers</ecda:anonPers>.
      Several of his companions came to hear it from
      curiosity, and the <ecda:anonPers>book-keeper</ecda:anonPers> read aloud:—
      <said rend="quotes"><lg type="poem">
         <l><persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName> is gone to the <placeName>Bay</placeName>, boys,</l>
         <l>On <rs type="persGroup">the girls</rs> to spend his cash;</l>
         <l>And when <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName> comes home, boys,</l>
         <l><persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName> deserves the lash.</l>
      </lg>        
      </said>
      So <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John</persName> went away shaking his head, and saying,
      <said rend="quotes" direct="false"><distinct type="dialect">Massa</distinct> had told him, that the <rs type="person" ref="#pope_0001">minister</rs> had left
 <pb n="152"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">144</fw>      
      that paper to make him a better <name>Christian</name>. But
      he was certain that the <rs ref="#pope_0001" type="person">minister</rs> had nothing to do
      with that, and that <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct> had made it all himself
      about <rs type="persGroup">the <rs type="properAdjective">Bay</rs> girls</rs>.</said>

<p>I shall have enought to do in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> if I accept
   all the offices that are pressed upon me. <rs type="persGroup">A large
   body of negroes</rs>, from a neighbouring estate, came
   over to <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> this morning, to complain of
   hard treatment, in various ways, from <ecda:anonPers>their overseer</ecda:anonPers>
   and <rs type="persGroup">drivers</rs>, and requesting me to represent
   their injuries to <ecda:anonPers>their trustee</ecda:anonPers> here, and <ecda:anonPers>their proprietor</ecda:anonPers>
   in <placeName>England</placeName>. Their charges were so strong,
   that I am certain that they must be fictitious;
   however, I listened to their story with patience;
   promised that the <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers> (whom I was to see in a 
   few days) should know their complaint;—and they
   went away apparently satisfied. Then came <rs type="person" ref="aberdeen_0001">a
   runaway negro</rs>, who wanted to return home, and
   requested me to write a few lines to <ecda:anonPers>his master</ecda:anonPers>,
   to save him from the lash. He was succeeded by a
   poor creature named <persName ref="#bessie_0001">Bessie</persName>, who, although still a
   young woman, is dispenced with from labour, on
   account of her being afflicted with the <distinct type="scientific" rend="italic">cocoa-bay</distinct>,
   one of the most horrible of negro diseases. It
   shows itself in large blotches and swellings, and
   which generally, by degrees, moulder away the
   joints of the toes and fingers, till they rot and drop
   off; sometimes as much as half a foot will go at 
<pb n="153"/>
<fw type="pageNum">145</fw>   
  once. As the disease is communicable by contact,
  the person so afflicted is necessarily shunned by
  society; and this poor woman, who is married to
  <persName ref="#john_fuller_0001">John Fuller</persName>, one of the best young men on
   <rs type="place">estate</rs>, and by whom she has had <rs type="persGroup">four children</rs> (although
   they are all dead), has for some time been
   obliged to live separated from him, lest he should
   be destroyed by contracting the same complaint. 
   She now came to tell me, that she wanted a
   <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">blanket</ecda:commodity>, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">for that the cold killed her of nights;</said>
   cold being that which negroes dislike most, and
   from which most of their illnesses arise. Of course
   she got her <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #use">blanket</ecda:commodity>; then she said, that she wanted
   medicine for her complaint. <said direct="false" rend="quotes">Had not the doctor
   seen her?</said> <said rend="quotes" direct="false">Oh, yes! <persName ref="goodwin_0001">Dr. Goodwin</persName>; but the
   white doctor could do her no good. She wanted
   to go to a black doctor, named <persName ref="#ormond_0001">Ormond</persName>, who
   belonged to <ecda:anonPers>a neighbouring gentleman</ecda:anonPers>.</said> I told 
   her, that if this black doctor understood her particular
   disease better than others, certainly she
   should go to him; but that if he pretended to cure
   her by charms or spells, or any thing but medicine,
   I should desire <ecda:anonPers>his master</ecda:anonPers> to cure the black doctor
   by giving him the punishment proper for such an
   imposter. Upon this <seg ana="#obeah"><persName ref="#bessie_0001">Bessie</persName> burst into tears, and
   said <said direct="false" rend="quotes">that <persName ref="#ormond_0001">Ormond</persName> was not an <rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs> man, and
   that she had suffered too much by <rs type="persGroup"><rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs> men</rs> to
   wish to have any more to do with them. She had
   made <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> her enemy by betraying him, when <seg ana="#poison">he
   had attempted to poison the <ecda:anonPers>former attorney</ecda:anonPers></seg>; he
   <pb n="154"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">146</fw>
   had then cursed her, and wished that she might
   never be hearty again: and from that very time
   her complaint had declared itself; and her poor
   <distinct type="dialect">pickaninies</distinct> had all died away, one after another;
   and she was sure that it was <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> who had done
   all this mischief by <name>Obeah</name>.</said></seg> Upon this, I put myself
   in a great rage, and asked her, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">how she could
   believe that <name>God</name> would suffer a low wicked fellow
   like <persName ref="#adam_002">Adam</persName> to make good people die, merely because
   he wished them dead?</said> <said direct="false" rend="quotes">She did not
   know; she knew nothing about <name>God</name>; had never
   heard of any such Being, nor of any other world.</said>
   I told her, that <name>God</name> was a great personage, <said direct="false" rend="quotes">who
   lived up yonder above the blue, in a place full of
   pleasures and free from pains, where <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> and
   wicked people could not come; that her <distinct type="dialect">pickaninies</distinct>
   were not dead for ever, but were only gone 
   up to live with <name>God</name>, who was good, and would
   take care of them for her; and that if she were 
   good, when she died, she too would go up to <name>God</name>
   above the blue, and see all her four <distinct type="dialect">pickaninies</distinct>
   again.</said> The idea seemed so new and so agreeable
   to the poor creature, that she clapped her hands
   together, and began laughing for joy; so I said to
   her every thing that I could imagine likely to remove
   her prejudice; told her that <seg ana="#obeah">I should make 
   it a crime even so much as to mention the word
   <distinct type="mentioned">Obeah</distinct> on the estate; and that, if any negro from
   that time forward should be proved to have accused
   another of Obeahing him, or of telling another that
   <pb n="155"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">147</fw> 
   he had been Obeahed, he should forfeit his share
   of the next present of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt-fish</ecda:food>, which I meant soon
   to distribute among the <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs>, and should never
   receive any favour from me in future;</seg> so I gave
   <persName ref="#bessie_0001">Bessie</persName> a piece of <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>, and she seemed to go
   away in better spirits than she came.
  </p>   
 <p>This <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>, of whom she complained, is a most
    dangerous fellow, and the terror of all his companions,
    with whom he lives in a constant state of
    warfare. He is a <rs type="properAdjective">creole</rs>, born on my own property,
    and has <rs type="persGroup">several sisters</rs>, who have obtained
    their freedom, and are in every respect creditable
    and praiseworthy; and to <ecda:anonPers>one of whom</ecda:anonPers> I consider
    myself as particularly indebted, as she was
    the means of saving poor <persName ref="#richard_0001">Richard's</persName> life, when the
    tyranny of the <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers> had brought him almost
    to the brink of the grave. But this brother is in
    every thing the reverse of <rs type="persGroup">his sisters</rs>: <seg ana="#poison">there
    is no doubt of his having (as <persName ref="#bessie_0001">Bessie</persName> stated) infused
    poison into the water-jars through spite against <ecda:anonPers>the
    late superintendent</ecda:anonPers></seg>. It was this same fellow
    whom <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> suspected of having put into <rs ref="#pickle_0001" type="person">his

    <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs> man</ecda:anonPers> was found concealed, whom <ecda:anonPers>my attorney</ecda:anonPers>
    seized and transported last year.</seg> He is, unfortunately,
    clever and plausible; and I am told 
    that the mischief which he has already done, by
    working upon the folly and superstition of his
    fellows, is incalculable; yet I cannot get rid of 
    <pb n="156"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">148</fw> 
    him: the law will not suffer any negro to be
    shipped off the <rs type="place">island</rs>, until he shall have been
    convicted of felony at the sessions; I cannot sell
    him, for nobody would buy him, nor even accept
    him, if I would offer them so dangerous a present;
    if he were to go away, the law would seize him,
    and bring him back to me, and I should be obliged
    to pay heavily for his re-taking and his maintenance
    in the workhouse. In short, I know not what I 
    can do with him, except make a <name>Christian</name>
    of him! This might induce the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> to believe,
    that he had lost his infernal power by the superior
    virtue of the holy water; but, perhaps he may refuse
    to be christened. However, I will at least ask
    him the question; and if he consents, I will send
    him―and <measure ana="#currency">a couple of dollars</measure>—to the <rs type="person" ref="pope_0001">clergyman</rs>—
    for he shall not have so great a distinction as baptism
    from <distinct type="dialect">massa's</distinct> own hand—and see what effect
    <name ana="#obeah" rend="quotes">white Obeah</name> will have in removing the terrors
    of this professor of the black.
  </p>  
  <p>As to my sick <rs type="properAdjective" ana="#obeah">Obeah</rs> patient, <persName ref="#pickle_0001">Pickle</persName>, from the
     moment of his reconciliation with <rs ref="#edward_0001" type="person">his brother-in-
     law</rs> he began to mend, and has recovered with
     wonderful rapidity: the fellow seems <emph rend="italic">really</emph> grateful
     for the pains which I have taken about him; and 
     our difficulty now is to prevent him fancying himself
     too soon able to quit the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, so eager is
     he to return <said rend="quotes" direct="false">to work for <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>.</said>
  </p>
  <p>There are certainly many excellent qualities in

     to be the being obliged to live perpetually in

   to him in the mountains immediately. <rs type="persGroup">Several
   gentlemen</rs> of the county dined with me to-day,
   and when they left me, one of the carriages contrived 
   to get overturned, and the right shoulder of
   <ecda:anonPers>one of the gentlemen</ecda:anonPers> was dislocated. Luckily, it
   happened close to the house; and as the <ecda:anonPers>physician</ecda:anonPers>
   who attends my estate had dined with me also, <ecda:anonPers>a
   boy</ecda:anonPers>, on a <ecda:fauna>mule</ecda:fauna>, was despatched after him with all
   haste. He was soon with us, the bone was replaced
   with perfect ease, and this morning the
   <ecda:anonPers>patient</ecda:anonPers> left me with every prospect of finding no
   bad effects whatever from his accident.  
  </p>
 <p>We had at dinner a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">land tortoise</ecda:food> and a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">barbecued
    pig</ecda:food>, two of the best and richest dishes that I ever 
    tasted;—the latter, in particular—which was
    dressed in the true maroon fashion, being placed
    on a <distinct type="dialect">barbecue</distinct> (a frame of wicker-work, through
    whose interstices the steam can ascend), filled with
    <ecda:food>peppers and spices</ecda:food> of the highest flavour, wrapt in
    <ecda:food ana="#flora">plantain leaves</ecda:food>, and then buried in a hole filled
    with hot stones, by whose vapour it is baked, no
    particle of the juice being thus suffered to evaporate.
    I have eaten several other good <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>
    dishes, but none so excellent as this, a large portion
    of which was transferred to the most infirm <rs type="persGroup">patients</rs>
    in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>. Perhaps an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> physician would
    have felt every hair of his wig bristle upon his head
    with astonishment, at hearing me ask, this morning,
    a woman in a fever, how her <ecda:flora ana="#medical">bark</ecda:flora> and her <ecda:food ana="#fauna #medical">barbe-
    <pb n="160"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">152</fw>
    cued pig</ecda:food> had agreed with her. But, with negroes,
    I find that feeding the sick upon <ecda:food ana="#fauna">stewed fish</ecda:food> and
    <ecda:food ana="#fauna">pork</ecda:food>, highly seasoned, produces the very best effects
    possible
  </p>
  <p>Some of the fruits here are excellent, such as <ecda:food ana="#flora">shaddocks</ecda:food>,
     <ecda:food ana="#flora">oranges</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#flora">granadelloes</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#flora">forbidden fruit</ecda:food>; and
     one between an <ecda:food ana="#flora">orange</ecda:food> and a <ecda:food ana="#flora">lemon</ecda:food>, called <ecda:food ana="#flora"><distinct type="dialect">the 
     <ecda:food ana="#flora">grape</ecda:food> or cluster fruit</distinct></ecda:food>, appears to me quite delicious.
     For the vegetables, I cannot say so much,
     <ecda:food ana="#flora">yams</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#flora">plantains</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#flora">cocoa poyers</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#flora">yam-poys</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#flora">bananas</ecda:food>,
     &amp;c. look and taste all so much alike, that I
     scarcely know one from the other: they are all
     something between <ecda:food>bread</ecda:food> and <ecda:food ana="#flora">potatoes</ecda:food>, not so
     good as either, and I am quite tired of them all.
     The <ecda:food ana="#flora">Lima Bean</ecda:food> is said to be more like a <ecda:food ana="#flora">pea</ecda:food> than a
     <ecda:food ana="#flora">bean</ecda:food>, but whatever it be like, it appeared to me
     very indifferent. As to <ecda:food ana="#flora">peas</ecda:food> themselves, nothing
     can be worse. The <ecda:food ana="#flora"><distinct type="dialect">achie fruit</distinct></ecda:food> is a kind of vegetable, 
     which generally is fried in <ecda:food>butter</ecda:food>; many people, I
     am told, are fond of it, but I could find no merit in
     it. The <ecda:food ana="#flora">palm-tree</ecda:food> (or <ecda:food ana="#flora"><distinct type="dialect">abba</distinct></ecda:food>, as it is called here)
     produces a long scarlet or reddish brown cone,
     which separates into beads, each of which contains
     a <ecda:food ana="#flora">roasting nut</ecda:food> surrounded by a kind of stringy
     husk—which, being boiled in <ecda:food>salt</ecda:food> and water, upon
     being chewn has a taste of <ecda:food ana="#flora">artichoke</ecda:food>, but the consistence
     is very disagreeable. The only native 
     vegetable, which I like much, is the <ecda:food ana="#flora">ochra</ecda:food>, which
     tastes like <ecda:food ana="#flora">asparagus</ecda:food>, though not with quite so
     delicate a flavour.      
  </p> 
     <pb n="161"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">153</fw>    
  <p>As to fish, the variety is endless; but I think
     it rather consists in variety of names than of flavour.
     From this, however, I must except the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Silk-
     Fish</ecda:food> and <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Mud-Fish</ecda:food>, and above all, the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Mountain-
     Mullet</ecda:food>, which is almost the best fish that I ever
     tasted. All the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">shell-fish</ecda:food>, that I have met with
     as yet, have been excellent; the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">oysters</ecda:food> have
     not come in my way, but I am told that they are
     not only poor and insipid, but frequently are so

<p>There were above <rs type="persGroup">twenty ladies</rs> literally at my
   feet this morning. I went down to the <rs type="place">negro-
   village</rs> to speak to <persName ref="#bessie_0001">Bessie</persName> about going to her
   <rs ref="#ormond_0001" type="person">black doctor</rs>; and all the <rs type="persGroup">refractory females</rs> of
   last week heard of my being there, and came in a
   body to promise better conduct for the future,
   and implore me not to go away. The sight of my
   carriage getting ready to take me to <placeName>Kingston</placeName>,
   and the arrival of <ecda:fauna>post-horses</ecda:fauna>, had alarmed them
   with the idea that I was really going to put my
   threats into execution of leaving them for ever.
   They had artfully enough prevailed on the <ecda:anonPers>wife
   of <persName ref="#clifford_0001">Clifford</persName></ecda:anonPers> (the driver whom <persName ref="whaunica_0001"><sic>Whannica</sic></persName> had collared)
   to be their spokes-woman; and they begged,
   and lifted up their folded hands, and cried, and fell
   on the ground, and kissed my feet—and, in short,
   <pb n="162"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">154</fw>
   acted their part so well, that they almost made me
   act mine to perfection, and fall to blubbering. I
   told them, that I certainly should go to <placeName>Kingston</placeName>
   on Thursday; but if I had good accounts of them
   during my absence, I should return in a few days;—
   if, on the contrary, the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> continued to
   refuse to work without compulsion, then, in justice
   to <rs type="persGroup">the good ones</rs> (who last week were obliged
   to do more than their share), those punishments,
   which I had stopped, must be resumed;—but that,
   as <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> would be unsupportable to me, if I
   could not live there without hearing the crack of
   the abominable <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg> all day long, I would
   not return to it, but ship myself off for <placeName>England</placeName>,
   and never visit them or <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> any more. And
   then I talked very sternly and positively about
   <said rend="quotes">punishments</said> and <said rend="quotes">making bad negroes do
   their work properly,</said> and every third word was
   the <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>, till I almost fancied myself the
   princess in the <title rend="quotes" ref="#perrault_diamonds">Fairy Tale</title>, who never opened
   her mouth, but out came two <ecda:fauna>toads</ecda:fauna> and three 
   couple of <ecda:fauna>serpents</ecda:fauna>. However, to sweeten my oration
   a little at the end, I told them, that, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">having
   enquired closely into the characters of <rs type="persGroup">the present
   book-keepers</rs>, I had found no charge against any
   of them except <ecda:anonPers>one</ecda:anonPers>, who was accused of having
   occasionally struck <ecda:anonPers>a negro</ecda:anonPers>, of using bad language
   to them, and of being a hasty passionate man,
   though in other respects very serviceable to the 
   estate. But although these faults were but trifling,
<pb n="163"/>
<fw type="pageNum">155</fw>    
   and some of them could not be proved, so determined was
   I to show that I would suffer no white person on
   the <rs type="place">estate</rs> who maltreated the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, either by
   word or deed, that I had determined to make an
   example of him for the warning of the rest; and
   accordingly had dismissed him this morning.</said>
</p>    
    <p>The <ecda:anonPers>man</ecda:anonPers> in question (by his own account) had
    made himself obnoxious to them; and on hearing of
    his discharge, they, one and all, sprawled upon the
    ground in such a rapture of joy and gratitude, that
    now I may safely say with <persName ref="#andrew_aguecheek_0001">Sir Andrew Aguecheek</persName>,
    <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_twelfth"><emph rend="italic">I</emph> was adored once!</quote>  
 </p>  
 <p>The <ecda:anonPers>book-keeper</ecda:anonPers> had denied positively the
    charge of striking the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, and ascribed it to
    the revenge of the <name>Eboe</name> <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>, whom he had
    detected in cutting out part of a boiling-house
    window, in order that he might pass out stolen
    <ecda:commodity ana="#food #circulation">sugar</ecda:commodity> unperceived; for, to do the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> justice,
    it is a doubt whether they are the greatest thieves
    or liars, and the quantity of <ecda:commodity ana="#food #circulation">sugar</ecda:commodity> which they purloin
    during the crop, and dispose of at <placeName>the Bay</placeName> for
    a mere trifle, is enormous. However, whether
    the charge of striking were true or not, it was
    sufficiently proved that this <ecda:anonPers>book-keeper</ecda:anonPers> was a
    passionate man, and he said himself, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that the
    <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> had conceived a spite against him,</said> which 
    alone were reasons enough for removing him. Indeed,
    I had the less scruple for the slight nature 
    of his offence making it easy for him to find another
    situation; and I have besides desired him to stay
    <pb n="164"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">156</fw>
    out his quarter on the <rs type="place">estate,</rs> and then receive a
    double salary on going away, which will free him
    from any charge of having been dismissed disgracefully.

<p>I went to enquire after my petitioners <persName ref="juliet_0002">Juliet</persName> and
   <persName ref="#delia_0001">Delia</persName>, and had the satisfaction to find that the <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>

   every thing that was right and necessary. <persName ref="aberdeen_0001">Aberdeen</persName>,
   too, the runaway cooper, who had applied to me to
   obtain his pardon, had been suffered to return to his
   work unpunished; and as it had been found that
   his flight had in a great measure been occasioned by
   his being in a bad state of health, which rendered
   him apprehensive of being put to labour beyond
   his strength, he had been permitted to select his
   own occupation, which, of course, was the easiest
   one in the trade. But I found it a more difficult
   matter to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the
   charges brought to me on Sunday last: the books
   positively contradicted them, but the register 
   might have been falsely kept; and as the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
   persisted most positively in their complaint against

<p>I left <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> for <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName> at six in the

   son of my next neighbour, <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName> of <placeName>Amity</placeName>, who
   not only was good enough to lend me a kittereen,
   with a canopy, to perform my journey, but <rs ref="#hill_0002" type="person">his son</rs>
   to be my <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="it">cicerone</foreign> on my tour. The road wound

   reached a solitary tavern, called <placeName>Blue-fields</placeName>, where
   the <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> rested for a couple of hours. It had a
   very pretty garden on the sea-shore, which contained
   a picturesque cottage, exactly resembling
   and ornamental Hermitage; and leaning against
   one of the pillars of its porch we found a young 
   girl, who exactly answered <persName ref="#george_colman_1762">George Colman's</persName> description
   of <persName ref="#yarico_0001">Yarico</persName>, <quote rend="quotes" source="colman_inkle">quite brown, but extremely

   and the owner of a tavern being a relation of

   <fw type="pageNum">158</fw> 
   <ecda:anonPers>her mother</ecda:anonPers>, he had permitted the <rs type="persGroup">fugitives</rs> to

   She talked perfectly good <name>English</name>, for she said that
   there were many of that nation established in <placeName>Providence</placeName>.
   Her name was <persName ref="#antoinetta_0001">Antoinetta</persName>. Her figure was
   light and elegant; her black eyes mild and bright;

<p>Yesterday the only very striking point of view
   (although the whole of the road was picturesque)
   was <placeName rend="quotes">the Cove</placeName>, situated between <placeName>Blue-fields</placeName> and
   <placeName>Lakovia</placeName>, and which resembled the most beautiful
   of the views of coves to be found in <title rend="quotes" ref="#cooks_journals"><persName ref="#james_cook_1728">Cook's</persName> Voyages</title>;
   but our journey to-day was a succession of 
   <pb n="167"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">159</fw>
  beautiful scenes, from beginning to end. Instantly on
  leaving <placeName rend="quotes">the Gutters</placeName>, we began to ascend the
  <geogName>May-day Mountains</geogName>, and it was not till after travelling 
   for <measure>five and twenty miles</measure>, that we found ourselves
   at the foot of them on the other side, at a place
   called <placeName>Williamsfield</placeName>, about <measure>twelve miles</measure> from the
  <rs type="place">toll-house</rs>, where we rested for the night. To be
   sure, the road was so rough, that it was enough
   to make one envy the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> women, who,
   having no souls at all, could not possibly have them
   jolted out of their bodies; but the beauty of the
   scenery amply rewarded us for our bruised sides
   and battered backs. The road was, for the most 
   part, bounded by lofty rocks on one side, and a
   deep precipice on the other, and bordered with a
   profusion of noble trees and <ecda:flora>flowering shrubs</ecda:flora> in
   great variety. In particular, I was struck with the 
   picturesque appearance of some wild <ecda:flora ana="#food">fig-trees</ecda:flora> of 
   singular size and beauty. Although there were 
   only two of us, besides <rs type="persGroup">servants</rs>, we found it necessary
   to employ seven <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> and a couple of <ecda:fauna>mules</ecda:fauna>;
   and, as our cavalcade wound along through the

   and of our kittereens (which are precisely the

    the church, which is a very handsome one; the
    walls lined with fine mahogany, and ornamented
    with many monuments of white marble, in memory 
    of the former governors and other principal inhabitants.
    It seems that my ancestors, on both sides,
    have always had a tasted for being well lodged after
    their decease; for, on admiring one of these tombs,
    it proved to be that of my <rs type="person" ref="#thomas_sewell_1710">maternal grandfather</rs>;
    but this was still not to be compared for a moment
    with my mausoleum at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>. After church I
    went home with the <ecda:anonPers>Rector</ecda:anonPers>, who is one of the ecclesiastical
    commissaries, and had a long conversation
    with him respecting a plan which is in agitation for
    giving the <rs>negroes</rs> something of a religious education.
    We afterwards dined with the <ecda:anonPers>the member for
    <placeName>Westmoreland</placeName></ecda:anonPers>; and as every body in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> is
    on foot by six in the morning, at ten in the evening
    we were quite ready to go to bed.

 <p>The <rs type="person" ref="#john_lewis_1775">Chief Justice</rs> went with me to <placeName>Kingston</placeName>,
    where I had appointed the <ecda:anonPers>agent</ecda:anonPers> for my other
    <rs type="place">estate</rs> in <placeName>St. Thomas's-in-the-East</placeName> to meet me.
    The short time alotted for my stay in the <rs type="place">island</rs>

    estate</rs> and to <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> at this first visit, and therefore
    I determined to confine my attention to the
    negroes on <rs type="place">the latter estate</rs> till my return to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.
    I now contented myself by impressing on 
    the mind of <ecda:anonPers>my agent</ecda:anonPers> (whom I am certain of being
    a most humane and intelligent man) my extreme
    anxiety for the abolition of the <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>; and I
    had the satisfaction of hearing from him, that for a
    long time it had never been used more then perhaps 
    twice in the year, and then only very slightly,
    and for some offence so flagrant that it was impossible
    to pass it over; and he assured me, that
    whenever I visit <placeName>Hordley</placeName>, I may depend upon its
    not being employed at all. On the other hand, I am
    told that a gentleman of the <placeName>parish of Vere</placeName>, who
    came over to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> for the sole purpose of ameliorating 
    the condition of <rs type="persGroup">his negroes</rs>, after abolishing 
    the <seg ana="#punishment">cart-whip</seg>, has at length been constrained
    to resume the occasional use of it, because he
    found it utterly impossible to keep them in any
    sort or subordination without it. 
 </p>   
 <p>There is not that air of melancholy about <placeName>Kingston</placeName>
    which pervades <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName>; but it has
    no pretensions to beauty; and if any person will
    imagine a large town entirely composed of booths
    at a race-course, and the streets merely roads,
    without any sort of paving, he will have a perfect
    idea of <placeName>Kingston</placeName>

<p>The <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> canoes are hollowed <ecda:flora>cotton-trees</ecda:flora>. 
   We embarked in one of them at six in the morning,
   and visited the ruins of <placeName>Port Royal</placeName>, which, last
   year, was destroyed by fire: some of the houses
   were rebuilding; but it was a melancholy sight, not
   only from the look of the half-burnt buildings, but
   the dejected countenances of the ruined inhabitants.
   I returned to breakfast at the rectory, with
   <rs type="persGroup">two other ecclesiastical commissaries</rs>; had more
   conversation about their proposed plan; and became
   still more convinced of the difficulty of doing any
   thing effectual without danger to the <rs type="place">island</rs> and to
   the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> themselves, and of the extreme delicacy
   requisite in whatever may be attempted. 
   We afterwards visited the school of the <rs type="persGroup">children of
      the poor</rs>, who are educating upon <persName ref="#andrew_bell_1753">Dr. Bell's</persName> system;
   and then saw the church, a very large and
   handsome one on the inside, but mean eanough as
   to its exterior. I was shown the tombstone of
   <persName ref="#john_benbow_1653">Admiral Benbow</persName>, who was killed in a naval engagement,
   and whose ship afterwards
   <quote rend="quotes" source="admiral_benbow">

      </lg>
   </quote>
 as the admiral's <name>Homer</name> informs us. 
</p>
<p>The church is a large one, but it is going to be
   still further extended; the negroes in <placeName>Kingston</placeName> and 
   its neighbourhood being (as the <ecda:anonPers>rector</ecda:anonPers> assured me)
   <pb n="172"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">164</fw>
   so anxious to obtain religious instruction, that on
   Sundays not only the church but the churchyard is
   so completely thronged with them, as to make it
   difficult to traverse the crowd; and those who are
   fortunate enough to obtain seats for the morning 
   service, through fear of being excluded from that 
   of the evening, never stir out of the <rs type="place">church</rs> during 
   the whole day. They also flock to be baptized in 
   great numbers, and many have lately come to be
   married; and their burials and christenings are
   performed with great pomp and solemnity.    
</p>
<p>One of the most intelligent of the negroes with
   whom I have yet conversed, was the <ecda:anonPers>coxswain</ecda:anonPers> of my
   <placeName>Port Royal</placeName> canoe. I asked him whether he had
   been christened? He answered, no; he did not yet
   think himself good enough, but he hoped to be so in
   time. Nor was he married; for he was still young,
   and afraid that he could not break off his bad habits,
   and be contented to live with no other woman than 
   his wife; and so he thought it better not to become
   a <name>Christian</name> till he could feel certain of performing
   the duties of it. However, he said, he had at least
   cured himself of one bad custom, and never worked
   upon Sundays, except on some very urgent necessity.
   I asked what he did on Sundays instead: did
   he go to church?—No. Or employ himself in
   learning to read?—Oh, no; though he thought
   being able to read <mcr rend="italic">was a great virtue</mcr>; (which was
   his constant expression for any thing right, pleasant,
   or profitable;) but he had no leisure to learn 
   <pb n="173"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">165</fw>
   <choice><sic>no</sic><corr>on</corr></choice> week days, and as he had heard the parson say
   that Sunday ought to be a day of rest, he made a 
   point of doing nothing at all on that day. He
   praised <ecda:anonPers>his former master</ecda:anonPers>, of whose <ecda:anonPers>son</ecda:anonPers> he was now
   the property, and said that neither of them ahd
   ever occasion to lay a finger on him. He worked
   as a waterman, and paid <ecda:anonPers>his master</ecda:anonPers> <measure ana="#currency">ten shillings</measure> a
   week, the rest of his earnings being his own profit; 
   and when he owed wages for three months, if he
   brought two <ecda:anonPers>his master</ecda:anonPers> would always give him
   time for the remainder, and that in so kind a manner,
   that he always fretted himself to think that so
   kind a master should wait for his rights, and worked
   twice as hard till the dept was discharged. He
   said that kindness was the only way to make good
   negroes, and that, if <emph rend="italic">that</emph> failed, flogging would never
   succeed; and he advised me, when I found my 
   negro worthless, <said rend="quotes">to sell him at once, and not stay
   to flog him, and so, by spoiling his appearance,
   make him sell for less; for blacks must not be
   treated now, <distinct>massa</distinct>, as they used to be; they can
   think, and hear, and see, as well as white people:
   blacks are wiser, <distinct>massa</distinct>, than they were, and will
   soon be still wiser.</said> I thought the fellow himself
   was a good proof of his assertion.  
</p>
<p><seg ana="#performance">I left <placeName>Kingston</placeName> at two o'clock, in defiance of a
   broiling sun; reached <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName> in time to
   dine with the <ecda:anonPers>Attorney-General</ecda:anonPers>; and went afterwards

   enough, but, I am told, very inferior in splendour to
   that in <placeName>Kingston</placeName>. As to the performance, it was 
   about equal to any provincial theatricals that iI ever
   saw in <placeName>England</placeName>; although the pieces represented
   were by no means well selected, being entirely
   musical, and the orchestra consisting of nothing
   more than a couple of fiddles.</seg> My stay in <placeName>Spanish
   Town</placeName> has been too short to admit of my inspecting
   the antiquities of it, which must be reserved for a

   was very sensible, both at <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName> and <placeName>Kingston</placeName>;
   and the suffocating closeness made me long
   to breathe again in the country.   
</p>
<p>The <rs type="person" ref="#william_montagu_1771">governor</rs> happened to be absent on a tour
   in the north; but I had an opportunity of seeing
   many of the principal persons of the island during
   my residence here; and the civilities which I received 
   from all of them were not only more than I
   expected, but such as I should be unreasonable if
   I had desired more, and very ungrateful if I could
   ever forget them.

<p>We were to return by the <placeName>North Road</placeName>, and set 
   out at six in the morning. The first stage was to
   the <placeName>West Tavern</placeName>, <measure>nineteen miles</measure>; and nothing can
   be imagined at once more sublime and more beau-
   <pb n="175"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">167</fw>
   tiful than the scenery. Our road lay along the
   banks of the <geogName>Rio Cobre</geogName>, which runs up to <placeName>Spanish
   Town</placeName>, where its floods frequently commit dreadful
   ravages. Large masses of rock intercept its current
   at small intervals, which, as well as its shallowness,
   render it unnavigable. The cliffs and
   <ecda:flora>trees</ecda:flora> are of the most gigantic size, and the road
   goes so near the brink of a tremendous precipice,
   that we were obliged always to send <rs type="person">a servant</rs> forwards
   to warn any other carriage of our approach,
   in order that it might stay in some broader part
   while we passed it. A bridge had been attempted
   to be built over the river, but a storm had demolished
   it before its completion, and nothing was
   now left standing but a single enormous arch. In 
   like manner <geogName rend="quotes">the Dry River</geogName> sets all bridges
   at defiance: when we crossed it between <placeName>Old Harbour</placeName>
   and <placeName>Spanish Town</placeName>, it was nothing but a
   waste of sand; but its floods frequently pour down
   with irresistable strength and rapidity, and sometimes
   render it impassible for weeks together. I
   was extremely delighted with the first <measure>ten miles</measure> of
   this stage: unluckily, a mist then arose, so thick, 
   that it was utterly impossible even to guess at the
   surrounding scenery; and the morning was so cold,
   that I was very glad to wrap myself up in my cloak
   as closely as if I had been travelling in an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> 
   December.  
</p>
<p>By the time of our leaving the <placeName>West Tavern</placeName>
   the mist had dispersed, and I was able to ad-
   <pb n="176"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">168</fw>
   mire the extraordinary beauty of <geogName>Mount Diavolo</geogName>,
   which we were then crossing. Though we had
   left the river, the road was still a narrow shelf of
   rock running along the edge of ravines of great
   depth, and filled with broken masses of stone and
   trees of wonderful magnitude; only that at intervals
   we emerged for a time into places resembling
   ornamental parks in <placeName>England</placeName>, the lawns being of
   the liveliest verdure, the ground rising and falling
   with an endless variety of surface, and enriched
   with a profusion of trees majestic in stature and
   picturesque in their shapes, many of them entirely
   covered with the beautiful flowers of <distinct rend="quotes"><ecda:flora>hogsmeat</ecda:flora></distinct>,
   and other <ecda:flora>creeping plants</ecda:flora>. The <ecda:flora>logwood</ecda:flora>, too, is 
   now perfectly golden with its full bloom, and perfumes 
   all the air; and nothing can be more gay
   than the quantity of wild flowers which catch the
   eye on all sides, particularly the <ecda:flora>wild pine</ecda:flora>, and the
   <ecda:flora>wild ipecacuanha</ecda:flora>. We travelled for <measure>sixteen miles</measure>,
   which brought us to our harbour for the night,—
   a solitary tavern called <placeName>Blackheath</placeName>, situated in the
   heart of the mountains of <geogName>St. Anne</geogName>.    
</p>

<p>The road soon brought us down to the very
   brink of the sea, which we continued to skirt
   during the whole of the stage. It then brought us
   to <placeName>St. Anne's Bay</placeName>, where we found an excellent
   breakfast, at an in quite in the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> fashion,—
   for the <ecda:anonPers>landlady</ecda:anonPers> had long been resident in <placeName>Great
 <pb n="177"/>
 <fw type="pageNum">169</fw>
   Britain</placeName>. Every thing was clean and comfortable,
   and the windows looked full upon the sea. This
   stage was <measure>sixteen miles</measure>: the next was said to be
   <measure>twenty-five</measure>; but from the time which we took to
   travel it,  I can scarcely believe it to be so much. 
   Our road still lay by the sea-side, till we began to
   ascend the mountain of <geogName>Rio Bueno</geogName>; from which
   we at length perceived the river itself funning into
   the sea. It was at <placeName>Porto Bueno</placeName> that <persName ref="#christopher_columbus_1450">Columbus</persName>
   is said to have made his first landing on the <rs type="place">island</rs>. 
   <placeName>Rio Bueno</placeName> is a small town with a fort, situated
   close to the sea. Here we also found a very good
   inn, kept by a <ecda:anonPers>Scotchman</ecda:anonPers>.
</p>
<p>The present landlady (her father being from
   home) was a very pretty brown girl, by name <persName ref="eliza_thompson_0001">Eliza
   Thompson</persName>. She told me that she was only residing
   with her parents during <ecda:anonPers>her <emph rend="italic">husband's</emph></ecda:anonPers> absence; for
   she was (it seems) the <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</foreign> wife of an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
   <ecda:anonPers>merchant</ecda:anonPers> in <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, and had a house on <placeName>Tachy's
   Bridge</placeName>. This kind of establishment is the highest
   object of the <emph rend="italic">brown</emph> females of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; they seldom
   marry men of their own colour, but lay themselves out
   to captivate some white person, who takes
   them for mistresses, under the appellation of housekeepers.   
</p>
 <p>Soon after my arrival at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, I asked <ecda:anonPers>my
    attorney</ecda:anonPers> whether a lever-looking brown woman,
    who seemed to have great authority in the house,
    belonged to me?—No; she was a free woman.
    —Was she in my service, then? No; she was
    <pb n="178"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">170</fw>
    not in my service. I began to grow impatient.
    —<said rend="quotes">But what <emph rend="quotes">does</emph> she do at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>? Of what
    use is she in the house?</said>—<said rend="quotes">Why sir, as to
    use....of no great use, sir;</said> and then, after
    a pause, he added in a lower voice, <said rend="quotes">It is the
    custom, sir, in this country, for unmarried me to
    have housekeepers, and <persName ref="#nancy_0001">Nancy</persName> is mine.</said> But he
    was unjust in saying that <persName ref="#nancy_0001">Nancy</persName> is of no use on
    the <rs type="place">estate</rs>; for she is perpetually in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>,
    nurses the <rs type="persGroup">children</rs>, can bleed, and mix up medicine,
    and (as I am assured) she is of more service 
    to the sick than all the <rs type="persGroup">doctors</rs>. These brown
    housekeepers generally attach themselves so sincerely
    to the interests of their protectors, and make
    themselves so useful, that they in common retain
    their situation; and their children (if slaves) are
    always honoured by their fellows with the title of
    Miss. My mulatto housemaid is always called
    <persName ref="polly_0001" rend="quotes">Miss Polly</persName> by her fellow-servant <persName ref="phillis_0001">Phillis</persName>. This
    kind of connection is considered by a brown girl
    in the same light as marriage. They will tell you,
    with an air of vanity, <said rend="quotes">I am <name>Mr. Such-a-one's</name>
    <emph rend="italic">Love</emph>!</said> and always speak of him as being her <emph rend="italic">husband</emph>;
    and I am told, that, except on these terms,
    it is extremely difficult to obtain the favours of a
    woman of colour. To gain the situation of housekeeper 
    to a white man, the mulatto girl

  <p>On our return from dinner at <persName ref="dewer_0001">Mr Dewer's</persName>, we

     had <rs type="persGroup">two nieces</rs> there, under her auspices we

     the assertion was a mistake, arising from such a

     generally preferring to live with white men, and
     the brown men having thus no other resource
     than the black women. As to the above <rs type="persGroup">girls</rs>, the

   <p>I reached <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> about three o'clock, after an

       though we travelled at all hours, and with as

      I never felt a headach exept for one half hour.

      <rs type="place">My estate in the west</rs> is burnt up for want of

      of my crop. At <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, not a drop of rain has
      fallen since the <date when="1815-11-16">16th of November</date>. Not a vestige
      of verdure is to be seen; and we begin to apprehend
      a famine among the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> in consequence
      of the drought destroying their <rs type="place">provision grounds</rs>. 
      This alone is wanting to complete the dangerous
      state of the <rs type="place">island</rs>; where the higher classes are
      all in the utmost alarm at rumours of <persName ref="#william_wilberforce_1759">Wilberforce's</persName>
      intentions to set the negroes entirely at freedom;
      the next step to which would be, in all probability,
      a general massacare of the whites, and a
      secnd part of the horrors of <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>: while,
      on the other hand, the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are impatient at
      the delay; and such disturbances arose in <placeName>St.
      Thomas's in the East</placeName>, last <name>Christmas</name>, as required
      the interposition of the magistrates. They say
      <pb n="182"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">174</fw>
      that the <rs type="persGroup">negroes of that parish</rs> had taken it into

      actually determined upon setting them all at liberty
      at once on the first day of the present year, but
      that the interference of the island had defeated
      the plan. Their discontent was most carefully
      and artfully fomented by some brown <name>Methodists</name>,
      who held secret and nightly meetings on the different 
      estates, and did their best to mislead and
      bewilder these poor creatures with their fantastic
      and absurd preaching. These fellows harp upon
      sin, and <name>the devil</name>, and hell-fire incessantly, and
      describe the <name>Almighty</name> and the <name>Saviour</name> as beings
      so terrible, that many of their proselytes cannot
      hear the name of <persName ref="jesus_christ_0000">Christ</persName> without shuddering. <ecda:anonPers>One
      poor negro</ecda:anonPers>, on one of my own estates, told <ecda:anonPers>the
      overseer</ecda:anonPers> that he knew himself to be so great a
      sinner that nothing could save him from <name>the devil's</name>
      clutches, even for a few hours, except singing
      hymns; and he kept singing so incessantly day
      and night, that at length terror and want of sleep
      turned his brain, and the wretch died raving mad.

<p>A <persName ref="#charles_price_1708">Sir Charles Price</persName>, who had an estate in this

 <p>Two <ecda:fauna><placeName>Jamaica</placeName> nightingales</ecda:fauna> have established themselves
    on the <ecda:flora ana="#food">orange tree</ecda:flora> which grows against my

    is also called <distinct type="scientific" rend="quotes"><ecda:fauna>the mocking-bird</ecda:fauna></distinct>, from its facility
    of imitating, not only the notes of every other

    the house near which it resides, after which it will

 <p>But by far the most curious animal that I have

    in proportion to its limbs, that nothing can be more
    curious or admirable than the machinery by which it
    is enabled to fold them up instantly on the slightest

    once a year travel in large troops down to the seaside
    to spawn and change their shells. If I recollect
    right, <persName ref="#oliver_goldsmith_1730">Goldsmith</persName> gives a very full and entertaining

    that which was brought to me was a

    <ecda:fauna>snail's</ecda:fauna>, although the animal itself, when marching
    with his house on his back, appears to be above
    thrice the size; but I am told that they are frequently
    as large as a man's fist. Mine was found
    alone in the public road: how it came to be in so
    solitary a state, I know not, for in general they
    move in armies, and march towards the sea in a
    straight line; I am afraid, by his being found alone,
    that my soldier must have been a deserter.

 <p>The rain has brought forth the <ecda:fauna>fire-flies</ecda:fauna>, and in the
    evening the hedges are all brilliant with their numbers.
    In the day they seem to be torpid <ecda:fauna>beetles</ecda:fauna> of a
    dull reddish colour, buat at night they become of a
    shining purple. The fire proceeds from two small
    spots in the back part of the head. It is yellow in
    the light, and requires motion to throw out its radience
    in perfection; but as soon as it is touched, the
    <ecda:fauna>fly</ecda:fauna> struggles violently, and bends itself together with
    a clicking noise like the snap of a spring; and I
    understand that this effort is necessary to set it in 
    motion. It is sufficiently strong to turn itself upwards
    with a single movement, if lying on its
    back: some people say that it is always obliged to
    throw itself upon its back in order to take wing;
    but this I have, again, heard others contradict.
    When confined in a glass, the light seems almost
    extinguished; nothing can be discered but two
    pale yellow spots; but on being pressed by the hand
    it becomes more brilliant than any emerald, and
    when on the wing it seems entirely composed of 
    the most beautifully coloured fire.

  <fw type="pageNum">179</fw>  
    girl of fifteen, called <persName ref="#minetta_0001">Minetta</persName>: she acknowledged
    the having infused corrosive sublimate in some
    <ecda:food>brandy and water</ecda:food>; but had asserted that she had taken
    it from the medicine chest without knowing it to
    be poison, and had given it to her master at <ecda:anonPers>her
    grandmother's</ecda:anonPers> desire.</seg> This account was evidently
    a fabrication: there was no doubt of the <ecda:anonPers>grandmother's</ecda:anonPers>
    innocence, although some suspicion attached 
    to the <ecda:anonPers>mother's</ecda:anonPers> influence; but as to the 
    girl herself, nothing could be more hardened than
    her conduct through the whole transaction. She
    stood by the bed to see <ecda:anonPers>her master</ecda:anonPers> drink the poison;
    witnessed his agonies without one expression of
    surprise or pity; and when she was ordered to leave
    the room, she pretended to be fast asleep, and not
    to hear what was said to her. Even since her imprisonment,
    she could never be prevailed upon to 
    say that she was sorry for <ecda:anonPers>her master's</ecda:anonPers> having been
    poisoned; and she told the people in the gaol, that
    <said direct="false" rend="quotes">they could do nothing to her, for she had turned

    without the least emotion; and I am told,
    that when she went down the steps of the courthouse,
    she was seen to laugh.     
 </p>
 <p>The trial appeared to be conducted with all possible

    no lawyers employed on either side; consequently
    no appeals to the passions, no false lights thrown

    examinings, and no brow-beating of witnesses; and
    I cannot say that the tiral appeared to me to go on
    at all the worse. Nobody appeared to be either for
    or against the prisoner; the only object of all present
    was evidently to come at the truth, and I sincerely
    believe that they obtained their object. The 
    only part of the trial of which I disapproved was the
    ordering the culprit to such immediate execution,
    that sufficient time was not allowed for the exercise
    of the toyal prerogative, should the <rs type="person" ref="#william_montagu_1771">governor</rs>

     have had a very fair hearing. The journals of <rs type="place">the

     upon oath; and in order to make out a

     spite of their gross falsehoods and calumnies; and
     although they did not gain their object, I make no
     doubt that they will go on more contentedly for
     having had attention paid to their complaints. It
     was indeed evident, that <persName ref="#nelly_0001">Nelly</persName> (the chief complainant)
     was actuated more by wounded pride 
     than any real feeling of hardship; for what she
     laid the most stress upon was, the <ecda:anonPers>overseer's</ecda:anonPers> turning

  <p>There are so many pleasing and amusing parts
     of the character of negroes, that it seems to me
     scarcely possible not to like them. But when they
     are once disposed to evil, they seem to set no
     bounds to the indulgence of their bad passions. <rs type="person" ref="#jenny_0001">A 
        poor girl</rs> came into the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> to-day, who had had
     some trifling dispute with <rs type="persGroup">two of her companions</rs>;
     on which the <rs type="persGroup">two friends</rs> seized her together, and
     each fixing her teeth on one of the girl's hands,
     bit her so severely, that we greatly fear her losing
     the use of both of them. I happened also to ask,
     this morning, to whom a skull had belonged,
     which I had observed fixed on a pole by the roadside,
     when returning last from <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName>. I was
     told, that about five years ago a <persName ref="#dunbar_0001">Mr. Dunbar</persName> had
     given some discontent to his negroes in the article
     of clothing them, although, in other respects, he
     was by no means a severe master. However, this
     was sufficient to induce <ecda:anonPers>his head driver</ecda:anonPers>, who had 
     <pb n="190"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">182</fw>
     been brought up in his own house from infancy, to
     form a plot among the slaves to assassinate him;
     and he was assisted in this laudable design by <rs type="persGroup">two
     young men</rs> from a neighbouring property, who
     barely knew <persName ref="#dunbar_0001">Mr. Dunbar</persName> by sight, had no enmity
     against him whatever, and only joined in the conspiracy
     in compliment to their worthy friend <ecda:anonPers>the
     driver</ecda:anonPers>. During several months a variety of attempts 
     were made for effecting their purpose; but
     accident defeated them; till at length they were
     made certain of his intention to dine out at some
     distance, and of his being absolutely obliged to
     return in the evening. An ambuscade was therefore
     laid to intercept him; and on his passing a clump
     of <ecda:flora>trees</ecda:flora>, the <rs type="persGroup">assassins</rs> sprang upon him, <ecda:anonPers>the
     driver</ecda:anonPers> knocked him from his horse, and in a few
     moments their clubs despatched him. No one
     suspected the <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers>; but in the course of enquiry,
     his house as well as the other was searched, and
     not only <persName ref="#dunbar_0001">Mr. Dunbar's</persName> watch was found concealed
     there, but with it one of his ears, which the villain
     had carried away, from a negro belief that, as long
     as the murderer possesses one of the ears of his
     victim, he will never be haunted by his spectre.
     The <rs type="persGroup">stranger-youths</rs>, two of <persName ref="#dunbar_0001">Dunbar's</persName> negroes,
     and the <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers>, were tried, confessed the crime, and
     were all executed; the head of the latter being
     fixed upon a pole <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</foreign>. But while the
     offenders were still in prison, the <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers> upon a 
     neighbouring property had occasion to find fault
     <pb n="191"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">183</fw>
     in the field with <ecda:anonPers>a woman</ecda:anonPers> belonging to a gang
     hired to perform some particular work; upon
     which she flew upon him with the greatest fury, 
     grasped him by the throat, cried to <rs type="persGroup">her fellows</rs>
     —<said rend="quotes">Come here! come here! Let us <persName ref="#dunbar_0001">Dunbar</persName> him!</said>
     and through her strength and the suddenness of
     her attack had nearly accomplished her purpose, before
     his <rs type="persGroup">own slaves</rs> could come to his assistance.
     <ecda:anonPers>This woman</ecda:anonPers> was also executed.      
  </p>
  <p>This happened about five years ago, when <rs type="place">the
  mountains</rs> were in a very rebellious state. Every
  thing there is at present quiet. But only last year a
  book-keeper belonging to the next estate to me was

  discover the murderer.

     As the <rs type="persGroup">ecclesiastical commissaries</rs> had

     of the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> for religious instruction, I was
     desirous of learning what progress had been made 
     in this quarter, and this morning I went over to
     see <ecda:anonPers>one of the teachers</ecda:anonPers>. He told me, that he
     and <ecda:anonPers>his wife</ecda:anonPers> had jointly used their best efforts to
     produce a sense of religion in the minds of <rs type="persGroup">the

     <pb n="192"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">184</fw>
     but that he could not say that they showed any
     great avidity on the subject. It seems that there
     are at least <rs type="persGroup">three hundred negroes</rs> on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>;
    the number of believers has rather increased than
    diminished, to be sure, but still in a very small
    proportion. When <ecda:anonPers>this gentleman arrived, there</ecda:anonPers>
     were not more than <rs type="persGroup">forty baptised persons</rs>: he has
     been here upwards of five years, and still the
     number of persons <said rend="quotes" direct="false">belonging to his church</said>
     (as he expressed it) does not exceed fifty. Of these,
     seldom more than ten or a dozen attend his lectures
     at a time. As to the remaining two hundred 
     and fifty, they take no more notice of his lectures
     or his exhortations, than if there were no such person
     on the property, are only very civil to him when
     they see him, and go on their own old way,
     without suffering him to interfere in any shape. 
     By the <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers> of <placeName>Greenwich's</placeName> express desire,
     the <ecda:anonPers><name>Moravian</name></ecda:anonPers> has, however, agreed to give up an
     hour every day for the religious instruction of the
     <rs type="persGroup">negro children</rs> on that property: and I should
     certainly request him to extend his labours to
     <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, if I did not think it right to give the
     <orgName>Church of England</orgName> <rs type="persGroup">clergymen</rs> full room for a trial
     of their intended periodical visitations; which
     would not be the case, if the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> were to be
     interfered with by the professors of any other
     communtion: otherwise I am myself ready to give
     free ingress and egress upon my several estates

  </p>
  <p>For my own part, I have no hope of any material
     benefit arising from these religious visitations made
     at quarterly intervals. It seems to me as nugatory

    produce. It was a straight hard outline, without
    shade or perspective; the hair was a large black
    patch, and the face covered with an uniform layer
    of flesh-colour, with a red spot in the centre of 
    each cheek. As to likeness, there was not even
    an attempt to take any. But still, such as they 
    were, there were eyes, nose, and mouth, to be sure.   
 </p>
 <p>A long red nose supplied the place of my own
    snub; an enormous pair of whiskers stretched themselves
    to the very corner of my mouth; and in place
    of three hairs and a half, the painter, in the super-
    abundance of his generosity, bestowed upon me a
    pair of eye-brows more bushy than <persName ref="#samuel_johnson_1709">Dr. Johnson's</persName>, 
    and which, being formed in an exact semicircle,
    made the eyes beneath them stare with an expression 
    of the utmost astonishment. The <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, 
    however, are in the highest admiration of the
    <pb n="194"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">186</fw>
    painter's skill, and consider the portrait as a striking
    resemblance; for there is a very blue coat with
    very yellow buttons, and white gaiters and trowsers,
    and an eye-glass so big and blue, that it
    looks as if I had hung a pewter plate about my 
    neck; and a bunch of watch-seals larger than those
    with which <persName ref="#alexander_pope_1688">Pope</persName> has decorated <persName ref="#belinda_0001">Belinda's</persName> great

    In the midst of his raptures he dropped the picture,
    and fractured the frame-glass. His despair

 <p>On the Sunday after my first arrival, the <rs type="persGroup">whole
    body of <name>Eboe</name> negroes</rs> came to me to complain of
    the <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers>, and more particularly of <ecda:anonPers>one of the 
    book-keepers </ecda:anonPers>. I listened to them, if not with unwearied
    patience, at least with unsubdued fortitude,
    for above an hour and a half; and finding
    <pb n="196"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">188</fw>
    some grounds for their complaint against the latter,
    in a few days I went down to their quarter of the
    <rs type="place">village</rs>, told them that to please them I had discharged
    the <ecda:anonPers>book-keeper</ecda:anonPers>, named a date for examining
    their other grievances, and listened to them for
    an hour more. When the day of trial came, they
    sent me word that they were perfectly satisfied,
    and had no complaint to make. I was, therefore, 
    much surprised to receive a visit from <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName>, the
    <name>Eboe</name>, yesterday evening, who informed me, that
    during my absence his fellows had formed a plan
    of making a complaint <foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">en masse</foreign> to a neighbouring
    magistrate; and that, not only against the <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers>,
    but against myself <quote rend="quotes">for not listening to them when
    they were injured</quote>; and <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> claimed great 
    merit with me for having prevented their taking
    this step, and convinced them, that while I was on
    the estate myself, there could be no occasion for
    applying to a third person. Now, having made
    me aware of my great obligations to him, here
    <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> meant the matter to rest; but being a 
    good deal incensed at their ingratitude, I instantly
    sent for the <name>Eboes</name>, and enquired into the matter;
    when it appeared, that <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> (who is a clever
    fellow, and has great influence over the rest) had
    first goaded them into a resolution of complaining
    to a magistrate, had then stopped them from putting
    their plan into execution, and that the whole
    was a plot of <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward's</persName>, in order to make a merit
    with me for himself at the expense of his country-
    <pb n="197"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">189</fw>
    men. However, as they confessed their having
    had the intention of applying to <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName> as a
    magistrate, I insisted upon their executing their
    intention. I told them, that as <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName> was the 
    person whom they had selected for their protector,
    to <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName> they should go; that they should either
    make their complaint to him against me, or confess
    that they had been telling lines, and had no complaint
    to make; and that, as the next day was to
    be a play-day given them by me, instead of passing
    it at home in singing and dancing, they should
    pass it at the <placeName>Bay</placeName> in stating their grievances.    
 </p>
 <p>This threw them into terrible confusion; they
    cried out that they wanted to make no complaint
    whatever, and that it was all <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward's</persName> fault, who
    had misled them. <rs type="persGroup">Three of them</rs>, one after the other,
    gave him the lie to his face; and each one and all
    (<persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> as well as the rest) declared that go to <placeName>the
    Bay</placeName> they absolutely would <emph rend="italic">not</emph>. The next morning
    they were all at the door waiting for my coming
    out: they positively refused to go to <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName>, and
    begged and prayed, and humbled themselves; now
    scraping and bowing to me, and then blackguarding
    <persName ref="#edward_0001">Edward</persName> with all their might and main; and
    when I ordered the <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers> to take charge of them,
    and carry them to <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName>, <rs type="persGroup">some of them</rs> fairly
    took to their heels, and ran away. However, <rs type="persGroup">the
    rest</rs> soon brought them back again, for they swore
    that if one went, all should go; and away they
    were marched, in <rs type="persGroup">a string of about twenty</rs>, with 
    <pb n="198"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">190</fw>
    the <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers> at their head. When they got to <placeName>the
    Bay</placeName>, they told <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. Hill</persName> that, as to their <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>,
    they had no complaint to make against him, except
    that he had compelled them to make one; and
    what they said against the <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers> was so trifling,
    that the magistrate bade the <ecda:anonPers>driver</ecda:anonPers> take them
    all back again. Upon which they slunk away to
    their houses, while the <name>Creoles</name> cried out <said rend="quotes">Shame!
    shame!</said> as they passed along.  
 </p>
 <p>Indeed, the <name>Creoles</name> could not have received a
    greater pleasure than the mortification of the
    <name>Eboes</name>; for the two bodies hate each other as
    cordially as the <name>Guelphs</name> and <name>Ghibellines</name>; and
    after their departure for the <placeName>Bay</placeName>, I heard the
    head cook haranguing a <rs type="persGroup">largue audience</rs>, and declaring
    it to be her fixed opinion, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>
    ought to sell all the <name>Eboes</name>, and buy <name>Creoles</name> instead.</said>
    Probably, <persName ref="#cook_0001">Mrs. Cook</persName> was not the less
    loud in her exclamations against the ingratitude
    of the <name>Eboes</name>, from her own loyalty having lately
    been questioned. She had found fault one day 
    in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> with <rs type="persGroup">some women</rs> who feigned  sickness
    in order to remain idle. <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">You no work

    vex, him say him go to <placeName>Kingston</placeName> to-morrow, and
    him wish him neber come back again</distinct>!</said>—<said rend="quotes">What!</said>
    cried <persName ref="#philippa_0001">Philippa</persName>, the mad woman, <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">you wish massa
    neber come back from <placeName>Kingston</placeName></distinct>?</said> So she gave
    <persName ref="#cook_0001">Mrs. Cook</persName> a box on the ear with all her might;
    upon which <persName ref="#cook_0001">Mrs. Cook</persName> snatched up a stick and 
    <pb n="199"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">191</fw>
    broke the mad woman's pate with it. But though
    she could beat a hole in her head, she never could
    beat out of it her having said that she wished
    <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct> might never come back. And although
    <persName ref="#philippa_0001">Philippa</persName> has recovered her senses, in her belief
    of <persName ref="#cook_0001">Mrs. Cook's</persName> disloyalty she continues firm; and
    they never meet without renewing the dispute. 
 </p>
 <p>Today being a play-day, the gaiety of the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> 
    was promoted by a distribution of an additional
    quantity of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt-fish</ecda:food> (which forms a most acceptable
    ingredient in their <ecda:food>pepper-pots</ecda:food>), and as much <ecda:food>rum</ecda:food>
    and <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food> as they chose to drink. But there was 
    also a dinner prepared at the house where the
    <distinct rend="quotes" type="ethnographic">white people</distinct> reside, expressly for none but the
    <distinct type="ethnographic" rend="italic">pickaninny-mothers</distinct>; that is, for the women who
    had children living. I had taken care, when this
    play-day was announced by the <ecda:anonPers>head driver</ecda:anonPers>, to
    make him inform the negroes that they were indebted 
    for it entirely to these mothers; and to
    show them more respect, I went to them after
    dinner myself, and drank their healths. The most
    respectable blacks on the estate were also assembled
    in the room; and I told them that <seg ana="#textile">clothes</seg>
    would wear out, and <seg ana="#currency">money</seg> would be spent,
    and that I wished to give them something more
    lasting than <seg ana="#textile">clothes</seg> or <seg ana="#currency">money</seg>. The law only allows
    them, as a matter of right, every alternate Saturday
    for themselves, and holidays for three days at
    <name>Christmas</name>, which, with all Sundays, forms their
    whole legal time of relaxation. I therefore granted
    <pb n="200"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">192</fw>
    them as a matter of right, and of which no person
    should deprive them on any account whatever,
    <emph rend="italic">every</emph> Saturday to cultivate <rs type="place">their grounds</rs>; and in
    addition to their holidays at <name>Christmas</name>, I gave
    them for play-days <name>Good-Friday</name>, the second Friday
    in October, and the second Friday in July. By
    which means, they will in future have the same
    number of holidays four times a year, which hitherto
    they have been allowed only once, <mcr rend="italic">i.e.</mcr> at <name>Christmas</name>.
    The first is to be called <name rend="quotes">the royal play-day</name>,
    in honour of that excellent Princess, the <persName ref="#frederica_charlotte_1767">Duchess 
    of <placeName>York</placeName></persName>; and the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are directed to give three
    cheers upon the <ecda:anonPers>head driver's</ecda:anonPers> announcing <said rend="quotes">The
    health of our good lady, H.R.H the <persName ref="#frederica_charlotte_1767">Duchess 
    of <placeName>York</placeName></persName></said> And I told them, that before my
    leaving the island, I should hear them drink this 
    health, and should not fail to let Her Royal Highness 
    know, that the <rs type="persGroup">negroes of <placeName>Cornwall</placeName></rs> drank her
    health every year. This evidently touched the
    right chord of their vanity, and they all bowed
    and courtesied down to the very ground, and said,
    that would do them much high honour. The
    ninth being my own birthday, the July play-day
    is to be called <name rend="quotes">the <distinct type="dialect">massa's</distinct></name>; and that in October
    is to be in honour of the <distinct type="ethnographic">piccaninny-mothers</distinct>, from
    whom it is to take its name.     
 </p>
 <p>The poor creatures overflowed with gratitude;
    and the prospective indulgences which had just
    been announced, gave them such an increase of
    spirits, that on returning to my own residence, they
    <pb n="201"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">193</fw>
    fell to singing and dancing again with as much 
    violence as if they had been a pack of <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> furies
    at the Opera. The favorite song of the night was,
    <quote rend="quotes"><distinct>Since massa come, we very well off</distinct>;</quote>
    which words they repeated in chorus, without
    intermission (dancing all the time), for hours together;
    till, at half-past three, neither my eyes nor
    my brain could endure it any longer, and I was 
    obliged to send them word that I wanted to go to
    bed, and could not sleep till the noise should cease. 
    The idea of my going to bed seemed never to have
    occurred to them till that moment. Fortunately,
    like <persName ref="#samuel_johnson_1709">Johnson's</persName> definition of wit, <quote rend="quotes" source="johnson_lives">the idea, although
    novel, was immediately acknowledged to be just</quote>.
    So instantly the drums and <distinct type="dialect">gumbies</distinct> left off beating;
    the <rs type="persGroup">children</rs> left off singing; the <rs type="persGroup">women and
    men</rs> left off dancing; and they all with one accord
    fell to kicking, and pulling, and thumping about
    two dozen of their companions, who were lying
    fast asleep upon the floor. Some were roused,
    some resisted, some began fighting, some got up
    and lay down again; but at length, by dint of
    their leading some, carrying others, and rolling
    the remainder down the steps, I got my house
    clear of <rs type="persGroup">my black guests</rs> about four in the morning.
    Another of their popular songs this evening 
    was—
    <quote rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">All the stories them telling you are lies, oh</distinct>!</quote>
    <pb n="202"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">194</fw>
    which is meant as a satire upon the <name>Eboes</name>. My 
    friend <persName ref="#strap_0001">Strap</persName> being an Eboe, and one who had
    hitherto generally taken a leading part in all the
    discontents and squabbles of his countrymen, I
    was not without apprehension of his having been
    concerned in the late complaint. I was, therefore,
    much pleased to find that he had positively refused
    to take any share in the business, and had
    been to the full as violent as any of the <name>Creoles</name>
    in reprobating the ingratitude of the <name>Eboes</name>. Today
    he came up to the house dressed in his best
    clothes, to show me his <rs type="persGroup">seven children</rs>; and he
    marched at their head in all the dignity of paternal
    pride. He begged me particularly to notice
    <rs type="persGroup">two fine little girls</rs>, who were twins. I told him
    that I had seen them already. <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Iss! iss</distinct>!</said> he said;
    <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">massa see um; but massa no <emph rend="italic">admire</emph> um enough
    yet</distinct>.</said> Upon which I fell to admiring them, tooth 
    and nail, and the father went away quite proud 
    and satisfied.

  <p>Yesterday it was observed at <placeName>George's Plain</placeName>, an
     estate about four miles off, that the water-mill did
     not work properly, and it was concluded that the
     grating was clogged up with rubbish. To clear it
     away, <ecda:anonPers>a negro</ecda:anonPers> immediately jumped down into the
     trench upon a log of wood; when he felt the log
     move under him, and of course jumped out again
     with all possible expedition. It was then dis-
     <pb n="203"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">195</fw>
     covered that the impediment in question proceeded
     from a large <ecda:fauna>alligator</ecda:fauna> which had wandered from
     the morass, and, in the hope of finding his way to
     the river, and swam up the mill-trench till he
     found himself stopped by the grating; and the 
     banks being too high for him to gain them by
     leaping upwards, and the place of his confinement
     too narrow to admit of his turning round to go
     back again, his escape was impossible, and a ball,
     lodged near his eye, soon put an end to him. I
     went over to see him this morning; but I was not
     contented with merely seeing him, so I begged to
     have a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">steak</ecda:food> cut off for me, brought it home, and
     ordered it to be broiled for dinner. <ecda:anonPers>One of the 
     negroes</ecda:anonPers> happened to see it in the kitchen; the
     news spread through the estate like wildfire; and
     I had immediately half a dozen different deputations,
     all hoping that <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct> would not think of
     eating the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">alligator</ecda:food>, for it was poisonous. However,
     I was obstinate, and found the taste of the flesh,
     when broiled with <ecda:food>pepper and salt</ecda:food>, and assisted by
     an <ecda:food ana="#fauna">onion sauce</ecda:food>, by no means to be despised; but
     the consistence of the meat was disagreeable, being
     as tough as a piece of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">eel-skin</ecda:food>. Perhaps any body
     who wishes to eat alligator stakes in perfection,
     ought to keep them for two or three days before
     dressing them; or the animal's age might be in fault,
     for the fellow was so old that he had scarcely a tooth
     in his head; I therefore contented myself with two
     or three morsels; but <ecda:anonPers>a person</ecda:anonPers> who was dining
     <pb n="204"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">196</fw>
     with me ate a whole <ecda:food ana="#fauna">steak</ecda:food>, and pronounced the
     dish to be a very good one. The <ecda:food>eggs</ecda:food> are said to
     be very palatable; nor have the negroes who live
     near morasses, the same objection with those of
     <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> to eating the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">flesh</ecda:food>; it is, however, true
     that the gall of the <ecda:fauna ana="#food">alligator</ecda:fauna>, if not extracted 
     fully, will render the whole animal unfit for food;
     and <seg ana="#poison">when this gall is reduced to powder, it forms a
     poison of the most dangerous nature, as the negroes
     know but too well.</seg>

     I had given the most positive orders that no
     person whatever should presume to strike a negro,
     or give him abusive language, or, however great
     the offence might be, should inflict any punishment,
     except by the sole direction of the <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers> himself.
     Yet, although I had already discharged one <ecda:anonPers>book-
     keeper</ecda:anonPers> on this account, this evening another of 
     them had a dispute in the <rs type="place">boiling-house</rs> with an
     <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> named <persName ref="#frank_0001">Frank</persName>, because a pool of water was
     not removed fast enough; upon which he called him
     a rascal, sluiced him with the dirty water, and
     finally knocked him down with the broom. The
     <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> came to me instantly; <rs type="persGroup">four eye-witnesses</rs>,
     who were examined separately, proved the truth of
     his ill-usage; and I immediately discharged the
     book-keeper, who had contented himself with
     simply denying the blow having been given by 
     him: but I told him that I could not possibly allow
     <pb n="205"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">197</fw>
     his single unsupported denial to outweigh five concordant
     witnesses to the assertion; and that, if he
     grounded his claim to being believed merely upon
     his having a white skin, he would find that, on
     <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> estate at least, that claim would not be 
     admitted. The fact was established as evident as
     the sun; and nothing should induce me to retain
     him on my property, except his finding some means
     of appeasing the injured negro, and prevailing on
     him to intercede in his behalf. This was an humiliation
     to which he could not bring himself to
     stoop; and, accordingly, the man has left the
     estate. Probably, indeed, the attempt at reconciliation
     would have been unsuccessful; for when one
     of his companions asked <persName ref="#frank_0001">Frank</persName> whether, if <persName ref="#barker_0001">Mr.

     Me no beg for <persName ref="#barker_0001">Mr. Barker</persName>! him go away</distinct>!</said>—I
     was kept awake for the greatest part of the night by
     the songs and rejoicings of the negroes, at their

  <p>Hearing that a <ecda:fauna>manati</ecda:fauna> (the <ecda:fauna>sea-cow</ecda:fauna>) had been
     taken at the mouth of the <geogName>Cabrita River</geogName>, and was
     kept alive at <placeName>Hope Wharf</placeName>, I got a sailing-

     It was suffered to live in the sea, a rope being
     fastened round it, by which it could be landed at

     not exceeding <measure>nine feet</measure> in length, whereas they

      beg that, when I should leave <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I would 
      direct the boy to be made a tradesman, instead of
      being sent back to be a common field-negro; but
      my own shops are not only full at present, but 
      <pb n="208"/>
      <fw type="pageNum">200</fw>
      loaded with future engagements. <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Sully</persName> then requested
      that I would send his son to learn some
      other trade (a tailor's, for instance) at <placeName>Savannah la
      Mar</placeName>, as had frequently been done in former times;
      but this, also, I was obliged to refuse. I told him,
      that formerly a master could pay for the apprenticeship
      of a clever negro boy, and, instead of employing 
      him afterwards on the estate, could content
      himself with being repaid a share of the profits; 
      but that, since <name>The Abolition</name> had made it impossible
      for the proprietor of an estate to supply the place
      of one negro by the purchase of another, it would 
      be unjust to his companions to suffer any one in
      particular to be withdrawn from service; as in that
      case two hundred and ninety-nine would have to
      do the work, which was now performed by three
      hundred; and, therefore, I could allow <rs type="persGroup">my negroes</rs>
      to apply themselves to no trades but such as related
      to tbe business of the property, such as carpenters,

      which would be extremely to his taste. We finally
      settled, that when the plough should be introduced 
      on <rs type="place">my estate</rs> (which I am very anxious to accomplish,
      and substitute the labour of oxen for that of
      negroes, wherever it can possibly be done), <persName ref="#prince_0001">Prince</persName>
      should be instructed in farming business, and in

    <p>Just now <persName ref="#prince_0001">Prince</persName> came to me with a request of

       that, as I was going away too soon to admit of my

 <p>Since my arrival in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I am not conscous
    of having omitted any means of satisfying <rs type="persGroup">my
    negroes</rs>, and rendering them happy and secure
    from oppression. I have suffered no person to be
    punished, except the <rs type="persGroup">two female demons</rs> who 
    almost bit a <rs type="person" ref="#jenny_0001">girl's</rs> hands off (for which they received
    a slight switching), and the most worthless 
    <ecda:anonPers>rascal</ecda:anonPers> on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, who for manifold offences I
    was compelled, for the sake of discipline, to allow
    to pass two days in the bilboes. I have never refused 
    a favour that I could possibly grant. I have
    listened patiently to all complaints. I have increased
    the number of negro holidays, and have
    given away <seg ana="#currency">money</seg> and presents of all kinds incessantly. 
    Now for my reward. On Saturday morning
    there were no fewer than <rs type="persGroup">forty-five persons</rs> (not
    including children) in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>; which makes
    <pb n="212"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">204</fw>
    nearly a fifth of <rs type="persGroup">my whole gang</rs>. Of these, the
    medical people assured me that not above <rs type="persGroup">seven</rs> had
    any thing whatever the matter with them; the rest
    were only feigning sickness out of mere idleness, and
    in order to sit doing nothing, while their companions
    were forced to perform their part of th estate-
    duty. And sure enough, on Sunday morning they 
    all walked away from the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> to amuse themselves,
    except about seven or eight: they will, 
    perhaps, go to the field for a couple of days; and
    on Wednesday we may expect to have them all
    back again, complaining of pains, which (not 
    existing) it is not possible to remove. <persName ref="#jenny_0001">Jenny</persName> (the
    girl whose hands were bitten) was told by the
     <ecda:anonPers>doctoress</ecda:anonPers>, that having been in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> all the
    week, she ought not, for very shame, to go out
    on Sunday. She answered <said rend="quotes" direct="false">She wanted to go to

    well, she had tied packthread round them so as to
    cut deep into the flesh, had rubbed dirt into them,
    and, in short, had played such tricks as nearly to
    produce a mortification in one of her fingers.     
 </p>
 <p>The most worthless fellow on the whole property
    is one <persName ref="#nato_0001">Nato</persName>,—a thief, a liar, a runaway, and one
    who has never been two days together out of the

    the matter with him; indeed, when the <rs type="persGroup">other
    negroes</rs> abused him for his laziness, and leaving
    them to do his work for him, he told them plainly
    that he did not mean to work, and that nobody
    should make him. The only real illness which
    brought him to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, within my knowledge,
    was the consequence of a beating received from
    <ecda:anonPers>his own father</ecda:anonPers>, who had caught him in the act of 
    robbing his house by the help of a false key. In 
    the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> he found his wife, <persName ref="#philippa_0001">Philippa</persName>, the mad
    woman, with whom he instantly quarrelled, and
    she cut his head open with a plate; and as she
    might have served one of the children in the same
    way, we were obliged to confine her. Her husband
    was thought to be the fittest person to guard 
    her; and accordingly they were locked up together
    in a separate room from the <rs type="persGroup">other invalids</rs>, till a
    straight waistcoat could be made. The husband was
    then restored to freedom, and desired to go to work,
    which he declared to be impossible from illness; yet
    he disappeared the whole of the next day; and on his
    return on the following morning, he had the impudence
    to assert that he had never been out of the
    <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> for an hour. For this runaway offence, and
    for endeavouring to exasperate his wife's phrensy,
    he was put in the bilboes for two days: on
    the third he was released; when he came to me
    with tears in his eyes, impored me most earnestly
    to forgive what had past, and promised to behave

    them, although neither he nor his wife had committed a

    when, in fact, she was perfectly in her senses.</said>
    Unluckily, <ecda:anonPers>one of my physicians</ecda:anonPers> had told <persName ref="#williams_0001">Mr.
    Williams</persName>, that very morning, how much he had
    been alarmed at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, when, upon going into
    a mad woman's room, her husband had fastened
    the door, and he had found himself shut up between
    them; the woman really mad, and the 
    man pretending to be so to too. The moment that
    <persName ref="#nato_0001">Nato</persName> mentioned the mad woman as his wife,
    <said rend="quotes">What then,</said> said <persName ref="#williams_0001">Mr. Williams</persName>, <said rend="quotes">you are the

    On which he was ordered to get out of <persName ref="#williams_0001">Mr.

    <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, and in a few days came to me with such

    that he induced me to forgive him. 
 </p>
 <p>To sum up the whole, about three this morning
    an alarm was tiven that the <ecda:anonPers>pen-keeper</ecda:anonPers> had suffered
    the <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> to get among the <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">canes</ecda:flora>, where they might

    <fw type="pageNum">207</fw>
    do infinite mischief; the <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers> was roused out of
    his bed; the <rs type="persGroup">drivers</rs> blew their shells to summon
    the <rs>negroes</rs> to their assistance; when it appeared,
    that there was not a single watchman at his post;
    the watch-fires had all been suffered to expire;
    not a single domestic was to be found, nor a <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>
    to be procured; even the <rs type="persGroup">little servant boys</rs>, whom
    the <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers> had locked up in his own house, and
    had left fast asleep when he went to bed, had got
    up again, and made their escape to pass the night
    in play and rioting; and although they were perfectly 
    aware of the detriment which the <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> 
    were doing to my interests, not a negro could be
    prevailed upon to rouse himself and help to drive
    them out, till at length <persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina</persName> (who had run

    And so much for negro gratitude! However,

    from <ecda:flora ana="#medical">simples</ecda:flora> of the island, which moderate its
    virulence for a time; but the disease itself is
    never entirely subdued. On the contrary, <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes">the
    yaws</distinct>, although it defies the power of medicine,
    ultimately cures itself. This, also, is communicated
    by contact, and that of so slight a nature,
    that a <ecda:fauna>fly</ecda:fauna>, which had touched an ulcer produced
    by <distinct type="dialect">the yaws</distinct>, has been known to convey
    the infection by merely alighting on the wound of
    a cut finger. It generally shows itself by a slight
    pimple, which is soon converted into a sore; and
    this spreads itself gradually over the invalid's
    whole body, till having made its progress through
    the system completely, its virulence gradually
    abates, and at length the disease disappears all
    together. As <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes">the yaws</distinct> can only be taken
    once, innoculation has been tried upon the most
    hopeful subjects; but the disease showed itself
    with as much violence as when contracted in the
    natural way.

  <p>The <ecda:flora ana="#food">shaddock</ecda:flora> contains generally thirty-two
     seeds, two of which only will reproduce <ecda:flora ana="#food">shaddocks</ecda:flora>;
     and these two it is impossible to distinguish:
     the rest will yield, some <ecda:flora ana="#food">sweet oranges</ecda:flora>,
     <pb n="220"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">212</fw>
     others <ecda:flora ana="#food">bitter ones</ecda:flora>, others again <ecda:flora ana="#food">forbidden fruit</ecda:flora>, and
     in short, all the varieties of the <ecda:flora ana="#food">orange</ecda:flora>; but until
     the trees are are actually in bearing, no one can guess
     what the fruit is likely to prove; and even then,
     the seeds which produce <ecda:flora ana="#food">shaddocks</ecda:flora>, although
     taken from a tree remarkable for the excellence of
     its fruit, will frequently yield only such as are
     scarcely eatable. So also the varieties of the <ecda:flora ana="#food">mango</ecda:flora>
     are infinite: the fruit of no two trees resembling 
     each other; and the seeds of the very finest <ecda:flora ana="#food">mango</ecda:flora>
     (although sown and cultivated with the utmost
     care) seldom affording any thing at all like the
     parent stock. The two first <ecda:food ana="#flora">mangoes</ecda:food> which I tasted
     were nothing but turpentine and <ecda:food>sugar</ecda:food>; the third
     was very delicious; and yet I was told that it was 
     by no means of a superior quality. The <ecda:food ana="#flora"><distinct rend="italic" type="agricultural">sweet</distinct> 
     cassava</ecda:food> requires no preparation; the <ecda:flora ana="#food"><distinct type="agricultural" rend="italic">bitter</distinct> cassava</ecda:flora>,
     unless the <ecda:food>juice</ecda:food> is carefully pressed out of it, is a
     deadly poison; there is a third kind, called the <ecda:flora ana="#food"><distinct rend="italic" type="agricultural">sweet-
     and-bitter</distinct> cassava</ecda:flora>, which is perfectly wholesome
     till a certain age, when it acquires its deleterious
     qualities. Many persons have been poisoned by
     mistaking these various kinds of <ecda:flora ana="#food">cassava</ecda:flora> for each
     other. As soon as the <ecda:flora ana="#food">plantain</ecda:flora> has done bearing,
     it is cut down; when four or five suckers spring
     from each root, which become <ecda:flora ana="#food">plants</ecda:flora> themselves in
     their turn. <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">Ratoons</ecda:flora> are suckers of the <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">sugar-cane</ecda:flora>:
     they are far preferable to the original <ecda:flora ana="#cultivation #commodity">plants</ecda:flora>, where
     the soil is rich enough to support them; but they 
     are much better adapted to some estates than to 
     <pb n="221"/>
     <fw type="pageNum">213</fw>
     others. Thus, on my estate in <placeName>St. Thomas's in the
     East</placeName>, they can allow of ten <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">ratoons</ecda:flora> from the
     same <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">plant</ecda:flora>, and only dig <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #plant">cane</ecda:flora>-holes every eleventh
     year; while, at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, the strength of the <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #plant">cane</ecda:flora>
     is exhausted in the fourth <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">ratoon</ecda:flora>, or the fifth at
     furthest. The fresh <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">plants</ecda:flora> are <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">cane-tops</ecda:flora>; but 
     those <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">canes</ecda:flora> which bear <distinct rend="italic" type="agricultural">flags</distinct> or feathers at their
     extremities will not answer the purpose, as dry
     weather easily burns up the slight arrows to which
     the flags adhere, and destroys them before they
     can acquire sufficient vigour to resist the climate.

<p>I find that I have not done justice to the <ecda:flora>cotton
   tree</ecda:flora>, and, on the other hand, have given too much
   praise to the <rs type="properAdjective">Jamaica</rs> kitchen. The first <ecda:flora>cotton
   trees</ecda:flora> which I saw, were either withered by age, or
   struck by lightning, or happened to be ill-shaped
   of their kind; but I have since met with others,
   than which nothing can be more noble or picturesque,
   from their gigantic height, the immense
   spread of their arms, the colour of their stems and 
   leaves, and the wild fantastic wreathings of their
   roots and branches. As to the kitchen, nothing
   can be larger and finer in appearance than the
   <ecda:food ana="#fauna">poultry</ecda:food> of all kinds, but nothing can be uniformly
   more tough and tasteless; and the same is the case
   with all <ecda:food ana="#fauna">butcher's meat</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#fauna">pork</ecda:food> excepted, which is
   much better here than in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. The fault is in
   the climate, which prevents any <ecda:food ana="#fauna">animal food</ecda:food> from
   <pb n="222"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">214</fw>
   being kept sufficiently long to become tender; so
   that when a man sits down to a <rs type="properAdjective">Jamaica</rs> <ecda:food>dinner</ecda:food>, he
   might almost fancy himself a guest at <persName ref="macbeth_0001">Macbeth's</persName>
   <rs type="properAdjective">Covent-Garden</rs> baquet, where the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">fowls</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#fauna">hams</ecda:food>,
   and <ecda:food ana="#fauna">legs of mutton</ecda:food> are all made of deal boards. I
   ordered a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">duck</ecda:food> to be kept for two days; but it was
   so completely spoiled, that there was no bearing it 
   upon the table. Then I tried the expidient of 
   boiling a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">fowl</ecda:food> til it absolutely fell to pieces; but
   even this violent process had not the power of 
   rendering it tender. The only effect produced by
   it was, that instead of being helped to a wing of
   solid wood, I got a plateful of splinters. Perhaps, 
   my having totally lost my appetite (probably from
   my not being able to take, in this climate, sufficient
   of my usual exercise) makes the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">meat</ecda:food> appear to me
   less palatable than it may to others; but I have
   observed, that most people here prefer living upon
   <ecda:food>soups</ecda:food>, <ecda:food>stews</ecda:food>, and <ecda:food>salted provisions</ecda:food>. For my own
   part, I have for the last few weeks eaten nothing
   except <ecda:food ana="#fauna">black crabs</ecda:food>, than which I never met with a
   more delicous article for the table. I have also 
   tried the <ecda:food rend="italic" ana="#fauna"><mcr>soldier</mcr> soup</ecda:food>, which is in great estimation
   in <rs type="place">this island</rs>; but although it greatly resembled
   the very richest <ecda:food ana="#fauna">cray-fish soup</ecda:food>, it seemed to be
   composed of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">cray-fish</ecda:food> which had been kept too
   long. The <ecda:fauna ana="#food" rend="italic">soldiers</ecda:fauna> themselves were perfectly fresh,
   for they were brought to the kitchen quite alive
   and merry; but I was told that this taste of 
   staleness is their peculiar flavour, as well as their 
   <pb n="223"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">215</fw>
   peculiar scent even when alive, and is precisely
   the quality which forms their recommendation. It
   was quite enough to fix my opinion of the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">soup</ecda:food>:
   I ate two spoonfuls, and never mean to venture on
   a third.

 <p>The most general of negro infirmities appears to
    be that of lameness. It is chiefly occasioned by
    the <distinct type="scientific" rend="italic"><ecda:fauna>chiga</ecda:fauna></distinct>, a <ecda:fauna>diminutive fly</ecda:fauna> which works itself into
    the feet to lay its eggs, and, if it be not carefully
    extracted in time, the flesh around it corrupts, and
    a sore ensues not easily to be cured. No vigilance
    can prevent the attacks of the <ecda:fauna>chiga</ecda:fauna>; and not only
    soldiers, but the very cleanest persons of the highest
    rank in society, are obliged to have their feet examined
    regularly. The negroes are all provided
    with small knives for the purpose of extracting
    them: but as no pain is felt till the sore is produced, 
    their extreme laziness frequently makes
    them neglect that precaution, till all kinds of dirt
    getting into the wound, increases the difficulty of
    a cure; and sometimes the consequence is lameness
    for life. 
 </p>
 <p>There is another disease which commits great
    ragages among them; for although in this climate
    its quality is far from virulent, and it is easy to be
    cured in its beginning, the negro will most carefully 
    conceal his having such a complaint, till it
    has made so great a progress that its effects are 
    <pb n="224"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">216</fw>
    perceived by others. Even then, they will never
    acknowledge the way in which they have contracted 
    it; but men and women, whose noses 
    almost shake while speaking to you, will still insist
    upon it that their illness arises from catching a cold,
    or from a strain in lifting a weight, or, in short,
    from any cause except the true one. Yet why
    they act thus it is difficult to imagine; for certainly
    it does not arise from shame.  
 </p>   
 <p>Indeed, it is one of their singular obstinacies,
    that, however ill they may be, they scarcely ever
    will confess to the physician what is really the
    matter with them on their first coming into the
    <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, but will rather assign some other cause
    for their being unwell than the true one; and it is
    only by cross-questioning, that their superintendents
    are able to understand the true nature of their
    case. Perhaps this duplicity is occasioned by
    fear; for in any bodily pain it is not possible to be
    more cowardly than the negro; and I have heard
    strong young men, while the tears were running
    down their cheeks, scream and roar as if a limb
    was amputating, although the <ecda:anonPers>doctoress</ecda:anonPers> was only 
    applying a poultice to a whitlow on the finger. I
    suppose, therefore, that dread of the pain of some
    unknown mode of treatment makes them conceal
    their real disease, and name some other, of which
    they know the cure to be unattended with bodily
    suffering or long restraint. In the disease I allude
    to, such a motive would operate with peculiar 
    <pb n="225"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">217</fw>
    force, as one of their chief aversions is the necessarily
    being long confined to one certainly not
    fragrant room.

 <p>The Reporter of the <orgName><rs type="properAdjective">West African</rs> Institution</orgName> asserts,
    in a late pamphlet, that in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> the
    breeding system is to this day discouraged, and
    that the planters are still indifferent to the preservation
    of their present stock of negroes, from their
    confidence of getting fresh supplies from <placeName>Africa</placeName>. 
    Certainly the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> are by no means
    of this Reporter's opinion, but are thoroughly
    sensible of their intrinsic value in the eyes of the
    proprietor. On my arrival, every woman who had 
    a child held it up to show to me, exclaiming,—
    <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">See massa, see! here nice new neger me bring for
    work for massa</distinct>;</said> and those who had more than
    one did not fail to boast of the number, wnd make
    it a claim to the greater merit with me. Lst 
    wee, an old watchman was brought home from 
    the <rs type="place">mountains</rs> almost dead with fever; he would
    neither move, nor speak, nor notice any one,
    for several days. For two nights I sent him
    <ecda:food>soup</ecda:food> from my own table; but he could not even
    taste it, and always gave it to his <ecda:anonPers>daughter</ecda:anonPers>. On
    the third evening, there happened to be no <ecda:food>soup</ecda:food> at
    dinner, and I sent other food instead; but old 
    <persName ref="#cudjoe_0001">Cudjoe</persName> had been accustomed to see the <ecda:food>soup</ecda:food> arrive,
    and the disappointment made him fancy himself
    hungry, and that he could have eaten the soup if 
    <pb n="226"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">218</fw> 
    it had been brought as usual: accordingly, when I
    visited him the next morning, he bade the <ecda:anonPers>doctoress</ecda:anonPers>
    tell me that <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct> had sent him no <ecda:food>soup</ecda:food> the
    night before. This was the first notice that he
    ahd ever taken of me. I promised that some
    <ecda:food>soup</ecda:food> should be ordered for him on purpose that 
    evening. Could he fancy anything to eat <emph rend="italic">then</emph>?
    <said rend="quotes"><ecda:food>Milk</ecda:food>! <ecda:food>milk</ecda:food>!</said> So <ecda:food>milk</ecda:food> was sent to him, and he
    drank two full calabashes of it. I then tried him
    with an <ecda:food>egg</ecda:food>, which he also got down; and at night,
    by spoonfuls at a time, he finished the whole bason
    of <ecda:food>soup</ecda:food>; but when I next came to see him, and he
    wished to thank me, the words in which he thought 
    he could comprise most gratitude were bidding <ecda:anonPers>the
    doctoress</ecda:anonPers> tell me he would do his best not to die
    yet; he promised to <emph rend="italic">fight hard</emph> for it. He is now
    quite out of danger, and seems really to be grateful. 
    When he was sometimes too weak to speak, on my
    leaving the room he would drage his hand to his 
    mouth with difficulty, and kiss it three or four
    times to bid me farewell; and once, when the <ecda:anonPers>doctoress</ecda:anonPers>
    mentioned his having charged her to tell me
    that he owed his recovery to the good food that I
    had sent him, he added <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">And him kind wors too,

<p>Poor <persName ref="nato_0001">Nato's</persName> stock of goodness is quite exhausted;
   and the day before yesterday he returned to the
   <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> with most piteous complaints of pains and
   aches, whose existence he could persuade no person
   to credit. His pulse was regular, his skin 
   cool, his tongue red and moist, and the <ecda:anonPers>doctor</ecda:anonPers>
   declared nothing whatever to be the matter with
   him. However, on my arrival, he began to moan,
   and groan, and grunt, and all so lamentably, that
   every soul in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, sick or well, burst into
   a fit of laughter. For my part, I told him that I
   really believed him to be very bad; and that, as he 
   met with no sympathy in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, I should
   remove him from such unfeeling companions. Accordingly
   I had a comfortable bed made for him 
   in a separate house. Here he was plentifully supplied
   with provision: but, in order that he might 
   <pb n="228"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">220</fw>
   enjoy perfect repose during his illness, he doors
   were kept locked, and no person allowed to disturb
   him with their conversation; while, by <ecda:anonPers>the
   doctor's</ecda:anonPers> orders, he was obliged to take frequent
   doses of <ecda:flora ana="#medical">Bitter-Wood</ecda:flora> and <ecda:flora ana="#medical">Assafœtida</ecda:flora>. Shame would
   not suffer him to get well all at once; so yesterday
   he still complained of a pain in his chest, and
   begged to be blooded. His request was granted;
   and the blood proved to be so pure and well-
   coloured, that every one exclaimed, that for a man 
   who had such good blood to part with it so wantonly
   was a shame and a folly. The fellow was
   at length convinced that his tricks would serve no
   object; and this morning he begged me to suffer
   him to return to his duty, and promised that I
   should have no more cause to complain of him.
   So I contented to consider his cure as completed,
   and he set off for the field perfectly satisfied with
   his release.

<p>On opening the <orgName>Assize-court</orgName> for the county of
   <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> on <date when="1816-03-04">March 4</date>., <persName ref="#james_stewart_1766">Mr. Stewart</persName>, the Custos of
   <placeName>Trelawny</placeName>, and Presiding Judge, said, in his charge 
   to the <rs type="persGroup">jury</rs>, he wished to direct their attention
   in a peculiar manner to the infringement of slave-
   laws in the <rs type="place">island</rs>, in consequence of charges having
   been brought forward in <placeName>England</placeName> of slave laws not
   being inforced in this country, and being in fact 
   perfect dead letters. The charge was unfounded;
   <pb n="229"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">221</fw>
   but it became proper, in consequence, for the bench
   to call in a strong manner on the <rs type="persGroup">grand jury</rs> to be
   particularly vigilant and attentive to the discharge
   of this part of their duty. The bench at the same
   time adverted to another subject connected with
   the above. Many out of the country, and <emph rend="italic">some in
   it</emph>, had thought proper to interfere with our system,
   and by their insidious practices and dangerous 
   doctrines to call the peace of the island into question,
   and to promoted disorder and confusion. <rs type="persGroup">The
   jury</rs> were therefore enjoined, in every such case,
   to investigate it thoroughly, and to bring the parties 
   concerned before the country, and not to suffer
   the systems of the <rs type="place">island</rs>, as established by the laws
   of the land, to be overset or endangered. It was
   their bounden duty to watch over and support the
   established laws, and to act against those who dared
   to infringe them; and that, otherwise, it was imperiously
   called for on the principle of self-preservation.
   Every country had its peculiar laws, on the 
   due maintenance of which depended the public
   safety and welfare. I read all this with the most 
   perfect unconsciousness; when, lo and behold! I
   have been assured, from a variety of quarters, that
   all this was levelled at myself! It is I (it seems)
   who am <quote rend="quotes">calling the peace of the island in question</quote>;
   who am <quote rend="quotes">promoting disorder and confusion</quote>;
   and who am <quote rend="quotes">infringing the established
   laws!</quote> I should hever have guessed it! By <quote rend="quotes">insidious
   practices</quote> is meant (as I am told) my over-
   <pb n="230"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">222</fw>
   indulgence to my negroes; and my endeavouring
   to obtain either redress or pardon for those belonging
   to other estates, who occasionally appeal to
   me for protection: while <quote rend="quotes">dangerous doctrines</quote>
   alludes to my being of opinion, that the evidence 
   of negroes ought to be at least <emph rend="italic">heard</emph> against white
   persons; the jury always making proportionable
   abatements of belief, from bearing in mind the bad
   habits of most negroes, their general want of probity
   and good faith in every respect, and their
   total ignorance of the nature of religious obligations.
   At the same time, these defects may be
   counterbalanced by the respectable character of the
   particular negro; by the strength of corroborating
   circumstance; and, finally, by the irresistable conviction
   which his evidence may leave upon the 
   minds of the jury. They are not obliged to <emph rend="italic">believe</emph>
   a negro witness, but I maintain that he ought to
   be <emph rend="italic">heard</emph>, and then let the jury give their verdict
   according to their conscience. But this, in the 
   opinion of the bench at <placeName>Montego Bay</placeName>, it seems, is
   <quote rend="quotes">dangerous doctrine!</quote> At least, the venom of my
   doctrines is circumscribed within very narrow
   limits; for as I have made a point of never stirring 
   off my own <rs type="place">estate</rs>, nobody could possibly be corrupted 
   by them, except those who were at the 
   trouble of walking into my house for the express
   purpose of being corrupted. 
</p> 
<p>At all events, if I <emph rend="italic">really</emph> am the person to whom
   <persName ref="#james_steart_1766">Mr. Stewart</persName> alluded, I must consider his speech as
   <pb n="231"/>
   <fw type="pageNum">223</fw>
   the most flattering compliemnt that I ever received.
   If my presence in the <rs type="place">island</rs> has made the bench of
   a whole country think it necessary to exact from the
  <rs type="persGroup">jury</rs> a more severe vigilance than usual in all causes
   relating to the protection of negroes, I cannot but
   own myself most richly rewarded for all my pains
   and expense in coming hither, for every risk of the
   voyage, and for every possible sacrifice of my pleasures.
   There is nothing earthly that is too much 
   to give for the power of producing an effect so
   beneficial; and I would set off for <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>
   to-morrow, could I only be convinced that my
   arrival would make the <name>Mufti</name> redress the complaints
   of the lower orders of <name>Turks</name> with more
   scrupulous justice, and the <name>Bashaws</name> relax the fetters
   of their <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs> as much as their safety would
   permit. But I cannot flatter myself with having
   done either the one or the other in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>; and
   if <persName ref="#james_stewart_1766">Mr. Stewart</persName> <emph rend="italic">really</emph> alluded to me in his charge,
   I am certainly greatly obliged to him; but he has
   paid me much to high a compliment;—<name>God</name> grant
   that I may live to deserve it!

 <p>The <rs type="persGroup">two ringleaders</rs> of the proposed rebellion

    <rs type="persGroup">above two hundred and fifty</rs> had been sworn in

    and a <ecda:anonPers><distinct type="ethnographic" rend="italic">brown</distinct> <name>Anabaptist</name> missionary</ecda:anonPers>, both of whom
    had been very active in promoting the plot. They
    had elected a <ecda:anonPers>King of the <name>Eboes</name></ecda:anonPers>, who had two
    <rs type="persGroup">Captains</rs> under him; and their intention was to
    effect a complete massacre of all the <rs type="persGroup">whites</rs> on
    the <rs type="place">island</rs>; for which laudable design <ecda:anonPers>His Majesty</ecda:anonPers>
    thought <name>Christmas</name> the very fittest season in the

    were for striking the blow immediately. The next
    morning information was given against them: <ecda:anonPers>one
    of the Captains</ecda:anonPers> escaped to the woods; but <ecda:anonPers>the
    other</ecda:anonPers>, and the <ecda:anonPers>King of the <name>Eboes</name></ecda:anonPers>, were seized and

  <p>The <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> certainly are perverse beings. They
     have been praying for a sight of <rs type="person" ref="#matthew_lewis_1775">their master</rs> year
     after year; they were in raptures at my arrival; I
     have suffered no one to be punished, and shown
     them every possible indulgence during my residence
     amongst them; and one and all they declare
     themselves perfectly happy and well treated. Yet,
     previous to my arrival, they made <measure>thirty-three

     their product dwindled to <measure>twenty-three</measure>; during
     this last week they have managed to make but
     <measure>thirteen</measure>: they love me very well, but they love
     themselves a great deal better; and, to do them
     justice, I verily believe that every negro on the
     estate is extremely anxious that all should do their
     full duty, except himself. My censure, although
     accompanied with the certainty of their not being
     punished, is by no means a matter of indifference.
     If I express myself to be displeased, the whole propertly
     is in an uproar; every body is finding fault
     with every body; nobody that does not represent
     the shame of neglecting my work, and the ingratitude
     of vexing me by their ill-conduct; and then

  <p>The <name>Eboe</name> <ecda:anonPers>Captain</ecda:anonPers> has effected his escape by

   <p>This was the day appointed for the first <name rend="quotes">Royal
    play-day</name>, when I bade farewell to <rs type="persGroup">my negroes</rs>.
    I expected to be besieged with petitions and 
    complaints, as they must either make them on
    this occasion or not at all. I was, therefore,
    most agreeably surprised to find, that although
    they had opportunities of addressing me from
    nine in the morning till twelve at night, the only
    favours asked me were by a <ecda:anonPers>poor old man</ecda:anonPers>, who
      wanted an <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">iron cooking pot</ecda:commodity>, and by <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>, who
      begged me to order a <ecda:anonPers>little daughter of his</ecda:anonPers> to 
      be instructed in needle-work: and as to complaints,
      not a murmur of such a thing was heard; 
      they all expressed themselves to be quite satisfied,
      and seemed to think that they could never say
      enough to mark their gratitude for my kindness,
      and their anxiety for my getting safe to <placeName>England</placeName>. 
      We began our festivities by the <ecda:anonPers>head driver's</ecda:anonPers> drinking
      the health of H. R. H. the <persName ref="#frederica_charlotte_1767">Duchess of <placeName>York</placeName></persName>,
      whom the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> cheered with such a shout as
      might ahve <quote rend="quotes" source="milton_paradise">rent hell's concave</quote>.    
 </p>  
 <p>Then we had a christening for such persons as
    had been absent on the former occasion, one of
    whom was <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>, the reputed <seg ana="#obeah"><rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs>-man</seg>. In
    the number was a new-born child, whom we called
    <persName ref="shakespeare_1816">Shakespeare</persName>, and whom <persName ref="#afra_0001">Afra</persName>, the <name>Eboe</name> mother,
    had very earnestly begged me to make a <name>Christian</name>,
    as well as a daughter of hers, about four or five
    <pb n="246"/>
    <fw type="pageNum">238</fw> 
    years old; at the same time that she declined 
    being christened herself! In the same manner,
    <ecda:anonPers><persName ref="#cubina_0001">Cubina's</persName> wife</ecda:anonPers>, although <ecda:anonPers>her father</ecda:anonPers> and husband
    were both baptised on the former occasion, objected
    to going through the ceremony herself; 
    and the reason which she gave was, that <said rend="quotes">she
    did not like being christened while she was with
    child, as she did not know what change it might
    not produce upon hersel and the infant.</said>   
 </p>
  <p>After the christening there was a general distribution 
     of <ecda:food ana="#fauna">salt-fish</ecda:food> by the <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>; and I also gave
     <rs type="persGroup">every man and woman</rs> <measure ana="#currency">half a dollar</measure> each, and <rs type="persGroup">every
     child</rs> a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">maccarony</ecda:commodity> (<measure ana="#currency">fifteen pence</measure>) as a parting present,
     to show them that I parted with them in good 
     humour. While the <seg ana="#currency">money</seg> was distributing, <persName ref="#hill_0002">young

        and when I came down the steps to depart, they
        crowded about me, kissing my feet, and clasping
        my knees, so that it was with difficulty that I could
        get into the carriage. And this was done with 
        <pb n="249"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">241</fw> 
        such marks of truth and feeling, that I cannot
        believe the whole to be mere acting and mummery.
     </p>
     <p>I dined with <persName ref="#allwood__0001">Mr. Allwood</persName> at <placeName>Shaftstone</placeName>, his pen
        near <placeName>Blue-fields</placeName>, and at half past seven found
        myself once more on board the <ecda:shipName><persName ref="#godfrey_webster_1747">Sir Godfrey

     </p>
     <p>To fill up my list of <rs type="properAdjective">Jamaica</rs> delicacies, I must
        not forget to mention, that I did my best to procure
        a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Cane-piece Cat</ecda:food> roasted in the true <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs>
        fashion. The <rs type="persGroup"><rs type="properAdjective">Creole</rs> negroes</rs>, however, greatly
        disapproved of my venturing upon this dish, which
        they positively denied having tasted themselves;
        and when, at length, the <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Cat</ecda:food> was procured, last
        Saturday, instead of plainly boiling it with <ecda:food>negro-
        pepper</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>salt</ecda:food>, they made it into a high seasoned
        <ecda:food ana="#fauna">stew</ecda:food>, which rendered it impossible to judge of its
        real flavour. However, I tasted it, as did also
        several other people, and we were unanimous in
        opinion, that it might have been mistaken for a 
        very good <ecda:food ana="#fauna">game-soup</ecda:food>, and that, when properly
        dressed, a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">Cane-piece Cat</ecda:food> must be excellent food.
     </p>
     <p>One of the best vegetable productions of <rs type="place">the
        island</rs> is estimated to be the <ecda:flora ana="#food">Avogada pear</ecda:flora>, sometimes
        called <distinct type="scientific" rend="quotes"><ecda:flora ana="#food">the vegetable marrow</ecda:flora></distinct>. It was 
        not the proper season for them, and with great
        difficulty I procured a couple, which were said to
        be by no means in a state of perfection. Such as
        they were, I could find no great merit in them; 
        they were to be eaten cold with <ecda:food>pepper</ecda:food> and <ecda:food>salt</ecda:food>, and 
        <pb n="250"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">242</fw>
        seemed to be an insipid kind of <ecda:food ana="#flora">melon</ecda:food>, with no 
        other resemblance to <ecda:food ana="#flora">marrow</ecda:food> than their softness.

     <p>The trade-winds which facilitate the passage to
        <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, effectually prevent the return of vessels
        by the same raod. The common passage is through 
        the <placeName>Gulf of Florida</placeName>, but there is another between
        <placeName>Cuba</placeName> and <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName>, which is at least <measure>1000
        miles</measure> nearer. The first, however, affords almost 
        a certainty of reaching <placeName>Europe</placeName> in a given time;
        while you may keep tacking in the attempt to
        make <distinct type="nautical">the windward passage</distinct> (as it is called) for
        months together. Last night the wind was so
        favourable for this attempt, that the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> determined
        upon risking it. Accordingly he altered
        his course; and had not done so for more than a
        few hours, when the wind changed, and became
        as direct for the <placeName>Gulf</placeName>, as till then it had been
        contrary. The consequence was, that the <placeName>Gulf</placeName>
        passage was fixed once for all, and we are now
        steering towards it with all our might and main.
        Besides the distance saved, there was another reason
        for preferring the windward passage, if it could
        have been effected. The <placeName>Gulf of Florida</placeName> has 
        <pb n="252"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">244</fw>
        for some time past been infested by a pirate called
        <persName ref="#mitchell_0001">Captain Mitchell</persName>, who, by all accounts, seems to be
        of the very worst description. It is not long ago,
        since, in company with another vessel of his own
        stamp, he landed on the small settlement of <placeName>St.
        Andrews</placeName>, plundered it completely, and on his departure
        carried off the governor, whom he kept on
        board for more than fourteen days, and then hung
        him at the yard-arm out of mere wanton devilry;
        and indeed he is said to show no more mercy to
        any of his prisoners than he did to the poor governor.
        His companion has been captured and brought 
        into <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, and the conquering vessel is gone
        in search of <persName ref="#mitchell_0001">Captain Mitchell</persName>. If he does not fall
        in with him, and <emph rend="italic">we</emph> do, I fear that we shall stand
        but with a bad chance; for he has <rs type="persGroup">one hundred men </rs>on
        board according to report, while we have not above
        thirty. However, the <rs ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> has harrangued them,
        represented the necessity of their fighting if attacked,
        as <persName ref="#mitchell_0001">Captain Mitchell</persName> is known to spare no
        one, high or low, and has engaged to give every
        man <measure ana="#currency">five guineas</measure> apiece, if a gun should be fired. 
        The <rs type="persGroup">sailors</rs> promise bravery; whether their promises 
        will prove to be <ecda:food>pie-crust</ecda:food>, we must leave to
        be decided by time and <persName ref="#mitchell_0001">Captain Mitchell</persName>. In the
        mean while, every sail that appears on the horizon
        is concluded to be this terrible pirate, and every
        thing is immediately put in readiness for action.

     <p>At noon this day we found ourselves once more
        sailing on the <geogName>Atlantic</geogName>, and bade farewell to the
        <placeName>Gulf of Florida</placeName> without having heard any news of
        the dreader <persName ref="#mitchell_0001">Commodore Mitchell</persName>. The narrow
        and dangerous part of this <placeName>Gulf</placeName> is about <measure>two hundred
        miles</measure> in length, and <measure>fifty</measure> in breadth, bordered 
        on one side by the coast of <placeName>Florida</placeName>, and on the other,
        first by <placeName>Cuba</placeName>, and then by the <placeName>Bahama Islands</placeName>, of
        which the <geogName>Manilla reef</geogName> forms the extremity, and
        which reef also terminates the <placeName>Gulf</placeName>. But on both
        sides of these <measure>two hundred miles</measure>, at the distance 
        of about <measure>four or five miles</measure> from the main land,
        there extends a reef which renders the navigation 
        extremely dangerous. The reef is broken at intervals
        by large inlets; and the sudden and violent
        squalls of wind to which the <placeName>Gulf</placeName> is subject, so
        frequently drive vessels into these perilous openings,
        that it is worth the while of many of the <rs type="persGroup">poorer inhabitants</rs> of <placeName>Florida</placeName> to establish their
        habitations within the reef, and devote themselves
        and their small vessels entirely to the occupation
        <pb n="254"/>
        <fw type="pageNum">246</fw>
        of assisting vessels in distress. They are known by
        the general name of <distinct type="nautical" rend="quotes">wreckers</distinct>, and are allowed
        a certain salvage upon such ships as they may 
        rescue. As proof of the violence of the gales
        which are occasionally experienced in this <placeName>Gulf</placeName>,
        <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">our captain</rs>, about nine years ago, saw the wind
        suddenly take a vessel (which had unwisely suffered
        her canvas to stand, while the rest of the 
        ships under convoy had taken theirs down,) and
        turn completely over, the sails in the water 
        and the keep uppermost. It happened about four
        o'clock in the afternoon: the <ecda:anonPers>captain</ecda:anonPers> and the <rs type="persGroup">passengers</rs>
        were at dinner in the cabin; but as she went over very leisurely, they and the <rs type="persGroup">crew</rs> had
        time allowed theim to escape out of the windows
        and port-holes, and sustain themselves upon the
        riggint, till boats from the ships near them could
        arrive to take them off. As she filled, she gradually
        sunk, and in a quarter of an hour she had 
        disappeared totally.

     <p>Two or three years ago, <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">our captain</rs>, while his
        vessel was lying in <placeName>Black River Bay</placeName>, for the purpose
        of loading, was informed by <rs type="persGroup">his sailors</rs>, that 
        their <ecda:food ana="#fauna #transport #commodity">beef</ecda:food> and other <ecda:commodity ana="#food #transport">provisions</ecda:commodity> frequently disappeared
        in a very unaccountable manner. However,
        by setting up a strict watch during the night,
        he soon managed to clear up the mystery: and <ecda:anonPers>a
        negro</ecda:anonPers>, who had made his escape from the workhouse,
        and concealed himself on board among the
        <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #transport">bags of cotton</ecda:commodity>, was found to be the thief. He
        was sent back to the workhouse, of which the chain
        was still about his neck. But another negro had
        better luck in a similar attempt on board of a
        different vessel. He contrived to secrete himself
        in the lower part of it, where the <ecda:commodity ana="#food #transport">sugar hogsheads</ecda:commodity>
        are stored, unknown to any one. As soon as the
        cargo was completed, the planks above it were
        caulked down, and raised no more till their ship
        reached <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>; when, to the universal astonishment,
        upon opening the hold, out walked <persName ref="#mungo_0001">Mungo</persName>,
        in a wretched condition to be sure, but still at least

      <p>A whole calendar month has elapsed since our
         quitting <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, during which the wind has been
         favourable for something less than four-and-twenty
         hours; either it has blown precisely from the point
         on which we wanted to sail, or has been so faint,
         that we scarcely made <measure>one knot an hour</measure>. However,
         on Tuesday last, finding ourselves in the latitude 
         of the <quote rend="quotes" source="shakespeare_tempest">still vexed <placeName>Bermoothes</placeName></quote>, by way of
         variety, a sudden squall carried away both our lower
         stunsails in the morning; and at nine in the evening
         there came on a gale of wind truly tremendous.
         The ship pitched and rolled every minute, as if she
         had been on the point of overturning; the <ecda:fauna>hen</ecda:fauna>-
         coops floated about on the deck, and many of the <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #transport">poultry</ecda:fauna>
         were found drowned in them the next morning.
         Just as the last dead-light was putting up, the sea
         embraced the opportunity of the window being
         open, to whip itself through, and half filled the
         after-cabin with water; and in half an hour more
         a mountain of waves broke over the vessel, and
         pouring itself through the sky-light, paid the same
         compliment to the fore-cabin, with which it had
         already honoured the after one. About for in the
         morning the storm abated, and then we relapsed
         into our good old jog-trot pace of a knot an hour.
         Our passengers consist of a <persName ref="#walker_0001">Mrs Walker</persName> with her

               <ecda:food>eggs</ecda:food> under each of the trees near which she
               had seen an <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> that morning. The first 
               <ecda:food>egg</ecda:food> produced a <ecda:commodity ana="#use">water-jug</ecda:commodity> exactly similar to that
               which she had broken; out of the second came a
               whole <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">large sugar estate</ecda:commodity>; and out of the third a
               <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation">splendid equipage</ecda:commodity>, in which she returned to her
               <ecda:anonPers>aunt</ecda:anonPers>, delivered up the <ecda:commodity ana="#use">jug</ecda:commodity>, related that an <ecda:anonPers>old

               her a great lady, and then departed in triumph to
               her <ecda:commodity ana="#use">sugar estate</ecda:commodity>. Stung by envy, the <ecda:anonPers>aunt</ecda:anonPers> lost no
               time in sending her own <ecda:anonPers>daughter</ecda:anonPers> to search for the
               same good fortune which had befallen her <ecda:anonPers>cousin</ecda:anonPers>.
               She found the <ecda:flora>cotton-tree</ecda:flora> and the headless <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers>,
               and had the same question addressed to her;
               but instead of returning the same answer—<said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">What 
               me see</distinct>?</said> said she; <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">me see one <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> without
               him head</distinct>!</said> Now this reply was doubly offensive;
               it was rude, because it reminded the <ecda:anonPers>old lady</ecda:anonPers> of
               what might be considered as a personal
               defect; and <seg ana="#obeah">it was dangerous, as, if such a circumstance

               that the old woman had not only got her head on,
               but had a red docker besides, she could not prevail

               disregarded, although she scrupled not to assure
               her <ecda:anonPers>hostess</ecda:anonPers> that she had suffered <ecda:fauna>puss</ecda:fauna> to eat till she
               could eat no more. The <ecda:anonPers>old lady</ecda:anonPers> in the <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #use">red petticoat</ecda:commodity>
               seemed to swallow the lie very glibly, and
               despatched the <ecda:anonPers>girl</ecda:anonPers> to the <ecda:fauna>fowl</ecda:fauna>-house for three
               <ecda:food>eggs</ecda:food>, as she had done before for her <ecda:anonPers>cousin</ecda:anonPers>; but having
               been cautioned against taking the <ecda:food>talking-eggs</ecda:food>,
               she conceived that these must needs be the most
               valuable; and, therefore, made a point of selecting
               those three which seemed to be the greatest gossips
               <pb/>     
     <fw type="pageNum">259</fw>     
               of the whole <ecda:fauna>poultry</ecda:fauna>-yard. Then, lest their chattering
               should betray her disobedience, she thought
               it best not to return into the hut, and, accordingly,
               set forward on her return home; but she had not
               yet reached the <ecda:flora>mahogany tree</ecda:flora>, when curiosity induced
               her to break one of the <ecda:food>eggs</ecda:food>. To her 
               infinite disappointment it proved to be empty;
               and she soon found cause to wish that the second
               had been empty too; for on her dashing it against the 
               the ground, out came an enormous <ecda:fauna>yellow snake</ecda:fauna>,
               which flew at her with dreadful hissings. Away
               ran the <ecda:anonPers>girl</ecda:anonPers>; a fallen <ecda:flora>bamboo</ecda:flora> lay in her path; she
               stumbled over it, and fell. In her fall the third
               <ecda:food>egg</ecda:food> was broken; and the <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> without the
               hed immediately popping out of it, told her, that if
               she had treated her as civilly, and had adhered as
               closely to the truth as her <ecda:anonPers>cousin</ecda:anonPers> had done, she
               would have obtained the same good fortune; but
               that as she had shown her nothing but rudeness, and
               told her nothing but lies, she must be contented to
               carry home nothing but the empty <ecda:food>egg</ecda:food>-shells. The
               <ecda:anonPers>old woman</ecda:anonPers> then jumped upon the <ecda:fauna>yellow snake</ecda:fauna>,
               galloped away with incredible speed, and never
               showed her <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #use">red docker</ecda:commodity> in that part of the island

      <p>During the early part of my outward-bound 
         voyage I was extremely afflicted with sea-sickness;
         and between eight o'clock on a Monday morning,
         and twelve on the following Thursday, I actually
         brought up almost a thousand lines, with rhymes at
         the end of them. Having nothing better to do at
         present, I may as well copy them into this book. 
         Composed with such speed, and under such circumstances,
         I take it for granted that the verses
         cannot be very good; but let them be ever so bad,
         I defy any one to be more sick while reading them
         than the <rs type="person" ref="#matthew_lewis_1775">author himself</rs> was while writing them.
         This strange story was found by me in an old
         <rs type="properAdjective">Italian</rs> book, called <title rend="quotes" xml:lang="it" ref="#cigogna_palagio">Il Palagio degli Incanti</title>, in
         which it was related as a fact, and stated to be
         taken from the <title rend="quotes">Annals of <placeName>Portugal</placeName></title>, an historical
         work. I will not vouch for the truth of it myself;
         and, at all events, I earnestly request that no person
         who may read these verses will ask me <said rend="quotes" direct="false">who the
         hero really was?</said> If he does, I shall only return
         the same answer which the <ecda:anonPers>lady</ecda:anonPers> gave her <ecda:anonPers>husband</ecda:anonPers>
         when, being on the point of shipwreck, he requested 
         her to tell him whether she had really ever
         wronged his bed? <said rend="quotes">My dear,</said> said she, <said rend="quotes">sink or
         swim, that secret shall go to the grave with me.</said>

            <l>Scarce moved the zephyr's wings, while breathed the song,</l>
            <l>And waves in silence moved the bark along.</l>
            <l>'Twas <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza</persName> sang! <persName ref="#rosalvo_0001">Rosalvo</persName> at her side</l>
            <l>Gazed in his cherub-love, his destined bride,</l>
            <l>Felt at each look his soul in softness melt,</l>
            <l>Nor wished to feel more bliss than then he felt</l>
      <pb/>
      <fw type="pageNum">264</fw>         
            <l>Gainst the high mast, intent on book and beads,</l>
            <l>A reverend <ecda:anonPers>abbot</ecda:anonPers> leans, and prays, and reads:</l>
            <l>Marks how <emph rend="italic">she</emph> looks, and listens what <emph rend="italic">he</emph> says.</l>
            <l>An idle task! The terms which speak their love</l>
            <l>Had served for prayer, and passed unblamed above.</l>
            <l>He finds each tender phrase so free from harm,</l>
            <l>So pure each thought, each look so chaste though warm,</l>  
            <l>Still to his book and beads he turns again,</l>
            <l>Pleased to have found his guardian care so vain;</l>
            <l>While oft a blush of shame his pale cheek wears</l>
            <l>To find his thoughts so much less pure than theirs.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Oh! they <emph rend="italic">were</emph> pure! pure as the moon, whose ray</l>
            <l>Loves on the shrines of virgin-saints to play;</l>
            <l>Pure as the falling snow, ere yet its shower</l>
            <l>Bends with its weight its own pale fragile flower.</l>
            <l>Not fourteen years were <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza's</persName>; nay, 'tis true,</l>
            <l>Most maids at twelve know more than <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza</persName> knew:</l>
            <l>And scarce two more had spread with silken down</l>
            <l>Her youthful <rs ref="#rosalvo_0001" type="person">cousin's</rs> cheek of glowing brown.</l>
            <l>His <ecda:anonPers>tutor sage</ecda:anonPers> (in fact, not show, a saint)</l>
            <l>Had kept his heart and mind secure from taint.</l>
            <l>In liberal arts, in healthful manly sports,</l>
            <l>In studies fit for councils, camps, and courts,</l>
            <l>His moments found their full and best employ,</l>  
            <l>Nor left one leisure hour for guilty joy.</l>
            <l>Since her blue <ecda:fauna>dove</ecda:fauna>-like eyes six springs had seen,</l>
            <l>Immured in cloistered shades had <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza</persName> been,</l>
            <l>From duties done her soul delight deriven,</l>
            <l>And her sole care to please the queen of heaven.</l>
            <l>None e'er approached her, save the pure and good:</l>
            <l>Her promised spouse; that <ecda:anonPers>monk</ecda:anonPers> who near them stood;</l>
            <l>Her <ecda:anonPers>viceroy uncle</ecda:anonPers>, and some <rs type="persGroup">guardian nun</rs></l>
            <l>Were all that she e'er had seen by moon or sun.</l>
            <l>No amarous forms, by wanted art designed,</l>
            <l>Had e'er inflamed her blood, or stained her mind:</l>
            <pb/>     
      <fw type="pageNum">265</fw> 
            <l>No hint in books, no coarse or doubtful phrase</l>
            <l>E'er bade her curious thought explore the maze</l>  
            <l>No glowing dream by memory's pencil drawn</l>
            <l>Had e'er profaned her sleep, and made her blush at dawn.</l>
            <l>With <ecda:flora>flowers</ecda:flora> she decked the <rs type="person" ref="#mary_0001">virgin mother's</rs> shrine,</l>
            <l>Nor guessed a wonder made that name divine.</l>
            <l>The very love, which lent her looks such fire,</l>
            <l>Ne'er raised one blameful thought, nor loose desire;</l>
            <l>Like streams of gold, which in alembic roll,</l>
            <l>The flames she suffered but refined her soul;</l>
            <l>Made it more free from stain, more light from dross,</l>
            <l>With brighter lustre, and with softer gloss.</l>
            <l>That, which she bore her bridegroom, well might claim</l>
            <l>A brother's love, and bear a sister's name:</l>
            <l>And e'en where now her lips in playful bliss</l>  
            <l>Sealed on <persName ref="#rosalvo_0001">Rosalvo's</persName> eyes a balmy kiss,</l>
            <l>Love's highest, dearest grace she meant to show,</l>
            <l>Nor thought he more could ask, nor she bestow.</l>

             <l>I marked her!—the pennants, how gaily they streamed!—</l>
             <l>How well was she armed for resistance!</l>
             <l>The waves that sustained her, how brightly they beamed</l>  
             <l>In the sun's setting rays, and the sailors all seemed</l>
             <l>To forget the storm-spirit's existence.</l>  
          </lg>  
          <lg>
             <l>But I marked her!—and now from the clouds I descend!</l>
             <l>My spells to the billows I mutter!</l>
             <l>I clap my black pinions! my wand I extend,</l>  
             <l>In darkness the sky and the ocean to belnd,</l>
             <l>And the winds mark the charms which I utter.</l>  
          </lg>  
          <lg>
             <l>Now more and more rapid in eddies I whirl,</l>

             <l>And now the white mountainous waves, as they curl,</l>  
             <l>I joy o'er the deck of the vessel to hurl,</l>
             <l>And laugh, as she tosses and tumbles.</l>

             <l>The crew is alarmed; but the tempest prevails,</l>

             <l>Ere there's time for their furling the canvass, the sails</l>  
             <l>From the top to the bottom I split with my nails,</l>
             <l>And they stream in the blast, rent in shivers!</l>  
          </lg>  
          <lg>
             <l>The sky and the ocean, fierce battle they wage;</l>
             <l>The elements all are in action!</l>
             <l>No sailor the storm longer hopes to assuage:</l>  
             <l>What clamours, what hurry, what oaths, and what rage!</l>

             <l>Their heart-strings, they ache, while my ravage they view;</l>

             <l>My eyes, darting lightnings to dazzle the crew</l>  
             <l>Burn and blaze; and those lightnings so forked and so blue</l>

             <l>Now I plunge from the sky to the deck with a spring</l>

             <l>While my spouts the salt billows are drinking:</l>
             <l>And I drive 'gainst the vessel, and beat down the stern,</l>  
             <l>And pour in a flood, which shall never return,</l>

             <l>But now all my spouts from the clouds I discharge,</l>

          <l>Full rose the watery moon: it showed a plank,</l>

          <l>A fair frail form:—'twas <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza</persName>—to the shore</l>
          <l>Each following wave the virgin nearer bore;</l>
          <l>And now the mountain surge o'erwhelmed the land,</l>
          <l>Then flying left her on the wished-for strand.</l>
     
         </lg>
         <lg> 
          <l>Soon hope and love of life her powers renew;</l>
          <l>Swift tow'rds a cliff she speeds, which towers in view,</l>
          <l>Nor waits the wave's return; and now again</l>
          <l>Safe on the shore, and rescued from the main,</l>
          <l>Prostrate she falls, and thanks the Sire of life,</l>
          <l>Whose arm hath snatched her from the billowy strife.</l>
          <l>That duty done, she rose, and gazed around:</l>
          <l>Mossed are the rocks, and flowers bestrew the ground.</l>
          <l>Not distaint far, a group of fragrant trees</l>
          <l>Bend with their golden <ecda:flora ana="#food">fruit</ecda:flora>. The ocean-breeze</l>
          <l>Shakes a gigantic <ecda:flora>palm</ecda:flora>, which o'er a cave</l>
          <l>Its dark green foliage spreads, and wildly wave</l>
          <l>Their blooming wreaths, all starred with midnight dws,</l>
          <l>A thousand creeping plants of thousand hues.</l>
          <l>Then flashed the dreadful truth on <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza's</persName> view!</l>
          <l>That cave—those trees—that giant <ecda:flora>palm</ecda:flora> she knew!</l>
          <l>Then from her lips for ever fled the smile:</l>
          <l>—<said rend="quotes">Mother of God!</said> she shrieked, <said rend="quotes">The <placeName>Demon-Isle!</placeName>—</said></l>
     </lg>
         <lg> 
           <l>Long on a broken crag she knelt, and prayed,</l>
           <l>And wearied every saint for strength and aid;</l>
           <l>Then speechless, heedless, senseless lay; when, lo!</l>
           <l>Strange mutterings near her roused from torpid woe</l>
           <l>Her soul to fresh alarms. Her head she reared,</l>
           <l>And near her face a hideous face appeared;</l>
           <l>But straight 'twas gone!—In trembling haste she rose,</l>
           <l>And saw a ring of monstrous dwarfs inclose</l>
            <l>Her rugged couch. Not <persName ref="#tenier_david_1610">Teniers'</persName> hand could paint</l>
           <l>Forms more grotesque to scare the tempted saint,</l>
           <l>Than here, as on they pressed in circling throng,</l>
           <l>And grinned, and glared, and gloated! Quicker grew</l>

            <pb/>  
      <fw type="pageNum">272</fw>     
            <l>Far off they kept; but soon, more daring grown,</l>
           <l>More near they crept, oft sharpening on the stone</l>
           <l>Their long crookt claws; and still, as on they came,</l>
           <l>They screeched and chattered; and their eyes of flame,</l>
           <l>Twinkling and goggling, told, what pleasure grim</l>
           <l>'Twould give to rack and rend her limb from limb:</l>
           <l>―<said rend="quotes">Heaven take my soul!</said> she cried, when, hark! a moan,</l>
           <l>So full, so sad, so strange—not shriek—not groan—</l>
           <l>Something scarce earthly—breathed above her head—</l>    
           <l>'Twas heard, and instant every imp was fled.</l>

         <lg> 
          <l>What was that sound? What pitying saint from high</l>
          <l>Had stooped to save her? Now to heaven her eye</l>
          <l>Grateful she raised. Almighty powers!—a form,</l>
          <l>Gigantic as the palm, black as the storm,</l>
          <l>All shagged with hair, wild, strange in shape and show,</l>
          <l>Towered on the loftiest cliff and gazed below.</l>
          <l>On <emph rend="italic">her</emph> he gazed, and gazed so fixed, so hard,</l>
          <l>Like knights of bronze some hero's tomb who guard.</l>
          <l>Bright wreaths of scarlet plumes his temple crowned,</l>
          <l>And round his ankles, arms, and wrists were wound</l>
          <l>Unnumbered glassy strings of crystals bright,</l>
          <l><ecda:fauna>Corals</ecda:fauna>, and shells, and <ecda:flora ana="#food">berries</ecda:flora> red and white.</l>
          <l>On <emph rend="italic">her</emph> he gazed, and floods of sable fires</l>
          <l>Rolled his huge eyes, and spoke his fierce desires,</l>
          <l>As on his club, a torn-up <ecda:flora ana="#food">lime</ecda:flora> he leaned.—</l>

          <l>Not long he paused: he now with one quick bound</l>
          <l>Sprang from the cliff, and lighted on the ground.</l>
          <l>Back fled the <rs type="person" ref="irza_0001">maid</rs> in terror; but her fear</l>
          <l>Was needless. Humbly, slowly crept he near,</l>

          <l>And of his neck her footstool would have made:</l>
          <l>But from his touch she shrank. He raised his head,</l>
          <l>And saw her limbs convulsed, her face all dread,</l>
             <pb/>      
   <fw type="pageNum">273</fw>  
          <l>And felt the cause his presence! Sad and slow</l>
          <l>He rose, resumed his club, and turn'd to go.</l>
          <l>Reproachful was his look, but still 'twas kind;</l>
          <l>He climb'd the rock, but of he gazed behind;</l>
          <l>He reach'd the cave; one look below he threw;</l>
          <l>plaintive again he moan'd, and with slow steps withdrew.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>  
          <l>She is alone; she breaths again!—Fly, fly!—</l>

          <l>Fast from the wound, and loud the <rs type="person" ref="irza_0001">virgin</rs> scream'd;</l>
          <l>And strait again was heard that sad strange moan,</l>

             <l>One morn her savage lord, in quest of food,</l>
             <l>Forsook the cave, and sought th' adjacent wood;</l>
             <l>And as her darling boy he with him bore,</l>
             <l><persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza</persName>, unwatch'd, might pace the sounding shore.</l>
             <l>Listless and slow she moved, and climb'd with pain</l>
             <l>A tow'ring cliff, which beetled o'er the main.</l>
             <l>Now three full years had flown, since <persName ref="#irza_0001">Irza's</persName> eye</l>
             <l>Had dwelt on human form, and since reply</l>
             <l>From human tongue had blest her ear. 'Tis true,</l>
             <l>Throned on a rock, which spread before her view</l>
             <l>The sea's wide-stretching plains, she once descried</l>
             <l>A gallant vessel plough the neighbouring tide.</l>
             <l>By cries to draw it near she long essay'd,</l>
             <l>And oft a <ecda:flora>palm-bough</ecda:flora> waved in sign for aid:</l>
             <l>But all her cries and all her signs were vain;</l>
             <l>On sail'd the bark, nor e'er return'd again!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
             <l>On that same rock she sat, and eyed the wave,</l>

             <l>Fain had she sought one then, plunged from the steep,</l>
             <l>And buried all her suff'rings in the deep;</l>
             <l>But faith alike and reason bade her shun</l>
             <l>That wish, nor break a thread which God had spun.</l>
             <l>Hark!—was it fancy?—hark again!—the shores</l>

             <l>At length this wonder reach'd the <ecda:anonPers>abbot's</ecda:anonPers> ear,</l>

<p>I regret the loss of our dead calm and our crawling
    pace of a knot and a half an horu; for during 
    the last four days we have had nothing but gales
    and squalls, mountainous waves, the vessel rolling
    and pitching incessantly, and the sea perpetually
    pouring in at the windows and down through the
    hatchway. Into the bargain, we are now sufficiently
    towards the north to find the weather perishingly
    cold, and we have neither wood nor coals
    enough on board to allow a fire for the cabin. 
   <pb/> 
   <fw type="pageNum">290</fw> 
    But, among all our inconveniences, that which
    is the most intolerable undoubtedly arises from
    the <ecda:anonPers>sick apothecary</ecda:anonPers>. It seems that his complaint
   is the consequence of dram-drinking, which has
   affected his liver. Since his coming on board, he 
   has continued to indulge his taste; and growing
   worse (as might be expected), he has now thought 
   proper to put himself in a state of salivation: the 
   consequence is, that what with the <seg ana="#medical"></seg> and
   what with the man, aided by the concomitant
   effluviva of our cargo of <ecda:commodity ana="#transport #flora #food">sugar, rum, and coffee</ecda:commodity>, for

      <p>I have not been able to ascertain exactly the
         negro notions concerning the <distinct type="dialect" rend="italic">Duppy</distinct>; indeed, I
         believe that his character and qualities must vary in
         different parts of the country. At first, I thought
         that the term <distinct type="dialect">Duppy</distinct> meant neither more nor less
         <pb/> 
         <fw type="pageNum">291</fw>  
         than a ghost; but sometimes he is spoken of as
         <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes">the Duppy</distinct>, as if there were but one, and then
         he seems to answer to the devil. Sometimes he is
         a kind of malicious spirit, who haunts burying-
         grounds (like the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> gouls), and delights
         in playing tricks to those who may pass that way.
         On other occasions, <seg ana="#obeah">he seems to be a supernatural
         attendant on the practitioners of <name ana="#obeah">Obeah</name>, in the
         shape of some animal</seg>, as familiar imps are supposed

            her <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers> died, and bequeathed to her a considerable

            the guardianship of the child devolved upon his
            <ecda:anonPers>sister</ecda:anonPers>, who had always resided in the same house,
            and who was her only surviving relation. Her
            mother, indeed, had left <rs type="persGroup">two sons</rs> by a former <ecda:anonPers>husband</ecda:anonPers>,
            but they lived at some distance in the wood,
            and seldom came to see their <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers>; chiefly from
            a rooted aversion to this <ecda:anonPers>aunt</ecda:anonPers>; who, although from
            interested motives she stooped to flatter her <ecda:anonPers>sister-

            an <ecda:fauna>enormous black dog</ecda:fauna>, whom she called <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna>,
            and whom she never failed to feed and caress with

            stacle to her wishes; and after treating her for
            some time with harshness and even cruelty, she
            one night took occasion to quarrel with her for
            some trifling fault, and fairly turned her out of
            doors. The poor girl seated herself on a stone
            near the house, and endeavoured to beguile the
            time by singing—

            But her song was soon interrupted by a loud rushing 
            among the bushes; and the growling which
            accompanied it announced the approach of the 
            dreaded <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna>. She endeavoured to secure herself
            against his attacks by climbing a <ecda:flora>tree</ecda:flora>: but it seems
            that <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna> had not been suspected of <name ana="#obeah">Obeahism</name>
            without reason; for he immediately growled out
            an assurance to the girl, that come down she must
            and should! Her <ecda:anonPers>aunt</ecda:anonPers>, she said, had made her
            over to him by contract, and had turned <emph rend="italic">her</emph> out
            of doors that night for the express purpose of
            giving him an opportunity of carrying her away.
            If she would descend from the <ecda:flora>tree</ecda:flora>, and follow
            him willingly to his own den to wait upon him, he
            engaged to do her no harm; but if she refused to
            do this, he threatened to gnaw down the <ecda:flora>tree</ecda:flora> without
            loss of time, and tear her into a thousand 
            pieces. His long sharp teeth, which he gnashed
            occasionally during the above speech, appeared 
            <pb/> 
            <fw type="pageNum">293</fw> 
            perfectly adequate to the execution of his menaces,
            and <persName ref="#sarah_winyan_0001">Sarah</persName> judged it most prudent to obey his commands.
            But as she followed <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna> into the wood,
            she took care to resume her song of
            <quote><said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Ho-day, poor me, O!</distinct></said></quote>
            in hopes that some one passing near them might
            hear her name, and come to her rescue. <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna>,
            however, was aware of this, and positively forbad
            her singing. However, she contrived every now
            and then to loiter behind; and when she thought
            him out of hearing, her
            <quote><said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Ho-day, poor me, O!</distinct></said></quote>
            began again; although she was compelled to sing 
            in so low a voice, through fear of her four-footed
            master, that she had but faint hopes of its reaching
            any ear but her own. Such was, indeed, the event,
            and <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna> conveyed her to his den withouth molestation.
            In the meanwhile, her <rs type="persGroup">two half-brothers</rs>
            had heard of their <ecda:anonPers>mother's</ecda:anonPers> death, and soon arrived
            at the house to enquire what was become of 
            <persName ref="#sarah_winyan_0001">Sarah</persName>. The <ecda:anonPers>aunt</ecda:anonPers> received them with every appearance
            of welcome; told them that grief for the loss
            of her only surviving <ecda:anonPers>parent</ecda:anonPers> had already carried
            her niece to the grave, which she showed them in
            her garden; and acted her part so well, that the
            <rs type="persGroup">youths</rs> departed perfectly satisfied of the decease
            of their <ecda:anonPers>sister</ecda:anonPers>. But while passing through the
            wood on their return, they heard some one singing,
            but in so low a tone that it was impossible to

            distinguish the words. As this part of the wood
            was the most unfrequented, they were surprised
            to find any one concealed there. Curiosity induced
            them to draw nearer, and they soon could make

            There needed no more to induce them to hasten
            onwards; and upon advancing deeper into the
            thickety, they found themselves at the mouth of
            a large cavern in a rock. A fire was burning
            within it; and by its light they perceived their 
            sister seated on a heap of stones, and weeping, while
            she chanted her melancholy little ditty in a low voice,
            and supported on her lap the head of the formidable
            <ecda:fauna><name>Tiger</name></ecda:fauna>. This was a precaution which he
            always took when inclined to sleep, lest she should
            escape; and when she had taken advantage of his slumber
            to resume her song in as low a tone as her
            fears of waking him would allow. She saw her

            possible. It was long before she could summon
            up courage enough to make the attempt; but at
            length, with fear and trembling, and moving with 
            the utmost caution, she managed to slip a log of
            wood between her knees and the frightful head,
            and at length drew herself away without waking 
            him. She then crept softly out of the cavern, while

            <fw type="pageNum">295</fw> 
            the <ecda:anonPers>youngest brother</ecda:anonPers> crept as softly into it: the
            monster's head still reposed upon the block of 
            wood; in a moment it was blown into a thousand 
            pieces; and the <rs type="persGroup">brothers</rs>, afterwards cutting the
            body into four parts, laid each one in a quarter of
            the wood.

         <pb/> 
         <fw type="pageNum">296</fw> 
         introduced at the court of <placeName>Angola</placeName>. It took surprisingly;
         shortly, no woman thought her toilette
         completed, unless she had used some of the ointment.
         Pounding children became all the rage;
         and ladies who aspired to be leaders of fashion,
         pounded ther own.

      <p>The weather gets no better, the apothecary gets
         no worse, and both are as foul and as disagreeable

         He drinks, and he stinks, and he does nothing else

      <p>A gale of wind began to show itself on Monday
         night; it has continued to blow ever since with
         increasing violence, and is now become very serious.
         The <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> says that he never experienced
         weather so severe at this season: this is only my
         usual luck. Certainly nothing can be more disagreeable 
         than a ship on these occasions. The sea breaks
         over the vessel every minute, and it is really something
         awful to see the waves raised into the air
         by the force of the gale, hovering for a while over
         the ship, and then coming down upon us swop, to
         inundate every thing below deck as well as upon
         it. The wind is piercingly cold; the floors and
         walls are perpetually streaming. But a fire is quite
         out of the question; and, indeed, at one time to-day,
         our eating appeared to be out of the question too;
         for at four o'clock the <ecda:anonPers>cook</ecda:anonPers> sent us word, that the
         sea put the kitchen-fire out as fast as he could light
         <pb/> 
         <fw type="pageNum">298</fw> 
         it; that he was almost frozen, having been for the
         last eight hours up to his waist in water; and that we
         must make up our minds to get no dinner to-day.
         However, the <ecda:anonPers>steward</ecda:anonPers> coaxed him, and encouraged 
         him, and poured <ecda:food>spirits</ecda:food> down his throat, and at last
         a <ecda:food>dinner</ecda:food> of some kind as put upon the table; but
         it had not been there ten minutes, before a tremendous
         sea poured itself down the companion stairs and
         through the hatchway, set every thing on the table
         afloat, deluged the cabin, ducked most of the company,
         and drove us all into the other room. I was
         lucky enough to escape with onlya sprinkling;
         but <persName ref="#walker_0001">Mrs Walker</persName> was soked through from head to
         foot. We can only cross the cabin by creeping
         along by the sides as if we were so many <ecda:fauna>cats</ecda:fauna>. 
         Walking the deck, even for the <rs type="persGroup">sailors</rs>, is absolutely
         out of the question; and the little <rs type="person" ref="#jem_parsons_0001">cabin-boy</rs> has
         so fairly given up on the attempt, that he goes crawling
         about upon all fours. Even our <ecda:fauna><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> mastiff, 
         <name>Flora</name></ecda:fauna>, finds it impossible to keep her four legs
         upon deck. Every five minutes they all go,
         away rolls the <ecda:fauna>dog</ecda:fauna> over and over; and when she
         gets up again, shakes her ears, and howls in a tone
         of the most piteous astonishment.

      <p>Though the gale was itself sufficiently serious,
         its effects were at first ludicrous enough; but yesterday
         it produced a consequence truly shocking
         and alarming. <persName ref="#edward_sadler_0001">Edward Sadler</persName>, the second mate,
         <pb/> 
         <fw type="pageNum">299</fw> 
         was at breakfast in the steerage: the <ecda:anonPers>boatswain</ecda:anonPers>
         had been cutting some <ecda:food ana="#fauna">beef</ecda:food> with a large case-knife,
         which he had aftewards put down upon the chest
         on which they were sitting: a sudden heel of
         the ship threw them all to the other side of the
         cabin: the knife fell with its haft against the ladder;
         and poor <persName ref="#edward_saddler_0001">Edward</persName> falling against it, at least
         <measure>three inches</measure> of the blade were forced into his
         right side. The wound was dressed without the
         loss of a moment; but, from its depth, the jaggedness
         of the weapon with which it was made,
         and from a pain which immediately afterwards
         seized the poor fellow in his chest, the apothecary
         thinks that his recovery is very improbable:
         he says that the liver is certainly perforated, and
         so probably are the lings. If the latter have
         escaped, it must have been only by the breadth of
         a hair. Every one in the ship is distressed beyond
         measure at this accident, for the young man
         is a universal favourite. He is but just one and
         twenty, good-looking, with manners much superior 
         to his station; and so unusually steady, as well as
         active, that if Providence grants him life, he cannot 
         fail to raise himself in his profession.

           considerable sum at play. On his departure he loaded 
           his host with caresses, and insisted on his coming
           in person to receive payment at court; but his
           pretended kindness had not deceived the <ecda:anonPers>nurse</ecda:anonPers> of
           the <ecda:anonPers>young man</ecda:anonPers>. She told him, that the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> 
           was certainly incensed against him for having
           conquered him at play, and meant to do him some
           injury; that having been so positively ordered to 
           come to court, he could not avoid obeying; but
           she advised him to take the river-road, where, at a
           particular hour, he would find the king's <ecda:anonPers>youngest
           and favourite daughter</ecda:anonPers> bathing; and she instructed
           him how to behave. The <ecda:anonPers>youth</ecda:anonPers> reached the river, and 
           concealed himself, till he saw the <ecda:anonPers>princess</ecda:anonPers> enter
           the stream alone; but when she thought fit to regain
           the bank, she found herself extremely embarrassed.

           said he, stepping from his concealment: <said rend="quotes">a rogue

           to you. You are going to court, I know;
           and I know also, that the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> will chop off
           your head, unless at first sight you can tell him
           which of his <rs type="persGroup">three daughters</rs> is the youngest.
           Now I am she; and in order that you may not
           mistake, I will take care to make a sign; and then
           do not you fail to pitch upon me.</said> The <ecda:anonPers>young
           man</ecda:anonPers> assured her, that, having once seen her, he 
           never could possibly mistake her for any other,
           and then set forwards with a lightened heart. The
           <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> received him very graciously, feasted
           him with magnificence, and told him that he
           would present him to his <rs type="persGroup">three daughters</rs>, only
           that there was a slight rule respecting them to
           which he must conform. Whoever could not
           point out which was the youngest, must immediately
           lose his head. The <ecda:anonPers>young man</ecda:anonPers> kissed the
           ground in obedience, the door opened, and in
           walked three <ecda:fauna>little black dogs</ecda:fauna>. Now, then, the
           necessity of the precaution taken by the <ecda:anonPers>princess</ecda:anonPers>
           was evident; the youth looked at the <ecda:fauna>dogs</ecda:fauna>
           earnestly; something induced the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> to
           turn away his eyes for a moment, and in that
           moment of of the <ecda:fauna>dogs</ecda:fauna> lifted up its fore paw.

           <rs type="persGroup">three young women</rs> apepared in their stead.
           The <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> was equally surprised and incensed;
           but concealing his rage, he professed the more 
           pleasure at that discovery; because, in consequence,
           the law of that country obliged him to
           give his <ecda:anonPers>youngest daughter</ecda:anonPers> in marriage to the
           person who should recognise her; and he charged
           his future son-in-law to return in a week, when he
           should receive his bride. But his feigned caresses
           could no longer deceive the <ecda:anonPers>young man</ecda:anonPers>: as it was
           evident that the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> practiced <name ana="obeah">Obeah</name>, he did
           not dare to disobey him; and knew that to escape

           with melancholy forebodings that he set out for
           court with the appointed day; and (according to
           the advice of his old <ecda:anonPers>nurse</ecda:anonPers>) he failed not to take
           the road which led by the river. The <ecda:anonPers>princess</ecda:anonPers> 
           came again to bathe; her clothes again vanished; 
           she had again recourse to her <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Ho-day!
           what is become of my clothes</distinct>?</said> and on hearing
           the same promise of protection, the <ecda:anonPers>youth</ecda:anonPers> again
           made his appearance. <said rend="quotes">Here are your clothes,
           missy,</said> said he <said rend="quotes">the wind had blown them away
           to a great distance; I found them hanging upon
           the <ecda:flora>bushes</ecda:flora>, and have brought them back to you.</said>
           Probably the princess thought it rather singular,
           that whenever her petticoats were missing, the
           same person should always happen to be in the
           <pb/> 
           <fw type="pageNum">304</fw> 
           way to find them: however, as he was remarkably
           handsome, she kept her thoughts to herself, swallowed
           the story like so much <ecda:food>butter</ecda:food>, and assured
           him of her protection. <said rend="quotes">My father,</said> said she,
           <said rend="quotes">will again ask you which is the youngest daughter;
           and as he suspects me of having assisted you
           before, he threatens to chop off <emph rend="italic">my</emph> head instead
           of yours, should I disobey him a second time.
           He will, therefore, watch me too closely to allow
           of my making any sign to you; but still I will contrive 
           something to distinguish me from my sisters;
           and do you examine us narrowly till you find it.</said>
           As she had foretold, the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> no sooner saw
           his destined son-in-law enter, than he told him
           that he should immediately point her out, the
           laws of the kingdom sentenced him to lose his
           head. Upon which the door opened, and in walked
           three <ecda:fauna>large black cats</ecda:fauna>, so exactly similar in every
           respect, that it was utterly impossible to distinguish
           one from the other. The youth was at length on
           the point of giving up the attempt in despair,
           when it struck him, that each of the <ecda:fauna>cats</ecda:fauna> had a
           slight thread passed round its neck; and that while
           the threads of two were scarlet, that of the third
           was blue. <said rend="quotes"><emph>This</emph> is your youngest daughter;</said>
           cried he, snatching up the <ecda:fauna>cat</ecda:fauna> with the blue thread.
           The headman was utterly at a loss to conceive by 
           what means he had made the discovery; but could
           not deny the fact, for there stood the princesses in 
           <pb/> 
           <fw type="pageNum">305</fw>    
           their own shape. He therefore affected to be
           greatly pleased, gave him his bride, and made a
           great feast, which was followed by a ball; but in
           the midst of it the <ecda:anonPers>princess</ecda:anonPers> whispered her <ecda:anonPers>lover</ecda:anonPers> to
           follow her silently into the garden. Here she told 
           him, that an <ecda:anonPers>old <name ana="#obeah">Obeah</name> woman</ecda:anonPers>, who had been
           her father's nurse, had warned him, that if his
           <ecda:anonPers>youngest daughter</ecda:anonPers> should live to see the day after
           her wedding, he would lose his power and his life
           together; that she, therefore, was sure of his intending 
           to destroy both herself and her bridegroom
           that night in their sleep; but that, being aware of
           all these circumstances, she had watched him so 
           narrowly as to get possession of some of his magical
           secrets, which might possibly enable her to
           counteract his cruel designs. She then gathered
           a <seg ana="#obeah"><ecda:flora>rose</ecda:flora>, picked up a pebble, filled a small phial with
           water from a rivulet</seg>; and thus provided, she and
           her <ecda:anonPers>lover</ecda:anonPers> betook themselves to flight upon a couple
           of the swiftest <ecda:fauna>steeds</ecda:fauna> in her father's stables. It was
           midnight before the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> missed them: his
           rage was excessive; and immediately mounting his
           great horse, <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna>, he set forwards in pursuit of
           the lovers. Now <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna> galloped at the rate of 
           <measure>ten miles a minute</measure>. The princess was soon aware
           of her pursuer: without loss of time she pulled
           the <ecda:flora>rose</ecda:flora> to pieces, scattered the <ecda:flora>leaves</ecda:flora> behind 
           her, and had the satisfaction of seeing them 
           instantly grow up into a <ecda:flora>wood</ecda:flora> of <ecda:flora>briars</ecda:flora>, so
           strong and so thickly planted, that <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna> vainly
           <pb/> 
           <fw type="pageNum">306</fw> 
           attempted to force his way through them. But,
           alas! this fence was but of a very perishable nature.
           In the time that it would have taken to
           wither its parent <ecda:flora>rose-leaves</ecda:flora>, the <ecda:flora>briars</ecda:flora> withered
           away; and <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna> was soon able to trample them
           down, while he continued his pursuit. Now, then,
           the pebble was thrown in his passage; it burst into
           forty pieces, and every piece in a minute became
           a rock as lofty as the <placeName>Andes</placeName>. But the <placeName>Andes</placeName> 
           themselves would have offered no insurmountable
           obstacles to <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna>, who bounded from precipice
           to precipice; and the <rs type="persGroup">lovers</rs> and the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers>
           could once moe clearly distinguish each other by
           the first beams of the rising sun. The <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers>
           roared, and threatened, and brandished a monstrous
           sabre; <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna> tore up the ground as he ran,
           neighed louder than thunder, and gained upon the
           fugitives every moment. Despair left the princess
           no choice, and she violently dashed her phial upon
           the ground. Instantly the water which it contained
           swelled itself into a tremendous torrent, which carried 
           away every thing before it,—rocks, <ecda:flora>trees</ecda:flora>, and 
           houses; and <quote rend="quotes" source="#bible">the horse and his rider</quote> were carried
           away among the rest.—<quote rend="quotes" source="#virgil_aeneid"><foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="la">Hic finis <persName ref="#priam_0001">Priami</persName> fatorum</foreign>!</quote>
           There was an end to the <ecda:anonPers>headman</ecda:anonPers> and <ecda:fauna><name>Dandy</name></ecda:fauna>!
           The <ecda:anonPers>princess</ecda:anonPers> then returned to court, where she
           raised a strong party for herself;seized her <rs type="persGroup">two
           sisters</rs>, who were no better than their <ecda:anonPers>father</ecda:anonPers>, and
           had assisted him in his witchcraft; and having put 
           them and <rs type="persGroup">all their partisans</rs> to death by a summary
           <pb/> 
           <fw type="pageNum">307</fw> 
           mode of proceeding, she established herself and 
           her <ecda:anonPers>husband</ecda:anonPers> on the throne as headman and headwoman.
           It was from this time that <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the <rs type="persGroup">kings

          too ill to swallow a morsel: and at length they
          were oblived to leave him, and go take care of

          was quite shocked to see the size to which the

          were by no means so delicate; and seizing him
          forcibly by the head to examine it, she undesignedly
          happened to hit him a great knock on the 
          jaw, and, lo and behold! out flew a large <ecda:flora ana="#food">lime</ecda:flora>,
          which he had crammed into it. Upon which both

         the wind to seek refuge in the <placeName>Sound</placeName>. Here
         
         
         however, we soon found that we had but little
         reason to rejoice at the change of our situation.
         The <placeName>Sound</placeName> was already crowded with vessels of
         all descriptions; and as we arrived so late, the only
         mooring still unoccupied, placed us so near the 
         rocks on one side, and another vessel astern, that the
         <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> confessed that he should feel considerable
         anxiety if the gale should return with its former 
         violence. So, of course, about eleven at night,
         the gale <emph rend="italic">did</emph> return; not, indeed, with its former
         violence, but with its violence increased tenfold;
         and once we were in very imminent danger from
          our ship's swinginground by a sudden squall, and
          narrowly escaping coming in contact with the ship
          astern, which had not, it seems, allowed itself sufficeint 
          cable. Luckily, we just missed her; and our
          cables (for both our anchor were down) being
          new and good, we rode out the storm without
          driving, or meeting with any accident whatever.
          The next day was squally; and in spite of the <name>Breakwater</name>,
         the rocking of the ship from the violent
         agitation of the waves by the late stormy weather
         was almost insupportable. However, on the <date when="1817-12-09">9th</date>,
         the wind took a more favorable turn, though in
         so slight a degree, that the <ecda:anonPers>pilot</ecda:anonPers> expressed great
         doubts whether it would last long enough to do us any
         service. But the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> felt his situation in <placeName>Plymouth
         Sound</placeName> so uneasy, that he resolved at least
         to make the attempt; and so we crept once more 
         into the <placeName>Channel</placeName>. In a few hours the breeze
         
         
         
         strengthened; about midnight we passed the lights
         upon the <placeName>Lizard</placeName>, and the next morning <placeName>England</placeName>
         was at length out of sight. This cessation of ill
         luck soon proved to be only <quote rend="quotes"><foreign rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">reculer pour mieux
         sauter</foreign></quote>. The gale, it seems, had only stopped
         to take breath: about four in the afternoon of 
         Wednesday, the wind began to rise again; and
         from that time till the middle of the <date when="1817-12-23">23d</date> it blew
         a complete  storm day and night, with only an 
         occasional intermission of two or three hours at a
         time. Every one in the ship declared that they
         had never before experienced so obstinate a persecution
         of severe weather: every rag of sail was 
         obliged to be taken down; the sea was blown up
         into mountains, and poured itself over the deck
         repeatedly. The noise was dreadful; and as it
         lasted incessantly, to sleep was impossible; and I
         pased ten nights, one after another, without closing
         mye eyes; so that the pain in the nerves of them
         at length became almost intolerable, and i began
         to be seriously afraid of going blind. In truth,
         the <rs type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> could not have pitched upon a
         set of passengers worse calculated to undergo the
         trial of a passage so rough. As for myself, my
         brain is so weak, that the continuation of any violent 
         noise makes me absolutely light-headed; and
         a pop-gun going off suddenly is sufficient at
         any time to set every nerve shaking, from the 
         crown of my head to the sole of my foot. Then
         we had a <ecda:anonPers>young lady</ecda:anonPers> who was ready to die of sea-
         
         
         
         sickness, and an <ecda:anonPers>old one</ecda:anonPers> who was little better
         through fright; and I had an <ecda:anonPers><rs type="properAdjective">Italian</rs> servant</ecda:anonPers> into
         the bargain, who was as sick as the <ecda:anonPers>young lady</ecda:anonPers>,
         and as frightened as the <ecda:anonPers>old one</ecda:anonPers>.The poor fellow
         had never been on board a ship before; and with
         every crack which the vessel gave, he thought that
         to be sure, she was splitting right in half. The
         <rs type="persGroup">sailors</rs>, too, appeared to be quite knocked up from
         the unremitting fatigue to which they were subjected
         by the perseverence of this dreadful weather.
         <rs type="persGroup">Several of them</rs> were ill; and <ecda:anonPers>one poor fellow</ecda:anonPers> 
         actually died, and was committeed to the ocean.
         To make matters still worse, during the first week
          the wind was as foul as it could blow; and we
          passed it in running backwards and forwards, without
          advancing a step towards our object; till at 
          length every drop of my small stock of patience
          was exhausted, and I could no longer resist
          suggesting our returning to port, rather than continue
          buffeting about in the <placeName>chops of the Channel</placeName>,
         so much to the damage of the ship, and all contained
         in her. A change of wind, however, gave
         a complete answer to this proposal. On Thursday
         it became favourable as to the prosecution of our
         voyage, but its fury continued unabated till the
         evening of the <date when="1817-12-23">23d</date>. It then gradually died away,
         and left us becalmed before the island of <placeName>Madeira</placeName>;
         where we are now rolling backwards and forwards,
         in sight of its capital, <placeName>Funchal</placeName>, on the <date when="1817-12-24">24th of 
         December</date>, being seven immortal weeks since my
         
         
         departure from <placeName>Gravesend</placeName>. The evening sun is now
         very brilliant, and shines full upon the island, the
         rocks of which are finely broken; the neight of the 
         mountains cause their tops to be lost in the clouds;
         the sides are covered with plantations of <ecda:flora>vines</ecda:flora> and
         forests of <ecda:flora>cedars</ecda:flora>; and the white edifices of <placeName>Funchal</placeName>,
         built upon the very edge of the shore, have a truly
         picturesque appearance. We are now riding between
         the island and an isolated groupe of inacessible
         rocks called <distinct rend="quotes" type="geographical"><placeName>the Deserters</placeName></distinct>* and the effect
         of the scene altogether is beautiful in the extreme.

      <p>On <date when="1818-01-03">Saturday, the 3d</date>, we managed to crawl over
         the line, and had no sooner got to the other side of
         it, than we were completely becalmed; and even
         when we resumed our progress, it was at such a
         pace that a careless observer might have been
         pardoned for mistaking our manner of moving for
         a downright standing still. Day after day produced
         nothing better for us than baffling winds, so
         light that we scarcely made <measure>two miles an hour</measure>, and
         so variable that the sails could scarcely set in 
         one direction before it became necessary to shift
         them to another; while the monotony of our
         voyage was only broken by an occasional thunder-
         storm, the catching a stray <ecda:fauna>dolphin</ecda:fauna> now and then,
         watching a shoal of <ecda:fauna>flying fish</ecda:fauna>, or guessing at the 
         complexion of the <rs type="persGroup">corsairs</rs> on board some vessel in

         all over like a painter's palette with corsairs of all

         <placeName>Carthegena</placeName>, white from <placeName>North America</placeName>, and pea-
         green from the <placeName>Cape de Verd Islands</placeName>. On the
         afternoon of the <date when="1818-01-04">4th</date>, one of them was at no very
         great distance from us; she hoisted <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> colours
         on seeing ours; but there was little doubt,from her
         peculiar construction and general appearance, that 
         she was a privateer from <placeName>Carthegena</placeName>. She set
         her head towards us, and seemed to be doing her
         best to come to a nearer acquaintance; but the
         same calm which hindered us from bravely runing
         away from her, hindered her also from reaching 
         us, although at nightfall she seemed to have
         gained upon us. In the night we had a violent 
         thunder-storm, and the next morning she was not
         to be seen. Still we continued to creep and to
         crawl, grumbling and growling, till on <date when="1818-01-11">Sunday, the
         11th</date>, the long-looked-for wind came at last. The
         trade wind began to blow with all its might and
         main right in the vessel's poop, and sent us forward
         at the rate of <measure>200 miles a day</measure>. We passed
         between <placeName>Deseada</placeName> and <placeName>Antigua</placeName> in the night of the

         the island mountains of <placeName>Montserrat</placeName>; the sight of

         its romantic beauty, than welcome from its giving
         us the assurance that our long-winded voyage is at 
         length drawing towwards its termination.

      <p>Yesterday morning a <ecda:fauna>miniature shark</ecda:fauna> chose to
         swallow the bait laid for <ecda:fauna>dolphins</ecda:fauna>, and in consequence
         soon made his appearance upon deck. It 
         was a very young one, not above <measure>three feet</measure> long.
         I ordered a slice of him to be broiled at <ecda:food>dinner</ecda:food>,

         flew on board, and was knocked down by the <ecda:anonPers>mate</ecda:anonPers>
         with his hat. It was sulky, and would not be presuaded 
         to eat any thing that was offered, so he was
         suffered to escape this morning. It was beautifully
         shaped, with a swallow-tail, wings of an extraordinary
         spread in comparison with the smallenss
         of the body, a long sharp bill, black and polished
         like a piece of jet, and eyes remarkably large and
         brilliant. The head, back, and outside of the
         wings were of a brownish slate colour, and the
         rest of his feathers of the most dazzling whiteness.

    <p>Our favourable breeze lasted till Tuesday, the 
       <date when="1818-01-20">20th</date>; when, having brought us half way between
       <placeName>St. Domingo</placeName> and <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, it died away, and we
       dragged on at the rate of <measure>two or three miles an
       
       hour</measure> till Thursday afternoon, which placed us at 
       the mouth of <placeName>Black River</placeName>. If we had arrived one
       hour earlier, we could have immediately entered
       the harbour; but, with our usual good fortune, we
       were just too late for the daylight. We therefore
       did not drop anchor till two o'clock on Friday,
       before the town of <placeName>Black River</placeName>; and on Saturday
       morning, at four o'clock, I embarked in the ship's
       cutter for <placeName>Savannah la Mar</placeName>. Every one assured us
       that we could not fail to have a favourable sea-
       breeze the whole way, and that we should be on
       land by eight: instead of which, what little wind 
       there was veered round from one point of the
       compass to the other with the most indefatigable
       caprice; and we were not on the shore till eleven.
       Here I found <persName ref="#hill_0001">Mr. T. Hill</persName>, who luckily had his
       phaëton ready, in which he immediately conveyed
       me once more to my own estate. The accounts of
       the general behaviour of my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> is reasonably
       good, and they all express themselves satisfied
       with their situation and their superintendents. Yet,
       among upwards of <rs type="persGroup">three hundred and thirty 
       negores</rs>, and with a greater number of females than
       men, in spite of all indulgences and inducements,
       not more than <rs type="persGroup">twelve or thirteen children</rs> have
       been added annually to the list of the births. On 
       the other hand, this last season has been generally
       unhealthy all over the island, and more particularly
       so in my parish; so that I have lost several negroes,
       some of them young, strong, and valuable la-
       
       
       bourers in every respect; and in consequence, my
       sum total is rather diminished than increased since
       my last visit. I had been so positively assured
       that the custom of plunging negro infants, immediately
       upon their being born, into a tub of cold
       water, infallibly preserved them from the danger of
       <seg ana="#disease">tetanus</seg>, that, on leaving <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I had ordered this
       practice to be adopted uniformly. The negro
       mothers, however, took a prejudice against it into
       their heads, and have been so obstinate in their 
       opposition, that it was thought unadvisable to attempt 
       the enforcing this regulation. From this
       and other causes I have lost several infants; but
       I am told, that on other estates in the neighbourhood
       they have been still more unfortuante in
       regard to their children; and one was named to me,
       on which <rs type="persGroup">sixteen</rs> were carried off in the course of 
       three days.

      <p>The joy of the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> on my return was quite
         sufficiently vociferous, and they were allowed today
         for a holiday. They set themselves to singing
         and dancing yesterday, in order to lose no time;
         and to show their gratitude for the indulgence, not
         one of the <rs type="persGroup">five pen-keepers</rs> chose to go to their
         watch last night; the consequence was, that the 
         <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> made their escape, and got into one of my 
         very best <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">cane-pieces</ecda:flora>. The alarm was given;
         my own <rs type="persGroup">servants</rs> and some of the <rs type="persGroup">head people</rs> had
         
         
         grace enough to run down to the scene of action;
         but the greatest part remained quietly in the
         <rs type="place">negro-houses</rs>, beating the gumby-drum, and singing
         their joy for my arrival with the whole strength of 
         their lungs, but without thinking it in the least
         necessary to move so much as a finger-joint in my 
         service. The <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> were at length replaced in
         their pen, but not till the <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #cultivation">cane-piece</ecda:flora> had been
         ruined irretrievably. Such is negro gratitude, and
         such is my reward for all I have suffered on
         ship-board. To be sure, as yet there could not be
         a more ill-starred expedition than my present one.
         I only learned, yesterday, that before making the 
         island of <placeName>Madeira</placeName> an <rs type="properAdjective">Algerine</rs> corsair was actually
         in sight, and near enough to discern the turbans of
         the crew; but we lost each other through the 
         violence of the gale.

   <p>This alludes to a transaction which took place
      some thirty years ago, on an estate in this neighbourhood,
      called <placeName>Spring-Garden</placeName>; the owner of
      which (I think the name was <persName ref="#bedward_0001">Bedward</persName>) is quoted
      
      
      as the cruellest proprietor that ever disgraced
      <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. It was his constant practice, whenever
      a sig negro was pronounced incurable, to order
      the poor wretch to be carried to a solitary vale
      upon his estate, called the <placeName>Gulley</placeName>, where he was
      thrown down, and abandoned to his fate; which
      fate was generally to be half devoured by the
      <ecda:fauna>john-crows</ecda:fauna>, before death had put an end to his 
      sufferings. By this proceeding the aviricious
      owner avoided the expense of maintaining the
      slave during his last illness; and in order that he
      might be as little a loser as possible, he always
      enjoined the negro bearers of the dying man to
      strip him naked before leaving the <placeName>Gulley</placeName>, and not
      to forget to bring back his <ecda:commodity ana="#textile">frock</ecda:commodity> and the board on
      which he had been carried down. One <ecda:anonPers>poor
      creature</ecda:anonPers>, while in the act of being removed,
      screamed out most piteously <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that he was not dead
      yet;</said> and implored not to be left to perish in the
      <placeName>Gulley</placeName> in a manner so horrible. His cries had no
      effect upon his master, but operated so forcibly on
      the less marble hearts of his <rs type="person">fellow-slaves</rs>, that in
      the night some of them removed him back to the
      <rs type="place">negro village</rs> privately, and nursed him there with
      so much care, that he recovered, and left the estate
      unquestioned and undiscovered. Unluckily, one
      day the master was passing through <placeName>Kingston</placeName>,
      when, on turning the corner of a street suddenly,
      he found himself face to face with the <ecda:anonPers>negro</ecda:anonPers>, whom
      he had supposed long ago to have been picked to
      
      
      the bones in the <placeName>Gulley of Spring-Garden</placeName>. He
      immediately seized him, claimed him as his slave,
      and ordered his attendants to convey him to his
      house; but the fellow's cries attracted a crowd
      round them, before he could be dragged away.
      He related his melancholy story, and the singular
      manner in which he had recovered his life and
      liberty; and the public indignation was so forcibly
      excited by the shocking tale, that <persName ref="#bedward_0001">Mr. Bedward</persName>
      was glad to save himself from being torn to pieces
      by a precipitate retreat from <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, and never 
      ventured to advance his claims to the negro a
      second time.

          <p>A <ecda:anonPers>man</ecda:anonPers> has been tried, at <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, for cruel
             treatment of a <rs type="properAdjective">Sambo</rs> female slave, called <persName ref="#amey_0001">Amey</persName>.
             She had no friends to support her cause, nor any
             other evidence to prove her assertions, than the
             apparent truth of her statement, and the marks of
             having been branded in five different places. The
             result was, that the <ecda:anonPers>master</ecda:anonPers> received a most severe
             reprimand for his inhuman conduct, and was sentenced
             to close confinement for six months, while
             the slave, in consequence of her sufferings, was
             restored to the full enjoyment of her freedom.             
          </p>
          <p>It appears to me that nothing could afford so
             much relief to the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, under the existing 
             system of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, as the substituting the labour
             of <ecda:fauna>animals</ecda:fauna> for that of slaves in agriculture, where-
             
             
             ever such a measure is practicable. On leaving
             the island, I impressed this wish of mine upon the
             minds of my agents with all my power; but the
             only result has been the creating of a very considerable
             additional expense in the purchase of 
             <ecda:commodity ana="#use">ploughs</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity">oxen</ecda:fauna>, and <ecda:commodity ana="#use">farming implements</ecda:commodity>; the awkwardness,
             and still more the obstinacy, of the few
             <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, whose services were indispensable, was
             not to be overcome: they broke <ecda:commodity ana="#use">plough</ecda:commodity> after 
             <ecda:commodity ana="#use">plough</ecda:commodity>, and ruined <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity">beast</ecda:fauna> after <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity">beast</ecda:fauna>, till the attempt
             was abandoned in despair. However, it was
             made without the most essential ingredient for
             success, the superintendence of an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> ploughman;
             and such of the <ecda:commodity ana="#use">ploughs</ecda:commodity> as were of cast-iron
             could not be repaired when once broken, and
             therefore ought not to have been adopted; but I
             am told, that in several other parts of the island the
             plough has been introduced, and completely successful.
             Another of my farming speculations 
             answered no better: this was to improve the breed
             of <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> in the county, for which purpose <persName ref="#henry_vassall_fox_1773">Lord 
             Holland</persName> and myself sent over four of the finest
             <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity">bulls</ecda:fauna> that could be procured in <placeName>England</placeName>. One of
             them got a trifling hurt in its passage from the
             vessel to land; but the remaining three were
             deposited in their respective pens without the
             least apparent damage. <seg ana="#disease">They were taken all possible
             care of, houses appropriated to shelter them
             from the sun and rain, and, in short, no means of
             preserving their health was neglected. Yet, shortly
             
             
             after their arrival in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, they evidently began
             to decline; their blood was converted into urine;
             they paid not sort of attention to the <ecda:fauna>cows</ecda:fauna>, who
             were confined in the same paddock; and at the
             end of a fortnight not one was in existence, two
             having died upon the same day. The injured one, 
             having been bled the most copiously in consequence 
             of its hurt, was that which survived the
             longest.</seg>

          <p>Some days ago, a <ecda:anonPers>negro woman</ecda:anonPers>, who had lost
             <rs type="persGroup">four children</rs>, and has always been a most affectionate 
             mother, brought the fifth, a remarkably fine
             <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers>, into the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>. She complained of its
             having caught cold, a fever, and so on; but
             nothing adminstered was of use, and its manner of
             breathing made the <ecda:anonPers>doctor</ecda:anonPers> enquire, whether the
             child had not had a fall? The <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers> denied this
             most positively, and her fondness for the <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers>
             admitted no doubt of her veracity. Still the <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers>
             grew worse and worse; still the question about the 
             fall was repeated, and as constantly denied; until
             luckily being made in the presence of a <ecda:anonPers>new-comer</ecda:anonPers>,
             the latter immediately exclaimed, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that to her
             certain knowledge the <ecda:anonPers>infant</ecda:anonPers> had really had a fall,
             for that the <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers> having fastened it behind her
             back, the knot of the handkerchief had slipped,
             and the <ecda:anonPers>baby</ecda:anonPers> had fallen upon the floor.</said>—<said rend="quotes">It is
             false,</said> answered the <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers>: <said rend="quotes">the <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers> did not
             fall; for when the knot slipped, I had time to catch
             
             
             it by the foot, and so I saved it from folling, just as
             its head struck against the ground.</said> Fear of
             being blamed as having occasioned the <ecda:anonPers>baby's</ecda:anonPers> 
             illness through her own carelessness had induced
             her to adopt this equivocation, and its life had 
             nearly been the sacrifice of her duplicity. A proper
             mode of treatment was now adopted without loss
             of time; their beneficial effect was immediately
             visible, and the <ecda:anonPers>poor little negro</ecda:anonPers> is now recovering
             rapidly. But certainly there is no folly and imprudence
             like unto negro folly and imprudence.
             <ecda:anonPers>One of my best disposed and most sensible <name>Eboes</name></ecda:anonPers>
             has had a violent fever lately, but was so nearly
             well as to be put upon a <seg ana="#medical">course of bark</seg>. On
             Wednesday morning a <ecda:anonPers>son</ecda:anonPers> of his died of dirt-eating,
             —a practice which neither severity nor indulgence
             could induce him to discontinue. The <ecda:anonPers>boy</ecda:anonPers>
             was buried that night according to <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> customs,
             accompanied with dancing, singing, drinking,
             eating, and riot of all kinds; and the <ecda:anonPers>father</ecda:anonPers>,
             although the kindest-hearted negro on my estate,
             and remarkably fond of <rs type="persGroup">his children</rs>, danced and
             drank to such an excess, that I found him on the
             following morning in a <seg ana="#disease">raging fever</seg>, and worse
             than he was when he first entered the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>.
             I had warned him against the consequences of
             the funeral, reminded him of the dangerous malady
             from which he was but just recovering, and he had
             promised solemnly to be upon his guard; and 
             
             such was the manner in which he performed his 
             promise.

       <p>During my former visit to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> I had interceded
          in behalf of a negro belonging to <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>
          estate, named <persName ref="#aberdeen_0001">Aberdeen</persName>, who had run away repeatedly,
          but who attributed his misconduct to the
          decay of his health, which rendered him unable
          to work as well as formerly, and to the fear of 
          consequent punishment for not having performed
          the tasks assigned to him. The fellow while he
          spoke to me had tears running down his cheeks, 
          looked feeble and ill, and indeed seemed to be 
          quite heart-broken. On my speaking to the <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers>,
          he readily promised to enquire into the truth
          of the man's statement, and to take care that he
          should be only allotted such labour as his strength
          might be fully equal to. This morning he came 
          over to see me, and so altered, that I could scarcely
          believe him to be the same man. He was cleanly
          dressed, walked with his head erect, and his eyes
          sparkled, and his mouth grinned from ear to ear,
          while he told me, that during my absence every
          thing had gone well with him, nobody had <said rend="quotes" direct="false">put
          upon him;</said>he had been tasked no more than
          suited his strength; as much as he was able to do,
          he had done willingly, and had never run away.
          Even his <seg ana="#disease">asthma</seg> was better in consequence of
          the depression being removed from his spirits. So,
          he said, as soon as he heard of my return, he thought 
          
          
          it hsi duty to come over and show himself to
          me, and tell me that he was well, and contented,
          and behaving properly; for that <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">to be sure, if
          massa no speak that good word for me to <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>, 
          me no livee now; me good, massa</distinct>!</said> Gratitude
          made him absolutely eloquent: his whole manner, 
          and the strong expression of his countenance, put
          his sincerity out of all doubt, and I never saw a 
          man seem to feel more truly thankful. All <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, 
          therefore, are not absolutely without some
          remembrance of kindness shown them; and indeed 
          I ought not in justice to my own people to allow
          myself to forget, that when I sent a reward to
          those who had roused themselves to drive the
          <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> out of my <ecda:commodity ana="#flora #cultivation">canes</ecda:commodity> the other night, there
          was considerable difficulty in persuading them to 
          accept the <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">money</ecda:commodity>: they sent me word, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that as
          they were all well treated on the estate, it was
          their business to take care that no mischief was
          done to it, and that they did not deserve to be
          rewarded for having merely done their duty by
          me.</said> Nor was it till after they had received repeated
          orders from me, that their delicacy could
          be overcome, and themselves persuaded to pocket
          the affront and the <distinct type="dialect" rend="quotes"><ecda:commodity ana="#currency">maccaroni</ecda:commodity></distinct>.

         <p>One of the deadliest <seg ana="#poison">poisons used by the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
         (and a great variety is perfectly well known to most 
         of them) is prepared from the root of the <ecda:flora>cassava</ecda:flora>
         
         
         Its juice being expressed and allowed to ferment,
         a small worm is generated, the substance of which
         being received into the stomach is of a nature the
         most pernicious. A small portion of this worm is
         concealed under one of the thumb-nails, which are
         suffered to grow long for this purpose; then when
         the negro has contrived to persuade his intended
         victim to eat or drink with him, he takes an opportunity,
         while handing to him a dish or cup, to let
         the worm fall, which never fails to destroy the
         person who swallows it. Another means of destruction
         is to be found (as I am assured) in almost
         every negro garden throughout the island: it is
         the <ecda:flora>arsenic bean</ecda:flora>, neither useful for food nor ornamental
         in its appearance; nor can the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, 
         when questioned, give any reason for affording it a
         place in their gardens; yet there it always is to be
         seen. The <ecda:fauna>alligator's</ecda:fauna> liver also possesses deletrious
         properties; and the gall is said to be still more

        <p>On Friday I was made to observe, in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>,
           a remarkably fine <ecda:anonPers>young negro</ecda:anonPers>, about twenty-
           two years of age, stout and strong, and whom
           every one praised for his numerous good qualities,
           and particularly for his affection for his <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers>,
           and the services which he rendered her. <seg ana="#disease">He complained
           of a little fever, and a slight pain in his

           tended to go to his <rs type="place">provision grounds</rs>, among the
           mountains, on Sunday morning; but, as he complained
           of a pain in his head, his <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers> prevented
           his going, and obliged him to return to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>
           in the evening. On Monday he was seized with
           fainting fits, lost his speech and power of motion,
           and this morning I was awakened by the shrieks and
           lamentations of the poor <ecda:anonPers>mother</ecda:anonPers>, who, on coming
           to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> to enquire for her <ecda:anonPers>son</ecda:anonPers>, found, that
           in spite of all possible care and exertions on the

           <seg ana="#disease">Whether it be the climate not agreeing with their

           for <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>; and, indeed, even for <rs type="persGroup">white

           been unusually numerous this year. As to the
           barracks, which are scarcely a <measure>couple of miles</measure> distant
           from my estate, there the yellow fever has
           established itself, and, as I hear, is committing
           terrible ravages, particularly among the <rs type="persGroup">wives of the
           soldiers</rs>.</seg>—This morning <rs type="persGroup">several negro-mothers
           belonging to <placeName>Friendship</placeName> and <placeName>Greenwich</placeName></rs>, came to
           
           
           
           complain to their <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers> (who happened to be at
           my house) that the <ecda:anonPers>overseer</ecda:anonPers> obliged them to wean
           their <rs type="persGroup">children</rs> too soon. Some of these children
           were above twenty-two months old, and none 
           under eighteen; but, in order to retain the leisure
           and other indulgences annexed to the condition of
           nursing-mothers, the females negroes, by their own
           good-will, would never wean their offspring at all. 
           Of course their demands were rejected, and they
           went home in high discontent; one of them, indeed ,
           not scrupling to declare aloud, and with a 
           peculiar emphasis and manner, that if the <ecda:anonPers>child</ecda:anonPers>
           should be put into the weaning-house against her 
           will, the <ecda:anonPers>attorney</ecda:anonPers> would see it dead in less than a

            least as a negative piece of good luck to have
            reached <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> myself, <quote rend="quotes" source="pratt_gleanings">no bones broke, though
            sore peppered</quote>; but I am still trembling in uncertainty
            for the fate of the fate of the vessel which is bringing out
            all my <rs type="properAdjective">Irish</rs> supplies, and the non-arrival of which
            would be a misfortune to me of serious magnitude.
            
            
            The <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> are so obstinate and so wilful in their
            general character, that if they do not receive the precise
            articles to which they have been accustomed,
            and which they expect as their right, no compensation, 
            however ample, can satisfy them. Thus, at
            every <name>Christmas</name> it would go near to create a rebellion
            if they did not receive a certain proportion 
            of <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food #fauna">salt fish</ecda:commodity>; but if, in the intervening months,
            accident should prevent their receiving their usual
            allowance of <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food #fauna">herrings</ecda:commodity>, the giving them <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food #fauna">salt fish</ecda:commodity> to 
            the amount of double the value would be considered
            by them as an act of the grossest injustice.

          <p>On Saturday, about eight in the evening, a large
             <ecda:fauna>centipeds</ecda:fauna> dropped from the ceiling upon my dinner-
             table, and was immediately cut in two exact halves
             by one of the guests. As it is reported in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>
             that these reptiles, when thus divided, will re-unite
             again, or if separated will reproduce their missing
             members, and continue to live as stoutly as ever, I
             put both parts into a plate, under a glass cover.
             On Sunday they continued to move about their 
             prison with considerable agility, although the tail
             was evidently much more lively and full of motion
             than the head: perhaps the <ecda:fauna>centipede</ecda:fauna> was a female. 
             On Monday the head was dead, but the tail continued
             to run about, and evidently endeavoured to 
             <choice><sic>to</sic><corr></corr></choice> make its escape, although it appeared not to
             know very well how to set about it, nor to be per-
             
             
             fectly determined as to which way it wanted to go:
             it only seemed to have <persName ref="#cymon_0001">Cymon's</persName> reason for wishing
             to take a walk, and <quote rend="quotes" source="garrick_cymon">would rather go any where,
             than stay with any body.</quote> On Wednesday, at
             twelve o'clock, its vivacity was a little abated, but
             only a little; the wound was skinned over, and I
             was waiting anxiously to know whether it would 
             subsist without its numskull till a good old age, or
             would put forth an entirely spick and span new
             head and shoulders; when, on going to look at the 
             plate on Thursday morning, lo and behold! the
             dead head and the living tail had disappeared together.
             I suppose some of the <rs type="persGroup">negro servants</rs> had
             thrown them away through ignorance, but they
             deny, one and all, having so much as touched the
             plate, most stoutly; and as a paper case, pierced 
             in several places, had been substituted for the glass
             cover, some persons are of opinion that the tail
             made its escape through one of these air-holes, and
             carried its head away in its forceps. Be
             this as it may, gone they both are, and I am disappointed
             beyond measure at being deprived of this 
             opportunity of reading the last volume of <title rend="quotes">The
             Life and Adventure of a <ecda:fauna>Centipede's</ecda:fauna> Tail</title>. I have
             proclaimed a reward for the bringing me another,
             but I am told that these reptiles are only found by 
             accident; and that, very possibly, one may not be
             procured previous to my leaving the island.

             in the parish of <placeName>Clarendon</placeName>, had frequently accused
             a <ecda:anonPers>particular negro</ecda:anonPers> of purloining <ecda:commodity ana="#food #flora #circulation">coffee</ecda:commodity>. About six
             months ago, the <ecda:anonPers>slave</ecda:anonPers> was sent for, and charged
             with a fresh offence of the same nature, when he
             confessed the having taken a small quantity; upon
             which his master ordered him to fix his eyes on a
             particular <ecda:flora>cotton tree</ecda:flora>, and then, without any further
             ceremony, shot him through the head. His <ecda:anonPers>mistress</ecda:anonPers>
             was the <ecda:anonPers>coroner's</ecda:anonPers> natural daughter, and the <ecda:anonPers>coroner</ecda:anonPers>
             himself was similarly connected with the <ecda:anonPers>custos</ecda:anonPers> of 
             <placeName>Clarendon</placeName>. In consequence of this family compact,
             no inquest was held, no enquiry was made;
             the whole business was allowed to be slurred over,
             and the murder would have remained unpunished
             if accident had not brought some rumours respecting 
             it to the <rs type="person" ref="#william_montagu_1771">governor's</rs> ear. An investigation was

       <p>My <rs type="place">estate</rs> is greatly plagued by a negress named
          <persName ref="#catalina_0001">Catalina</persName>; she is either mad, or has long pretended
          to be so, never works, and always steals. About a
          
          
          
          week before my arrival she was found in the trash-
          house, which she had pitched upon as the very
          fittest place possible for her kitchen; and there
          she was sitting, very quietly and comfortably, boiling
          her pot over an immense fire, and surrounded
          on all sides by <ecda:commodity ana="#harvest #flora">dry canes</ecda:commodity>, inflammable as tinder.
          This vagary was of too dangerous a nature to allow
          of her being longer left at liberty, and she was put
          into the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>. But her <ecda:anonPers>husband</ecda:anonPers> was by no
          means pleased with her detention, as he never
          failed to appropriate to himself a share of her
          plunder, and when discovered, the blame of the
          robbery was laid upon his wife, in a fit of insanity.
          So, while the general joy at my first arrival drew
          the <rs type="persGroup" ana="#medical">hospital attendants</rs> from their post, he took the
          opportunity to carry off his wife, and conceal her. 
          The consequence was, that this morning complaints
          poured upon me of gardens robbed by <persName ref="#catalina_0001">Catalina</persName>, 
          who had carried off as much as she could, dug up
          and destroyed the rest, and had shown as little
          conscience in providing herself with <ecda:fauna ana="#commodity #food #circulation">poultry</ecda:fauna> as in
          helping herself to <ecda:flora ana="#food #commodity #circulation">vegetables</ecda:flora>. I immediately despatched
          <ecda:anonPers>one of the negro-governors</ecda:anonPers> with a <rs type="persGroup">party</rs> 
          in pursuit of her, who succeeded in lodging her
          once more in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>; where she must remain
          till I can get her sent to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">asylum</rs> at <placeName>Kingston</placeName>,
          the only hospital for lunatics in the whole <rs type="place">island</rs>.

          <p>On my former visit to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I found on my 
             <rs type="place">estate</rs> a <ecda:anonPers>poor woman</ecda:anonPers> nearly one hundred years
             old, and stone blind. She was too infirm to walk; 
             but <rs type="persGroup">two young negroes</rs> brought her on their backs
             to the steps of my house, in order, as she said, that
             she might at least touch <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>, although she could
             not see him. When she had kissed my hand, <said rend="quotes">that 
             was enough,</said> she said; <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">now me hab once kiss a
             massa's hand, me willing to die to-morrow, me no
             care</distinct>.</said> She had a <ecda:anonPers>woman</ecda:anonPers> appropriated to her
             service, and was shown the greatest care and attention;
             however, she did not live many months after
             my departure. There was also a mulatto, about
             thirty years of age, named <persName ref="#bob_0001">Bob</persName>, who had been
             almost deprived of the use of his limbs by the
             horrible <seg ana="#disease">cocoa-bay</seg>, and had never done the least
             work since he was fifteen. He was so gentle and
             humble, and so fearful, from the consciousness of
             his total inability of soliciting my notice, that I
             could not help pitying the poor fellow; and whenever
             he came in my way I always sought to
             encourage him by little presents, and other trifling
             marks of favour. His thus unexpectedly meeting
             with distinguishing kindness, where he expected to
             be treated as a worthless incumbrance, made a
             strong impression on his mind. Soon after my
             departure his malady assumed a more active appearance;
             but during the last stages of its progress
             
             
             the only fear which he expressed was, that he
             should not live till last <name>Christmas</name>, when my return
             was expected to a certaintly. In the mean while
             he endeavoured to find out a means of being of
             some little use to me, although his weak constitution
             wound not allow of his being of much. Some
             of his relations being in opulate circumstances,
             they furnished him with a <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna>, for he was too
             weak to walk  for more than a few minutes at a
             time; and, mounted upon this, he passed all his
             time in traversing the <rs type="place">estate</rs>, warning the <rs type="persGroup">pen-keepers</rs>
             if any of the <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> had found their way into the
             <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #growth">cane-pieces</ecda:flora>, and doing many other such little
             pieces of service to the property; so that, as the
             <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> said, <said rend="quotes">if he had been a white man he
             might have been taken for an overseer.</said> At length
             <name>Christmas</name> arrived; it was known that I was on the 
             sea; <persName ref="#bob_0001">Bob</persName>, too, was still alive; but still there was
             nothing to be heard of me. His perpetual question
             to all who came to visit him was, How was the
             wind? and he was constantly praying to the wind
             and the ocean to bring <distinct type="dialect">massa's</distinct> vessel soon to <placeName>Savanna
             la Mar</placeName>, that he might but see him once
             more, and thank him, before he died. At length
             I landed; and when, on the day of my arrival on
             my <rs type="place">estate</rs>, I expressed my surprise at the non-
             appearance of <rs type="persGroup">several of the negroes</rs>, who had appeared
             to be most attached to me, and I had 
             expected to find most forward in greeting me. I
             
             
             
             was told that a messenger had been sent to call
             them, and that their absence was occasioned by
             their attendance at poor <persName ref="#bob_0001">Bob's</persName> funeral. <rs type="persGroup">Several of
             his relations</rs>, who nursed him on his death-bed,
             have assured me, that the last audible words which
             he uttered were―<said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Are there still no news of

          <p>I think that I really may now venture to hope
             that my plans for the management of my estate
             have succeeded beyond even my most sanguine
             
             
             
             expectations. I have now passed three weeks with
             my <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>, the doors of my house open all day
             long, and full liberty allowed to every person to
             come and speak with me without witness or restraint;
             yet not one man or woman has come to 
             me with a single complaint. On the contrary, all
             my enquiries have been answered by an assurance,
             that during the two years of my absence my 
             regularions were adhered to most implicity, and
             that, <said rend="quotes">except for the pleasure of seeing <distinct type="dialect">massa</distinct>,</said>
             there was no more difference in treatment than
             if I had remained upon the estate. <rs type="persGroup">Many of
             them</rs> have come to tell me instances of kindness
             which they have received from one or the other of
             their superintendents; <rs type="persGroup">others</rs>, to describe some
             severe fit of illness, in which they must have died
             but for the care taken of them in the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>;
             <rs type="persGroup">some</rs>, who were weakly and low-spirited on my
             former visit, to show me how much they are improved
             in health, and tell me, <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">how they keep up 
             heart now, because since massa come upon the
             <rs type="place">property</rs> nobody put upon them, and all go well</distinct>;</said> 
             and <rs type="persGroup">some</rs>, who had formerly complained of one
             trifle or other, to take back their complaints, and
             say, that they wanted no change, and were willing
             to be employed in any way  that might be thought
             most for the good of the <rs type="place">estate</rs>; but although I
             have now at least <emph rend="italic">seen</emph> every one of them, and
             have conversed with numbers, I have not yet been
             able to find one person who had so much as even
             
             
             
             an imaginary grievance to lay before me. Yet I
             find, that it has been found necessary to <seg ana="#punishment">punish
             with the lash</seg>, although only in a very few instances;
             but then this only took place on the commission of
             absolute <emph rend="italic">crimes</emph>, and in cases where its necessity
             and justice were so universally felt, not only by 
             others, but by the sufferers themselves, that instead 
             of complaining, they seem only to be afraid of their
             offence coming to my knowledge; to prevent
             which, they affect to be more satisfied and happy
             than all the rest, and now when I see a mouth
             grinning from ear to ear with a more than ordinary
             expansion of jaw, I never fail to find, on enquiry,
             that its proprietor is one of those who have been
             punished during my absence. I then take care to
             give them an opportunity of making a complaint,
             if they should have any to make; but no, not a
             word comes; <said rend="quotes">every thing has gone on perfectly
             well, and just as it ought to have done.</said> Upon
             this, I drop a slight hint of the offence in question; 
             and instantly away goes the grin, and down falls 
             the negro to kiss my feet confess his fault, and
             <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">beg massa forgib, and them never do so bad thing

             the justice of his punishment, or complained
             of undue severity on the part of his superintendents .
             On the other hand, although <seg ana="#punishment">the lash has thus
             been in a manner utterly abolished, except in cases
             where a much severer punishment would have been
             
             
             inflicted by the police</seg>, and although they are
             aware of this unwillingness to chastise, my <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>
             acknowledges that during my absence the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> 
             have been quiet and tractable, and have not only
             laboured as well as they used to do, but have done
             much more work than the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> on the adjoining
             <rs type="place">property</rs>, where there are forty more negroes, and
             where, moreover, a considerable sum is paid for
             hired assistance. Having now waited three weeks
             to see how they would conduct themselves, and
             found no cause of dissatisfaction since the neglect
             of the <ecda:anonPers>watchman</ecda:anonPers> to guard the <ecda:fauna>cattle</ecda:fauna> (and which
             they one and all attributed to their joy at seeing
             me again), I thought it time to distribute the presents
             which I had brought with me for them from
             <placeName>England</placeName>. During my absence I had ordered a
             new and additional <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> to be built, intended
             entirely for the use of lying-in women, nursing
             mothers, and cases of a serious nature, for which
             purpose it is to be provided with every possible
             comfort; while the old <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> is to be reserved
             for those who have little or nothing the matter
             with them, but who obstinately insist upon their
             being too ill to work, in defiance of the opinion of
             all their medical attendants. The new <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> is not 
             quite finished; but wishing to connect it as much
             as possible with pleasurable associations, I took
             occasion of the distribution of presents to open it
             for the first time. Accordingly, the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> were
             summoned to the new <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs> this morning; the 
             rooms were sprinkled with <ecda:commodity ana="#food">Madeira</ecda:commodity> for good luck;
             
             
             and the toast of <said rend="quotes">Health to the new <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, and
             shame to the old lazy house!</said> was drunk by the
             <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>, the <rs type="persGroup">doctoresses</rs>, the <rs type="persGroup">governors</rs>, &amp;c., and
             received by the whole congregation of <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
             with loud cheering; after which, every man received
             a <ecda:commodity ana="#textile #circulation">blue jacket lined with flannel</ecda:commodity>, every
             woman a <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #textile">flaming red stuff petticoat</ecda:commodity>, and every
             child a <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #textile">frock of white cotton</ecda:commodity>. They then fell to
             dancing and singing, and drinking <ecda:food ana="#commodity #flora">rum and sugar</ecda:food>,
             which they kept up till a much later hour than
             would be at all approved of by the bench of
             bishops; for it is now Sunday morning, and they
             are still dancing and singing louder than ever.

          <p>To-day divine service was performed at <placeName>Savanna
          la Mar</placeName> for the first time in five weeks. The
             <ecda:anonPers>rector</ecda:anonPers> has been indisposed lately with the <seg ana="#disease">lumbago</seg>:
             he has no curate; and thus during five whole
             weeks there was a total cessation of public worship. 
             I had told <rs type="persGroup">several of my female acquaintance</rs> that
             it was long since they had been to church; that I
             was afraid of their forgetting <quote rend="quotes">all about and about
             it</quote>, and that if there should be no service for a
             week longer I should think it my duty to come
             and hear them say their <title>Catechism</title> myself. Luckily
             the <ecda:anonPers>rector</ecda:anonPers> recovered, and saved me the trouble
             of hearing them; but the long privation of public
             prayer did not seem to have created any very great
             demand for the article, as I have seldom witnessed
             
             
             a more meagre congregation. It was literally
             <quote rend="quotes" source="bible">two or three gathered together</quote>, and it seemed
             as if five or six would be too may, and forfeit the 
             promise. I cannot discover that the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> have
             any external forms of worship, nor any priests in 
             <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, unless their <seg ana="#obeah"><rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs> men</seg> should be considered
             as such; but still I cannot think that they 
             ought to be considered as totally devoid of all
             natural religion. There is no phrase so common on
             their lips as <said rend="quotes">God bless you!</said> and <said rend="quotes">God preserve
             you!</said> and <said rend="quotes">God will bless you wherever you go!</said>
             Phrases which they pronounce with every appearance
             of sincerity, and as if they came from the very
             bottom of their hearts. <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">God-A'mity! God-
             A'mity</distinct>!</said> is their constant exclamation in pain
             and in sorrow; and with this perpetual recurrence to
             the Supreme Being, it must be difficult to insist
             upon their being athiests. But they have even got 
             a step further than the belief in a God; they also
             allow the existence of an evil principle. <ecda:anonPers>One of
             them</ecda:anonPers> complained to me the other day, that when
             he went to the field his <rs type="persGroup">companions</rs> had told him
             <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that he might go to hell, for he was not worthy to
             work with them;</said> and <ecda:anonPers>one of his adversaries</ecda:anonPers> in
             return accused him of being so lazy, <said rend="quotes" direct="false">that instead 
             of being a slave upon <placeName>Cornwall</placeName> estate, he was only
             fit to be the slave of the devil.</said> Then surely they
             could not be afraid of <distinct type="dialect">duppies</distinct> (or ghosts) without
             some idea of a future state; and indeed nothing is
             more firmly impressed upon the mind of the <name>Afri-
             
             
             
             cans</name>, than that after death they shall go back to
             <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and pass an eternity in revelling and feasting
             with their ancestors. The <ecda:anonPers>proprietor </ecda:anonPers>of a
             neighbouring estate lately used all his influence to 
             persuade his <ecda:anonPers>foster-sister</ecda:anonPers> to be christened; but it
             was all in vain: she had imbibed strong <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs>
             prejudices from her mother, and frankly declared
             that she found nothing in the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> system so
             alluring to her taste as the post-obit balls and
             banquets promised by the religion of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. I 
             confess, that this prejudice appears to me to be 
             so strongly rooted, that in spite of the curates expected
             from the hands of the <rs type="person" ref="#howley_william_1766">bishop of <placeName>London</placeName></rs>,
             I am sadly afraid, that <quote rend="quotes" source="butler_hudibras">the pulpit drum ecclesiastic</quote>
             will find it a hard matter to overpower the
             gumby; and that the joys of the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> paradise
             will be seen to kick the beam, when they are
             weighed against the pleasures of eating <ecda:food ana="#fauna">fat hog</ecda:food>,
             drinking <ecda:food ana="#flora">raw rum</ecda:food>, and dancing for centuries to the
             jam-jam and kitty-katty. In the negro festivals in
             this life, the chief point lies in making as much
             noise as possible, and the <name>Africans</name> and <name>Creoles</name>
             dispute it with the greatest pertinacity. I am just
             informed that at the dance last night the <name>Eboes</name>
             obtained a decided triumph, for they roared and
             screamed and shouted and thumped their drums
             with so much effect, that the <name>Creoles</name> were fairly
             rendered deaf with the noise of their rivals, and
             dumb with their own, and obliged to leave off singing altogether.

       <p>On my arrival I found that idle rogue <persName ref="#nato_0001">Nato</persName>,
          as usual, an inmate of the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, where he regularly
          passes at least nine months out of the twelve.
          He was with infinite difficulty persuaded, at the
          end of a fortnight, to employ himself about the
          <ecda:fauna>carriage-horses</ecda:fauna> for a couple of days; but on the
          third he returned to the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, although the
          <rs type="persGroup">medical attendants</rs>, one and all, declared nothing
          to be the matter with him, and the <rs type="persGroup">doctors</rs> even
          refused to insert his name on the sick list. Still
          he persisted in declaring himself to be too ill to
          do a single stroke of work: so on Thursday I put
          him into one of the sick rooms by himself, and
          desired him to get well with the doors locked,
          which he would find to be full as easy with the
          doors open; at the same time assuring him, that
          he should never come out, till he should be sufficiently
          recovered to cut <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #harvest">canes</ecda:flora> in the field. He
          held good all Friday; but Saturday being a holy-
          day, he declared himself to be in a perfect state
          of health, and desired to be released. However,
          I was determined to make him suffer a little for his
          lying and obstinacy, and would not suffer the
          doors to be opened for him till this morning, when
          he quitted the <rs type="place" ana="#medical">hospital</rs>, saluted on all sides by loud
          huzzas in congratulation of his amended health,
          and which followed him during his whole progress
          to the <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #harvest">cane-piece</ecda:flora>, I was informed that a lad,
          
          
          named <persName ref="#epsom_0001">Epsom</persName>, who used to be perpetually running
          away, had been stationary fo the last two years.
          So on Wednesday last, as he happened to come in 
          my way, I gave him all proper commendation for
          having got rid of his bad habits; and to make
          the praise better worth his having, I added a
          <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">maccarony</ecda:commodity>: he was gratified in the extreme,
          thanked me a thousand times, promised most
          solemnly never to behave ill again, and ran away
          that very night. However, he returned on Saturday
          morning, and was brought to me all rags, tears
          and penitence, wondering <said rend="quotes" direct="false">how he could have
          had such <emph rend="italic">bad manners</emph> as to make massa fret.</said>

       <p>Some of the <rs type="persGroup">free people of colour</rs> possess <rs type="persGroup">slaves</rs>,
          <ecda:commodity ana="#fauna">cattle</ecda:commodity>, and other <ecda:commodity>property</ecda:commodity> left them by their fathers,
          and are in good circumstances; but few of them are
          industrious enough to increase their possessions by
          any honest exertions of their own. As to the <rs type="persGroup">free 
          blacks</rs>, they are almost uniformly lazy and improvident,
          most of them half-starved, and only
          anxious to live from hand to mouth. Some lounge
          about the highways with pedlar-boxes, stocked 
          with various <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">worthless baubles</ecda:commodity>; others keep miserable
          stalls provided with <ecda:food ana="#commodity #sale">rancid butter</ecda:food>, <ecda:food ana="#fauna #sale @commodity">damaged
          salt-pork</ecda:food>, and other such <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">articles</ecda:commodity>; and these they
          are always willing to exchange for stolen <ecda:commodity ana="#food #circulation">rum</ecda:commodity>
          and <ecda:commodity ana="#food #circulation">sugar</ecda:commodity>, which they secretly tempt the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> 
          to pilfer from their <rs type="persGroup">proprietors</rs>; but few of them
          
          
          
          ever make the exertion of earning their livelihood
          creditably. Even those who profess to be <rs type="persGroup">tailors</rs>,
          <rs type="persGroup">carpenters</rs>, or <rs type="persGroup">cooopers</rs>, are for the most part careless,
          drunken, and dissipated, and never take pains
          sufficient to attain any dexterity in their trade.
          As to a free negro hiring himself out for plantation
          labour, no instance of such a thing was ever 
          known in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, and probably no price, however
          great, would be considered by them as a
          sufficient temptation.

             with the bill, with which she was cutting <ecda:flora ana="#commodity #harvest">canes</ecda:flora>. 
             Luckily, his loose wrapper saved him from the

          <p><persName ref="#neptune_0001">Neptune</persName>came this morning to request that the
             name of his son, <persName ref="#oscar_0001">Oscar</persName>, might be changed for that 
             of <persName ref="#julius_00001">Julius</persName>, which (it seems), had been that of his
             own father. The child, he said, had always been
             weakly, and he was persuaded, that its ill-health
             proceeded from his deceased grandfather's being
             displeased, because it had not been called after
             him. The other day, too, a <ecda:anonPers>woman</ecda:anonPers>, who had a
             child sick in the hospital, begged me to change its
             name for any other which might please me best:
             she cared not what; but she was sure that it
             would never do well, so long as it should be called
             <persName ref="#lucia_0001">Lucia</persName>. Perhaps this prejudice respecting the
             power of names produces in some measure their
             unwillingness to be christened. They find no
             change produced in them, except the alteration of
             their name, and hence they conclude that this 
             name contains in it some secret power; while, on the
             other hand, they conceive that the ghosts of their
             ancestors cannot fail to be offended at their abandoning 
             an appellation, either hereditary in the family, or
             given by themselves. It is another negro-prejudice
             that the eructation of the breath of a sucking
             child has something in it venemous; and frequently
             <rs type="persGroup">nursing mothers</rs>, on showing the <rs type="person">doctor</rs> a

             <rs type="place">estate</rs> litigated between several parties. At length
             a decision was given: the estate was sold for
             <measure ana="#currency">16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</measure>; but the lawyer's claim must always be
             the first discharged, and as this amounted to more
             than <measure ana="#currency">16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</measure> the <ecda:anonPers>lawyer</ecda:anonPers> found himself in possession 
             of the <rs type="place">estate</rs>. This was the fable of <persName ref="#aesop_620">Æsop's</persName> 
             <ecda:fauna>oyster</ecda:fauna> put in action with a vengeance.

          <p>A negro, named <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>, has long been the terror
             of my whole estate. He was accused of being an
             <rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs>-man, and persons notorious for the practice
             of <name>Obeah</name> had been found concealed from justice
             in his house, who were afterwards convicted and
             transported. He was strongly suspected of having
             <seg ana="#poison">poisoned more than <rs type="persGroup">twelve negroes, men and
             
             
             
             women</rs>; and having been displaced by my <ecda:anonPers>former
             trustee</ecda:anonPers> from being principal governor, in revenge
             he put poison in his water jar. Luckily he was
             observed by <ecda:anonPers>one of the house servants</ecda:anonPers>, who impeached 
             him, and prevented the intended mischief.</seg> 
             For this offence he ought to have been given up to
             justice; but being brother of the <ecda:anonPers>trustee's <ecda:anonPers>mistress</ecda:anonPers></ecda:anonPers>
             she found means to get him off, after undergoing a
             <seg ana="#punishment">long confinement in the stocks</seg>. I found him, on
             my arrival, living in a state of utter excommunication;
             I tried what reasoning with him could effect,
             reconciled him to his companions, treated him with
             marked kindness, and he promised solemnly to
             behave well during my absence. However, instead 
             of attributing my lenity to a wish to reform him,
             his pride and confidence in his own talents and
             powers of deception made him attribute the indulgence
             shown him to his having obtained an
             influence over my mind. This he determined to 
             employ to his own purposes upon my return; so
             he set about forming a conspiracy against <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Sully</persName>,
             the present chief governor, and boasted on various
             estates in the neighbourhood that on my arrival
             he would take care to get <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Sully</persName> broke, and himself
             substituted in his place. In the mean while he
             quarrelled and fought to the right and to the left;
             and on my arrival I found the whole <rs type="place">estate</rs> in an
             uproar over <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>. No less than three charges of 
             assault, with intent to kill, were preferred against
             him. In a fit of jealousy he had endeavoured to
             
             
             strangle <persName ref="#marlborough_0001">Marlborough</persName> with the thong of a whip, and
             had nearly effected his purpose before he could be
             dragged away: he ahd knocked <persName ref="#nato_0001">Nato</persName> down in
             some trifling dispute, and while the man was senseless
             had thrown him into the river to drown him;
             and having taken offence at a poor weak creature
             called <persName ref="#old_rachel_0001">Old Rachel</persName>, on meeting her by accident
             he struck her to the ground, beat her with a supple-
             jack, stamped upon her belly, and begged her to be
             assured of his intention (as he eloquently worded
             it) <said rend="quotes" direct="false">to kick her guts out.</said> <seg ana="#poison">The <rs type="persGroup">breeding mothers</rs>
             also accused him of having been the cause of the 
             poisoning a particular spring, from which they
             were in the habit of fetching water for their <rs type="persGroup">children</rs>,
             as <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> on that morning had been seen
             near the spring without having any business there,
             and he had been heard to caution his <ecda:anonPers>little daughter</ecda:anonPers>
             against drinking water from it that day, although
             he stoutly denied both circumstances.</seg> Into the bargain,
             my <ecda:anonPers>head blacksmith</ecda:anonPers> being perfectly well at 
             five o'clock, was found by his son dead in his bead at
             eight; and it was known that he had lately had a
             dispute with <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>, who on that day had made it
             up with him, and invited him to drink,
             although it was not certain that his offer had been 
             accepted. He had, moreover, threatened the lives
             of <rs type="persGroup">many of the best negroes</rs>. <seg ana="#poison"><rs type="persGroup">Two of the cooks</rs>
             declared, that he had severally directed them to 
             dress <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Sully's</persName> food apart, and had given them
             powders to mix with it. <ecda:anonPers>The first</ecda:anonPers> to whom he ap-
             
             
             plied refused positively; the second he treated
             with <ecda:food>liquor</ecda:food>, and when she had drunk, he gave her
             the poison, with instructions how to use it. Being 
             a timid creature, she did not dare to object, so
             threw away the powder privately, and pretended
             that it had been administered; <seg ana="#obeah">but finding no
             effect produced by it, <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> gave her a second
             powder, at the same time bidding her remember
             the <ecda:food>liquor</ecda:food> which she had swallowed, and which
             he assured her would effect her own destruction
             through it by the force of <name>Obeah</name>, unless she prevented
             it by sacrificing his enemy in her stead.</seg> The
             <ecda:anonPers>poor creature</ecda:anonPers> still threw away the powder, but the
             strength of imagination brought upon her a serious
             malady, and it was not till after several
             weeks that she recovered from the effects of her
             fears. </seg>The terror thus produced was universal
             throughout the estate, and <persName ref="#duke_of_sully_0001">Sully's</persName> and <rs type="persGroup">several other
             principal negroes</rs> requested me to remove them to
             my property in <placeName>St. Thomas's</placeName>, as their lives were
             not safe while breathing the same air with <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName>.
             However, it appeared a more salutary measure to
             remove <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> himself; but all the poisoning
             charges either went no further than strong suspicion,
             or (any more than the assaults) were not
             liable by the laws of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> to be punished,
             except by flogging or temporary imprisonment,
             which would only have returned him to the estate 
             with increased resentment against those to whom
             he should ascribe his sufferings, however deserved.
             
             
             However, on searching his house, a musket with a
             plentiful accompaniment of powder and ball was
             found concealed, as also <seg ana="#obeah">a considerable quantity of
             materials for the practice of <name>Obeah</name></seg>: <seg ana="#punishment">the possession
             of either of the above articles (if the musket is without
             the consent of the proprietor) authorises the <rs type="persGroup">magistrates</rs> 
             to pronounce a sentence of transportation. 
             In consequence of this discovery, <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> was immediately
             committed to gaol; a slave court was 
             summoned, and to-day a sentence of transportation 
             from the <rs type="place">island</rs> was pronounced, after a trial of 
             three hours.</seg> As to the man's guilt, of that the
             <rs type="persGroup">jury</rs> entertained no doubt after the first half hour's
             evidence; and the only difficulty was to restrain
             the verdict to transportation. We produced nothing
             which could possibly affect the man's life;
             for although perhaps no offender ever better deserved
             hanging; yet I confess my being weak-
             minded enough to entertain doubts whether hanging
             or other capital punishment ought to be
             inflicted for any offence whatever: I am at least
             certain, that if offenders waited till they were
             hanged by me, they would remain unhanged till
             they were so many old <name>Parrs</name>. However,
             although Idid my best to prevent <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> from
             being hanged, it was no easy matter to prevent his
             hanging himself. The <name>Obeah</name> ceremonies always
             commence with what is called, by the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
             <distinct type="ethnographic" rend="quotes">the <rs type="properAdjective">Myal</rs> dance</distinct>. This is intended to remove
             any doubt of the chief <rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs>-man's supernatural
             
             
             powers; and in the course of it, he undertakes to
             show his art by killing one of the persons present,
             whom he pitches upon for that purpose. He
             sprinkles various powers over the devoted victim,
             blows upon him, and dances round him, obliges
             him to drink a liquor prepared for the occasion,
             and finally the sorcerer and his assistance seize him
             and whirl him rapidly round and round till the man
             loses his sense, and falls on the ground to all
             appearance and the belief of the spectators a
             perfect corpse. The chief <rs type="properAdjective">Myal</rs>-man then utters
             loud shrieks, rushes out of the house with wild
             and frantic gestures, and conceals himself in some
             neighbouring wood. At the end of two or three
             hours he returns with a large bundle of <ecda:flora>herbs</ecda:flora>, 
             from some of which he squeezes the juice into the
             mouth of the dead person; with others he anoints
             his eyes and stains the tips of his fingers, accompanying
             the ceremony with a great variety of 
             grotesque actions, and chanting all the while some<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">-</unclear>
             thing between a song and a howl, while the assistants
             hand in hand dance slowly round them in
             a circle, stamping the ground loudly with their feet
             to keep time with his chant. A considerable time
             elapses before the desired effect is produced, but
             at length the corpse gradually recovers animation,
             rises from the ground perfectly recovered, and the
             <rs type="properAdjective">Myal</rs> dance concludes. <seg ana="#poison">After this proof of his
             power, those who wish to be revenged upon their
             enemies apply to the sorcerer for some of the same
             
             
             
             powder, which produced apparent death upon their
             companion, and as they never employ the means
             used for his recovery, of course the powder once
             adminstered never fails to be lastingly fatal. It
             must be superfluous to mention that the <rs type="properAdjective">Myal</rs>-man
             on this second occasion substitutes a poison for a
             narcotic.</seg> Now, among other suspicious articles
             found in <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam's</persName> hut, there was a string of beads
             of various sizes, shapes, and colours, arranged in a
             form peculiar to the performance of the <rs type="properAdjective">Obeah</rs>-
             man in the <rs type="properAdjective">Myal</rs> dance. Their use was so well
             known, that <persName ref="#adam_0002">Adam</persName> did not even attempt
             to deny that they could serve for no purpose but
             the practice of <name>Obeah</name>; but he endeavoured to
             refute their being his own property, and with this
             view he began to narrate the means by which he
             had become possessed of them. He said that they
             belonged to <persName ref="#fox_0001">Fox</persName> (a negro who was lately transported),
             from whom he had taken them at a <rs type="properAdjective">Myal</rs> 
             dance heald on the estate of <placeName>Dean's Valley</placeName>; but as
             the assistants at one of these dances are by law
             condemned to death equally with the principal
             performer, the court had the humanity to <choice><sic>interrpnt</sic><corr>interrupt</corr></choice>
             his confession of having been present on such an
             occasion, and thus saved him from criminating
             himself so deeply as to render a capital punishment
             inevitable. I understand that he was quite unabashed
             and at his ease the whole time; upon
             hearing his sentence, he only said very coolly,
             <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Well! I ca'n't help it!</distinct></said> turned himself round,
             
             
             and walked out of court. That nothing might be
             wanting, this fellow even had a decided talent for
             hypocrisy. When on my arrival he gave me a
             letter filled with the grossest lies respecting the
             <ecda:anonPers>trustee</ecda:anonPers>, and <rs type="persGroup">every creditable negro</rs> on the <rs type="place">estate</rs>,
             he took care to sign it by the name which he had
             lately received in baptism; and in his defence at
             the bar to prove his probity of character and
             purity of manners, he informed the court that for
             some time past he had been learning to read, for
             the sole purpose of learning the <title>Lord's Prayer</title>.
             The nick-name by which he was generally known
             among the <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs> in this part of the country, was
             <persName>Buonaparte</persName>, and he always appeared to exult in
             the appellation. Once condemned, the marshal
             is bound under a heavy penalty to see him shipped
             from off the island before the expiration of six
             weeks, and probably he will be sent to <placeName>Cuba</placeName>. He
             is a fine-looking man between thirty and forty,
             square built, and of great bodily strength, and his
             countenance equally expresses intelligence and
             malignity. The sum allowed me for him is <measure ana="#currency">one
             hundred pounds currency</measure>, which is scarcely a
             third of his worth as a labourer, but which is the
             highest value which a jury is permitted to mention.

       <p>Last night the negroes of <placeName>Friendship</placeName> took it into
          their ingenious heads to pay me a compliment of
          an extremely inconvenient nature. They thought,
          
          
          
          that it would be highly proper to treat me with a
          nightly serenade just by way of showing their
          <emph rend="italic">enjoyment</emph> on my return; and accordingly a large
          body of them arrived at my doors about midnight,
          dressed out in their best clothes, and accompanied
          with drums, rattles, and their whole orchestra of
          abominable instruments, determined to pass the
          whole night in singing and dancing under my
          windows. Luckily, my <rs type="persGroup">negro-governors</rs> heard what
          was going forwards, and knowing my taste a little
          better than my visiters, they hastened to assure
          them of my being in bed and asleep, and with
          much difficulty persuaded them to remove into my
          <rs type="place">village</rs>. Here they contented themselves with
          making a noise for the greatest part of the night;
          and the next morning, after coming up to see me
          at breakfast, they went away quietly. One of them
          only remained to enquire particularly after <persName ref="lady_h_0001">Lady
          H―</persName>, as her mother had been her nurse, and
          she was very particular in her enquiries as to her
          health, her children, their ages and names. When
          she went away, I gave her plentiful provision of
          <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food">bread</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food">butter</ecda:commodity>, <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food #flora">plantains</ecda:commodity>, and <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food #fauna">cold ham</ecda:commodity> from the
          breakfast table; part of which she sat down to eat,
          intending, as she said, to carry the rest to her
          <ecda:anonPers><distinct type="dialect">piccaninny</distinct></ecda:anonPers> at home. But in half an hour after she
          made her appearance again, saying she was come
          to take leave of me, and hoped I would give her
          a <emph rend="italic">bit</emph> to buy <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">tobacco</ecda:commodity>. I gave her a <ecda:commodity ana="#currency">maccaroni</ecda:commodity>,
          which occasioned a great squall of delight. Oh!
          
          
          
          since I had given her so much, she would not buy
          <ecda:commodity ana="#sale">tobacco</ecda:commodity> but a <ecda:commodity ana="#fauna">fowl</ecda:commodity>; and then, when I returned
          she would bring me a <ecda:food ana="#fauna">chicken</ecda:food> from it for my 
          <ecda:food>dinner</ecda:food>; that is, if she could keep the other <rs type="persGroup">negroes</rs>
          from stealing it from her, a piece of extraordinary
          good luck of which she seemed to entertain but
          slender hopes. At length off she set; but she had
          scarcely gone above <measure>ten yards</measure> from the house,
          when she turned back, and soon at my writing-
          table once more, with a <said rend="quotes"><distinct type="dialect">Well! here me come to
          massa again</distinct>!</said> So then she said, that she had
          meant to eat a part of the <ecda:commodity ana="#food #circulation">provisions</ecda:commodity> which I had
          given her, and carry home the rest to her boy;
          but that really it was so good, that she could not help
          going on eating and eating, till she had eaten
          the whole, and now she wanted another bit of <ecda:commodity ana="#circulation #food #fauna">cold
          ham</ecda:commodity> to carry home to her child, and then she should
          go away perfectly contented. I ordered <persName ref="#cubina">Cubina</persName>
          to give her a great hunch of it, and <persName ref="#phillis_0002">Mrs. Phillis</persName> at 
          length took her departure for good and all.

          <p>I set out to visit my estate in <placeName>St. Thomas's in
          the East</placeName>, called <placeName>Hordley</placeName>. It is at the very furthest
             extremity of the island, and never was there a 
             journey like unto my journey. Something disagreeable
             happened at every step; my accidents
             commenced before I had accomplished <measure>ten miles</measure>
             from my own house; for in passing along a narrow
             shelf of rock, which hoverhangs the sea near <placeName>Blue-
             
             
             
             fields</placeName>, a pair of young <ecda:fauna>blood-horses</ecda:fauna> in my carriage
             took fright at the roaring of the waves which dashed
             violently against them, and twice nearly overturned
             me. On the second occasion one of them actually
             fell down into the water, while the off-wheel of the
             curricle flew up into the air, and thus it remained
             suspended, balancing backwards and forwards, like
             <persName>Mahomet's</persName> coffin. Luckily, time was allowed the
             <ecda:fauna>horse</ecda:fauna> to recover his legs, down came the wheel
             once more on terra firma, and on we went again.
             We slept at <placeName>Cashew</placeName> (an estate near <placeName>Lacovia</placeName>), and
             the next morning at daylight proceeded to climb
             the <placeName>Bogr</placeName>, a mountain so difficult, that every one
             had pronounced the attempt to be hopeless with
             <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> so young as mine; but those <ecda:fauna>horses</ecda:fauna> were
             my only ones, and therefore I was obliged to make
             the trial. The road is bordered by tremendous
             precipices for about <measure>twelve miles</measure>; the path is so
             narrow, that a servant must always be sent on before
             to make any carts which may be descending
             stop in
