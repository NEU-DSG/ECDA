Below is a listing of common elements, attributes, and values we will use in our markup:


*XML Commenting* 
when you encounter something you are unsure about marking up, or have a general note or question about the document to the editors, please use, 
<!-- ... -->
where "..." is your note, question, comment


*SYNTAX/STRUCTURE*
**BASIC**
<p class="a-paragraph" id="my-paragraph"></p>

- where 'p' is the element, 'class' and 'id' are attributes of the element, and 'a-paragraph' and 'my-paragraph' are values of the given the classes.
-- You might think of class as categories that conceptually group elements (e.g., this is a paragraph that share qualities w/ all paragraphs; or this is a paragraph that shares qualities w/ paragraphs contained within the body of a text, but not the front matter of a text)
-- -- You might think of id as the unique identifier of the content contained in element (e.g., this is a paragraph that Ben wrote)
-- -- -- You can add multiple class values to an element:
<p class="a-paragraph a-paragraph-mainbody" id="my-paragraph"></p>

**NESTING**
<div>
  <p>Here is a <a href="#">link</a> to some content.</p>
</div>
- note how <div> is the parent element of both <p> and <a>, and <p> is the parent of <a> (or, <a> is the child of both <p> and <div> because it is contained within <p> and within <div>

*SOME RULES*
**Open Tag :: Close Tag**
In almost all cases, an HTML element requires both open (<>) and close (</>) tags: <div>...</div>
<img> is one you do not: <img src="http://mydomain.com/myimages/image1234567.jpg">
**PROPER NESTING**
correct: <div><p></p></div>
incorrect: <div><p></div></p>
**Tag vs tag**
correct:<div></div>
incorrect:<Div></div>
